5019	#PARCC bring back the math NJASK! it is a fair assessment unlike the PARCC which tests reading comprehension instead of math skills!
5020	my honors algebra class rated the PARCC ridiculous! main complaint was confusing and poorly worded questions. sad #PARCC

5066	@erickalenze @MichaelPetrilli @JonahEdelman Yes... Sound evidence. Basic psychometric soundness data 4 #PARCC remains conspicuously absent.
5067	@erickalenze @MichaelPetrilli @JonahEdelman Evidence based practices=premised on demonstrably sound evidence (which #PARCC scores are not).
5072	@keithleger1 @LouisianaStand No data is better than bad data. Who wins in #optout ? Teachers students schools.. #morethanascore #FSA

5077	30 minutes in and the test isn't functioning for anyone this is Reynoldsburg schools for ya. #PARCC #parcctest
5083	@BSPARCCAnwsers a high stakes test designed to engineer school failure is not comparable to any other test. Opt Out. @esanzi @fnoschese
5094	@thausman TY for your admission about students being confused when taking the #SBAC questions. #waleg #waedu
5095	@GoogleForEdu I'd rather have my school spend $$$ on airconditioning arts and paper pencil tests than the unvalid #PARCC test.
5098	It's testing season. 70%-97% will fail. Time to #OptOut now! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEv2PMS47hs�__�_ @JessedHagopian @DianeRavitch @UnitedOptOut
5101	@CMZR yep when writing clear and concisely is valued everywhere except #PARCC yet they can predict future success. I don't think so! #KISS
5102	#PARCC #SBAC know their tests are bad. That's why teachers not allowed to look. http://bit.ly/1CMSQW7 #TBATSpic.twitter.com/j3wX9EEgur
5109	I #optoutbecause the #PARCC tests are RIGGED FOR FAILURE and not because they are hard. #StopCommonCore #trishmustgo @NYGovCuomo @NTampio

5113	So my cousin supposedly said that the PARCC test is as unorganized as the collapse of the Soviet Union. Lol #PARCC
5127	. @NTampio @DataDiva #NCLB law reqs use of demonstrably reliable & valid tests. Such data=notably absent 4 #PARCC so doesn't meet legal reqs.
5135	@HuffPostEdu Yes refuse the tests that only measure anything your socioeconomic level. #StopCommonCore #optout
5143	. @examinercom Think standardized tests are meaningful? When was the last time you asked your physician for his SAT scores? #optout

5190	@PARCCPlace How is it possible that an UNSUCCESSFUL test can prepare students for success? #PARCC is not working #pearson #noparcc
5212	#pearsoniswatching #PARCC #SBAC Too many Questions. YOU take the tests! You'd flunk #TBATS pic.twitter.com/x6zF6fo4pQ @BadassTeachersA

5246	@PARCCPlace Reflect? Or measure? Your test doesn't teach anything. That's a sales pitch. How well does it measure? Do you care? #PARCC
5248	@HuffPostEdu I did. It's excessive & poorly/prematurely implemented. High stakes is cruel & counter-productive we want no part of it #optout
5257	@HuffPostEdu Of course I would opt out! An inappropriate test is a terrible method to use in deciding if my child is progressing. #optout
5259	@NancyOsborne180 @BadassTeachersA Teachers probably can't see #PARCC since it's full of errors - guarantees low scores w/teachers to blame.
5264	Millions of children sit in front of screens trying to muddle through a clumsy interface and weeks of testing. #TheWalkingDead #PARCC
5269	Question #pearsoniswatching Why are you making #PARCC so hard? High stake misery @BadassTeachersA #TBATSpic.twitter.com/vY5VHMU013
5279	@nyschoolboards Why should our kids take the test before they are fixed"? #OptOut #PEARSON."
5285	@NicholasFerroni @LesaWilbert #satchat #PARCC I'm becoming more skeptical because it doesn't seem so student centered as intended or sold
5043	So my third grader won't get to see her #PARCC exam results? #wtf Massachusetts? Maybe next year we will suggest a #PARCCWALKOUT
5056	I know what I'd like to tell them: #optout and study for AP exams that actually matter. @mieducation @BadassTeachersA @SmarterBalanced

2031	Ps who agree w ASA that the data is useless will #optout and the @charteralliance can compete w each other for test scores. @ninacharters

2113	@JonCampbellGAN amazing how quick the turn around can be when there are 200000 less tests to score. #optout
2135	@brittanyhorn see what happens when there are 200000 fewer tests to grade #optout #refusethetest
2151	@MercyMercyf @dabuffum @whec_rleclair with so many #optout fewer tests to grade can get results sooner. Next yr results ready in May! Ha!
2163	Just had to take the PARCC algebra 1 test.. There wasn't a single problem I knew how to do. #parcc
2167	Unions losing public support Majority of public disagrees with #optout. http://goo.gl/DWpA05 @Choire
2208	@TLT16 Yes the digital divide is real & w states' testing on computers (i.e. #PARCC) students w/o tech experience suffer. Libraries help.
2276	. @paigekowalski @benschulzey1 That's 9 10 or 11 given no grade 12 #PARCC. They expect kids'll be college ready" by 11th grade or earlier?"
2277	You know the PARCC was out of stories when they made you read one about the deconstruction of twinkies #PARCC #Pearson
2307	@cuddlylmj its a stupid standardized test that everyone in nj in grades 3-11 have to take but it doesn't even count so you can opt out of it

2418	3rd grade PARCC had a question on money. That's not a 3rd grade standard. This is not aligned. #optout
