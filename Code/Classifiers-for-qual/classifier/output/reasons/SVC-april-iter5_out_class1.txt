2031	Ps who agree w ASA that the data is useless will #optout and the @charteralliance can compete w each other for test scores. @ninacharters
2073	I will steer my own children away from any college placing faith in #PARCC #SBAC as readiness & placement measures. http://www.edcentral.org/course-placement/ …
2075	Decision to use #CCSS test scores for college placement is troublesome http://www.edcentral.org/course-placement/ … It's too soon to consider #PARCC #SB authentic
2100	How can test results be compared across states if no consistent grading method? #CommonCore #PARCC http://wp.me/p4ySte-v8z  via @news4buffalo
2113	@JonCampbellGAN amazing how quick the turn around can be when there are 200000 less tests to score. #optout
2135	@brittanyhorn see what happens when there are 200000 fewer tests to grade #optout #refusethetest
2151	@MercyMercyf @dabuffum @whec_rleclair with so many #optout fewer tests to grade can get results sooner. Next yr results ready in May! Ha!
2163	Just had to take the PARCC algebra 1 test.. There wasn't a single problem I knew how to do. #parcc
2167	Unions losing public support   Majority of public disagrees with #optout. http://goo.gl/DWpA05 @Choire
2208	@TLT16 Yes the digital divide is real & w states' testing on computers (i.e. #PARCC) students w/o tech experience suffer. Libraries help.
2276	. @paigekowalski @benschulzey1 That's 9 10 or 11 given no grade 12 #PARCC. They expect kids'll be college ready" by 11th grade or earlier?"
2277	You know the PARCC was out of stories when they made you read one about the deconstruction of twinkies #PARCC #Pearson
2282	. @paigekowalski @benschulzey1 What's not clear is which grade level of #PARCC results colleges will accept 4 placemnt? Grade 11 scores only?
2307	@cuddlylmj its a stupid standardized test that everyone in nj in grades 3-11 have to take but it doesn't even count so you can opt out of it
2350	Psychologist: #CommonCore Tests Cannot Be Independently Verified for Validity or Reliability http://wp.me/p2odLa-aem #ccss #optout #education
2386	. @benschulzey1 @paigekowalski #BARCC & #SBAC developed #CCSS tests for each grade 9-12? Will these high schl tests be administered this yr?
2401	No kidding. The Common Core Tests Cannot Be Independently Verified for Validity or Reliability http://wp.me/p2odLa-aem #OptOut
2418	3rd grade PARCC had a question on money. That's not a 3rd grade standard. This is not aligned. #optout
2421	Honestly #sbac testing isn't even accurate and it's just wasting 3 hours of my life for 4 days

2926	. @doctordea @ISBEnews @PARCCPlace What is known re: false positive & false negative rates of #PARCC vs current measures? #CCSS #CommonCore
2934	. @alexanderrusso Prof eval stndrds req tests be validated before large scale use. Notion #optout's undermining validity is inane @arneduncan
3958	. @NYGovCuomo we already knew the tests are meaningless. It's why we #OptOut our kids! #InvalidMeasure @NYStateBATs @NYBATs @NYSAPE @LIOptOut
5139	. @Eduflack @arneduncan @ehanford Which shines light on Q as 2 whether or not #CCSS tests (NY & #PARCC) meet #ESEA reqs re: reliable & valid?
5150	. @SmarterBalanced @DrGaryWaddell What is known re: the false positive vs false negative rates of #SBAC scores (relative 2 current indices)?
5602	. @mritzius @mpolikoff @ThadDomina As w #ESEA #IDEA reqs use of demonstrably reliable & valid tests (which #PARCC is not) so threat is moot.
6861	. @anya1anya @brianparra #NCLB mandates demonstrably reliable & valid tests which precludes those lacking such data such as #PARCC & #SBAC
7422	. @DataDiva @audhilly What doesn't bode well 4 NYS #CCSS tests (& #PARCC/ #SBAC) = most if not all released items are incredulously ambiguous?
7515	. @PearsonNorthAm why does it take 3-4 mos to get #SBAC & #parcc test results back? Oh yeah you hire scorers @Craig's List. #OptOut #ESEA
7887	@DataDiva @PARCCPlace Metrics by which #PARCC results are reported show it's norm-ref (as does fact cut scores are based on scaled scores).
8227	@kcranews . @TomTorlakson Teachers can't use test scores 2 plan b/c scores come late summer when students are gone. #optout . @BadassTeachersA
8992	. @jgmac1106 @DataDiva The law reqs use of tests which are demonstrably reliable & valid hence the 95% concern = cart before horse. #optout
9126	. @DrPegLuksik These tests are invalid and unreliable! #refusethetest
9173	. @l_tepe @SmarterBalanced @PARCCPlace @educationweek What is known re: false positive & false negative rates 4 #PARCC & #SBAC? #CommonCore
9322	@DataDiva @getwhatugive That's the cart before the horse ( #ESEA explicitly reqs already validated tests which precludes use of #PARCC 3-8)?
9444	. @PoliticsK12 Given #NCLB explicitly reqs use of tests which are demonstrably reliable & valid #PARCC & #SBAC don't serve that 3-8 purpose?
9468	.@ValentinaK_edu @Andrelamme @edpolicy @PARCCPlace Is that 2 say #PARCC is a norm-referenced test? Cut scores are not predictive thresholds?
10000	. @allinwithchris . @chrislhayes Tisch is wrong.The tests are a big money maker 4 the educational industrial complex #optout . @BadassTeachersA
11497	. @JoshuaPStarr Good as in have basic reliability & validity data req by professionl eval stndrds? Such data=notably absent 4 #PARCC/ #SBAC.
12040	. @AssessWell @leoniehaimson After some years we'll see any correlation between #PARCC scores and college GPA... but how valid is that?
12052	. @PARCCPlace What data support validity of conclusions based on #PARCC? What is known re: false positive & false negative rates? @denverpost
12057	. @PARCCPlace What data support validity of conclusions based on #PARCC? What is known re: false positive & false negative rates? @Callie_DC
12311	. @BadassTeachersA OMG! #OptOut! Reliability is not enough
12685	. @cateswin public schools should be assessed on #customerservice of high validity before #parcc #nochildleftbehind of #dubious #validity

13753	. @COJasonGlass Biased how so? Relative 2 normative data (score distributions by grade)? Supposedly #PARCC/ #SBAC are criterion- vs norm-ref?
13772	. @rpondiscio @arotherham @usnews Is naive 2 dub #optout ridiculous & selfish" without acknowledging probs with use of not validated tests?"
13774	. @rpondiscio @arotherham @USNewsOpinion The #elephantinroom issue is fact #PARCC/ #SBAC lack basic psychometric soundness data 2 justify use?
13889	Think standardized tests are all that?" When was the last time you asked your doctor for her SAT scores? #optout #noparccing"
14882	. @rpondiscio Unfortunately policy experts" are persuasive in their (misleading) claims re: value of not validated tests (such as #PARCC)..."
