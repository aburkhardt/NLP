8955	. @jgmac1106 @arotherham @MichaelPetrilli Am not sure many tests used 4 #ESEA reqs are great... What's clear is #PARCC/ #SBAC are problematic.
8959	@jgmac1106 @arotherham @MichaelPetrilli Reqs use of validated indicators of those goals. #PARCC/ #SBAC lack basic reliability & validity data
9467	@DataDiva @RachelAnneLevy @akilbello Only 2 extent the data are demonstrably valid indicators of meaningful constructs (which #PARCC is not)
9597	#PARCC bring back the math NJASK! it is a fair assessment unlike the PARCC which tests reading comprehension instead of math skills!
9599	my honors algebra class rated the PARCC ridiculous! main complaint was confusing and poorly worded questions. sad #PARCC

9935	So my third grader won't get to see her #PARCC exam results? #wtf Massachusetts? Maybe next year we will suggest a #PARCCWALKOUT

10620	@CMZR yep when writing clear and concisely is valued everywhere except #PARCC yet they can predict future success. I don't think so! #KISS
10666	#PARCC #SBAC know their tests are bad. That's why teachers not allowed to look. http://bit.ly/1CMSQW7 #TBATSpic.twitter.com/j3wX9EEgur

13923	. @NTampio @DataDiva #NCLB law reqs use of demonstrably reliable & valid tests. Such data=notably absent 4 #PARCC so doesn't meet legal reqs.
13956	@HuffPostEdu Yes refuse the tests that only measure anything your socioeconomic level. #StopCommonCore #optout
13962	. @Jeffreyweissdmn @PhillyLitigator @rsaeks @PARCCPlace You can't wreck what doesn't exist. #PARCC #constructvalidity data is notably absent.

14547	@HuffPostEdu yes #optout. I've seen the NYS #pearson Common Core tests & they r poorly constructed the scores unreliable poor measurement.

14634	Merryl Tisch if feedback from tests is vital why can't I see the exam and know which questions each student got wrong. #PARCC #nysape
14635	@HuffPostEdu @FLGOPMajority Yes b/c the curriculum is narrow - only subjects tested are taught! #parcc #pearson #suspendfsa
14698	@PARCCPlace Reflect? Or measure? Your test doesn't teach anything. That's a sales pitch. How well does it measure? Do you care? #PARCC
14710	@HuffPostEdu I did. It's excessive & poorly/prematurely implemented. High stakes is cruel & counter-productive we want no part of it #optout
14731	@HuffPostEdu Of course I would opt out! An inappropriate test is a terrible method to use in deciding if my child is progressing. #optout

15571	@NancyOsborne180 @BadassTeachersA Teachers probably can't see #PARCC since it's full of errors - guarantees low scores w/teachers to blame.
15676	Millions of children sit in front of screens trying to muddle through a clumsy interface and weeks of testing. #TheWalkingDead #PARCC
15782	Question #pearsoniswatching Why are you making #PARCC so hard? High stake misery @BadassTeachersA #TBATSpic.twitter.com/vY5VHMU013
15822	It's pretty clear #PARCC #PEARSON #SBAC & #FSA have something to hide. Crappy tests that don't measure what they claim and designed to fail.
16011	@nyschoolboards Why should our kids take the test before they are fixed"? #OptOut #PEARSON."
19122	. @PARCCPlace Tchrs say #PARCC tests yield scores which are not particularly meaningful (re: informing decisions tchrs have duty 2 support)?
21204	@DataDiva @getwhatugive #NCLB reqs use of demonstrably reliable & valid tests whch #PARCC/ #SBAC are not (hence don't satisfy #NCLB mandate)

21874	@DataDiva Have said #PARCC has not met req of demonstrably reliable & valid" given that basic data remains notably absent (not shared yet)."
22042	@DataDiva Yes legislation reqs use of (validated) reading & math tests or ELA & math tests (ELA tests #PARCC or otherwise are not req).
22065	. @MichaelPetrilli @rweingarten #PARCC doesn't meet #NCLB req 4 use of demonstrably reliable & valid tests (not even test-retest reliability)

23990	@miaminewsnow However many other schools are going forward such as... @OCPSnews and @pcschools .How can these tests be valid? #optout
24133	These tests are so pointless #PARCC
24336	. @bwrighted @MichaelPetrilli @educationgadfly Many current tests are reasonably well validated. Which is why hasty move 2 #PARCC = puzzling.
24384	. @bwrighted @MichaelPetrilli @educationgadfly The converse is true when the tests opted-out-of are not demonstrably reliable & valid. #PARCC
24416	. @educationgadfly @MichaelPetrilli @WOSUAllSides Only 2 extent those tests are demonstrably reliable & valid (which #PARCC clearly is not).
24453	. @MichaelPetrilli @WOSUAllSides @OhioGadfly Opting out of tests whch lack basic validity & reliability data (such as #PARCC/ #SBAC) = prudent
26343	@dgburris @DataDiva @getwhatugive @Caplee62 Given #NCLB explicitly reqs demonstrably reliable & valid measures #PARCC/ #SBAC don't qualify?
