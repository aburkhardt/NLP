    "This named entity recognition task used the sequence classifier of HMM. However,an Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) might serve to improve the Precision and Recall. Using an MEMM would allow us to have both the IOB tagging, as well as other features that could be useful in determining whether or not a word or sequence of words is a gene. Some other features that I could use could be: if the token is a non-alphanumeric characeter (e.g., \"(\", \")\" or \"-\", if the token us upper-case, if the token doesn't contain any vowels (e.g., Sp1, mRNA). |"
