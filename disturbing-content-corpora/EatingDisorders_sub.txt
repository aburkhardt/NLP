I apologize for the length of the post. Thank you for hearing me out. My boyfriend and I grew up in the same small town and have been friends for over 6 years, though we only got together this year and are doing long distance until I graduate. He has been struggling with anorexia for years, probably for the whole time we were friends, but I didn't really know the severity until recently, obviously. Somehow, half a year after he started opening up to me about his feelings, I have convinced him to go see a therapist as soon as we return home for winter break (in 2 weeks) until we can find more specialized help. He asked me to go with him (which I was going to do anyway) because he wants me to make sure he doesn't lie to the therapist. When I asked him if he wants to get better he said that logically he knows he should want to but he's really not sure. It breaks my heart every time he eats a small meal and immediately feels guilty and fat. I have seen a lot of articles about supporting girlfriends and wives with EDs but never really about how to help a male partner. I know it should really be the same but I can't help but feel like it's at least a slightly different dynamic? (don't know how to properly word this feeling, sorry) I have been reading up on anorexia and the psychology behind it to help better understand what he is going through, but I know that I will never really understand. I just want to make sure I can be as supportive and helpful as possible without saying anything that will make him feel worse. I especially would like advice on what I should do when he says he feels fat. I feel pretty useless during these times cause what do I say? no you're not fat? you're a wonderful amazing person? I feel like it doesn't help at all..What I do now: I won't talk about food or his ED unless he brings it up first/wants to talk about it. I try to make him feel as comfortable and loved as possible when he is feeling depressed about having eaten or gained weight. it seems to help when I tell him that the feeling will pass and that it is ok to feel bad now because it will get better and I am with him every step of the way. There is more but this is pretty much it generally.I'm not sure if what I'm doing is good or not. He says that it helps and that it means a lot to him to know I care so much. but I'm worried about him and his health a lot. After he calms down from feeling depressed/fat and goes to bed, I am up late feeling very anxious about the future. I know he's going to get help, but I'm still scared and don't want to lose him to this. He's only going to therapy because I want him to. But I try to keep my cool because I want to be strong for him, to be someone he can feel safe with. I also worry that I'm overbearing. We both have anxiety issues, if that means anything.I would really appreciate any input you guys have, or any personal experience if you would be comfortable sharing. Thanks so much.tl;dr - My boyfriend has anorexia. He is going to get help very soon, I would like any advice on how to be supportive without being overbearing.
Hi all, My girlfriend has struggled with eating since I've known her (about one year now). She's usually been able to cope until latelyShe is very very underweight. She believes she's consuming a ridiculous amount of calories when in reality it's much lower. She's had panic attacks over eating one tiny thing. She's even started to have her hair fall out and be extremely weak.Other things that aren't an ED are talking about how she doesn't plan to be alive next year and how she self harms herself She's too young to take herself to the doctor, her mom has to be there. Usually, I wouldn't tell a parent, but Im scared for her life. I know she will probably hate me, but I know in the end this is for the best. This is the message to her mom that I have so far, but I think it kind of sucks. I need help figuring out how to really show her mom how bad it is and not sound lame."Hey again, I know you're really busy with the house situation and everything but this is really important. I love (girlfriend) more than anything and I want her to be okay, but she's not. Ever since I met her she's had trouble with her body image and eating but it's gotten very bad lately. I know about her current medical problems of not being able to keep much down, but before this happened she would throw up her food on purpose all the time. She actually has an Instagram account where she posts about trying to loose weight. Her "current goal weight" is (low weight) pounds. She actually had a panic attack when she ate one grain of rice. She told me she tried to kill herself a few days ago but she threw up the pills. She's always trying to figure out how to hurt herself weather it's cutting or hitting herself. She thinks she's fat and she's planning on starving herself, and she said she doesn't plan on being alive for next year. I know she's going to figure out I told you and I know she's going to hate me for telling you this, but she needs help. She needs professional help because Im so scared to loose her. I can show you screen shots of some things if you want, but I don't know if you want to see them. Thank you"The current medical problem was actually caused by her not eating. Not going too much into it, she had to be at the doctor a few days ago because starving herself so much made her throw everything up for a few days, but she lied to her mom about it.Thank you so much for reading
Through recovery, I’m trying to be healthier in general with my eating and my body but I’ve hit some serious road blocks.I haven’t gotten any helpful advice from fitness or health subreddits here because they only suggest calorie counting and macro counting, and that’s not something I can do with my ED history. I obsess about food every waking moment, which is worse mentally than when I’m not eating enough.I even tried food journaling both in written and picture form, but it feels useless because I don’t know if I’m eating enough or too much (both in quantity and quality).The other big thing they promote is intuitive eating, focusing on listening to your body’s cues. (Eating when you’re hungry, not when you’re not, etc). Unfortunately, I have chronic physical health issues that prevent me from feeling hungry.I’ve learned routine is important for me for planning, but that only tells me when to eat, not what. I can’t afford a nutritionist and custom diet plan. I tried the “eatthismuch” website as well (would suggest for some people), but it works best for 3 meal a day routines (i have to eat 5 small meals) and the leftovers function leaves much to be desired.I just feel like I’ve tried everything and none of it worked and now I don’t have more options. Can anyone offer advice?
A few months ago I was at a point where I barely ate or drank, which led to me passing out in public. I was mistakenly diagnosed with epilepsy because when they asked me in the ER if I could think of any reason I might have passed out and had shaky limbs, I got scared to admit I hadn't eaten and couldn't say anything. After it all happened, I knew without a doubt that the incident was due to a lack of food & dehydration. I have finally gotten an appointment with a new doctor, but I've never ever spoken to a doctor before about my problem and I'm scared to. How can I bring it up and are they going to be mad at me for not saying anything the last time? I am a 21F Canada, if that makes a difference.
I don't have Anorexia Nervosa, but I probably have Anorexia (unintentional weight loss due to under-eating). I'm currently underweight and need to gain weight for a long list of reasons. I've been to a nutritionist and I know what I should be eating, but I can't manage to eat all that food! I'm already eating several small meals a day and eating calorie dense foods, and I'm still having trouble eating enough, let alone extra.  I don't think there's any physical reason for this except a small stomach and a small appetite.For those of you who have learned how to eat full-sized meals again, what was it like? How long did it take? Any advice? Thanks!
Hi all, could really use some help with how to talk to my BFs younger sister (21)My BFs sister has always been quite thin and a picky eater. I've never been sure if she's just thin or has had disordered/restricted eating that has gone by without escalating/unnoticed. I am fully recovered from AN, btw. She recently got out of a 6 year relationship. It ended badly and has lost a bit of weight and is very underweight. I spent the weekend with my bf and his extended family, they are all quite worried but no one has said anything to her (and tbh I don't know if they would. They are debilitatingly afraid of conflict and time is crucial when it comes to EDs). My bf thinks I should talk to her because I would be an empathetic/understanding ear but I'm not sure what to say or how to approach talking to her and expressing my concern for how she is going?My only concern is it might not be an ED, it's also possible that she's just thin, and in this understandably shitty post breakup time she has lost weight so I want to be sensitive to that.Thanks 
I've had a history of eating disorders and they have largely been in remission for a few years. Through the years of recovery, I've really taken an interest in health and fitness for health and longevity reasons. I've been trying a new feeding method called time-restricted feeding, as the scientific evidence for its efficacy in circadian and metabolic regulation is quite compelling. However, I've been troubled by the fact that now, since I've been somewhat restricting my food intake due to the time limit, my obsessive tendendencies regarding food and body weight are starting to lurk back in...at the same time, I do notice the benefits of not eating so late at night, mainly I can sleep better and wake up earlier. I am at a normal body weight with a fitness level of body fat. But now I can't stop thinking about how I want to be below this normal healthy range. How do you balance striving to be healthy but not let it be a gateway to ED?
I need some tips on how to approach a bulimic roommate. I dont know her too well but I am aware of her situation (she pukes almost everyday). This may come off selfish but it is also negatively affecting my living condition since we share washrooms. I plan on talking to her but am looking for the best possible way to do it. 
Good evening mods. My name is Paul and currently I am working on a paper for my psychology class. I chose to research eating disorder in an attempt to learn more about the topic because I know very little. Someone close to me suffers from an eating disorder and I want to help them, but because I know so little it is hard to help. For the paper I am required to read about studies on the biological, social, and development causes and effects. Is there any that you would recommend? I know that I could just go out and google to find a few, but I thought I would ask you guys because I wanted to use studies that people who know more about it find useful. Thank you so much for anything that you do for me, and thank you so much for all the work you do helping the people on this subreddit.
I'm a 16 year old guy that has been struggling with disordered eating all my life. From when I was 2 I refused to eat most meats or vegetables. The only food I do like are "convenience foods" that aren't as healthy. I ended up overweight when I was 12. Needless to say I hated myself.Then I started high school. I rode my bike there everyday and skipped lunch due to my laziness. When I got home I would eat loads of less-healthy food. I lost a lot of weight. Now I was at a "healthy" weight and stayed this way for about a year and a half.Then I started restricting because I wasn't satisfied with my body. It spiraled out of control.Now I've lost a lot of weight in a month. I liked the way I looked a few pounds heavier but my mind tells me if I start eating normally I'm going to be that fat, miserable kid again.I feel like I will be teased by my siblings or my parents won't understand if I tell them. The worst part is I live in Canada where there is a huge lack of ED resources, especially for a boy.I just want someone who cares to hear what I have to say and maybe offer some help.TLDR: I'm a 16 year old boy struggling with AN who has no one to talk to about what's wrong.
Do you think small sized bruises ALL over ones legs/thighs (new ones daily) could be related to an ED/food intake?
I'm getting pretty worried about my boyfriend's 10 year old daughter. When I met her, she almost bragged about how she never ate fruit or vegetables. I shrugged it off, figuring it was an exaggeration. It isn't.In the 6 months I have known her, the only non-grain plant life I have seen pass her lips was in the form of a virgin version of a frozen drink. It's not just that, either. Foods she does like are bypassed because they aren't the "good" kind, she only likes them from restaurants, and not homemade, because she simply feels by refusing to eat them, she is gaining control, etc.When my boyfriend was still married, his ex-wife was a SAHM. Despite being an athlete, and very nutrition conscious (she might actually have orthorexia. I don't know her well enough to say) with her own choices; she never made the kids eat anything they didn't want to. They always ate different dinners from the adults and each other; primarily of their choosing; largely composed of breaded, packaged, bland ingredients. They eat a bit of a larger variety with their grandparents, and with their dad (he has them 30-40% of the time); but the 10 year old still refuses about 90% of the food offered to her. The list of things she will eat, seems to be shrinking too. The younger child might complain, and throw some tantrums, but will eventually eat at least a small portion of about 65-70% of what she is offered. I feel this is pretty normal for a 7 year old.I am not trying to blame this on just his ex wife. I feel both my boyfriend and his ex-wife have let this go too far; and are being too lax about it. They are writing it off as picky eating; and maybe it was at a point; but I think it goes beyond that.I can't imagine how it feels to watch your family fall apart (the separation was 2ish years ago, with little warning). I imagine some hope was held out until the divorce was actually signed (about a year ago). I imagine watching one parent move on (by starting to see me seriously) added to that stress. In that way, I am responsible too.I realize that a lot of times food is a tool of control and comfort; especially for younger children, who feel like they don't have control over much else (I think this is the same reason she refuses to wear deodorant). I might just be overreacting, but I'm starting to be afraid for her well being. Her dad told her she couldn't have dessert last night unless she ate one bite of a butter soaked green bean. The reaction was akin to what I saw the last time I saw my friend's parents try to get her to eat one bite of a meal, before they had to hospitalize her for anorexia. It was despair, fear, helplessness... It was like eating this one bite of a veggie she had never even tried, and had no way of knowing she didn't like, would kill her.Am I overreacting here? I get along really well with his kids. They seem to trust me a lot. I don't want to destroy that trust and affection by needlessly pushing this. I know my boyfriend is taking my concerns to heart (hence him trying to get her to eat a green bean). At the same time, I understand his fear: She's eating enough calories. He's afraid that if we make too big a deal out of this, we'll turn what is maybe just a phase into a disorder.I've only ever seen eating disorders from the outside. My mom had one. A few friends of mine have had a really rough go of it. I've been lucky enough never to get there. I'd really like to hear some perspective on this situation from people who have more knowledge in this realm.Thank you.
I had anorexia for about 5 years, but was never hospitalized or officially diagnosed. I definitely had a terrible relationship with food and exercise, though, and had a lot of the tell-tale physical signs of anorexia: severe acne and scarring, hair loss, always feeling cold, terrible nails, bloating, constipation etc etc.Now, I've been in recovery for 11 months, and am completely weight restored. It's been really tough accepting my new body, though, because all the weight has gone to my stomach, butt and face. I've read that the weight redistributes, but it's been such a long time, I don't think it will. I've started doing light exercises in my own home, like planks, squats, push ups and lunges, just to tone up a bit... but I often get really lightheaded and need to lie down.The thing is, I've seen multiple doctors who've tested my blood pressure, heart rate, listened to my breathing, etc.... and they all said I'm fine. Should I stop doing these exercises? Or is this normal?
I have been taking prescription Adderall for two years for my adult ADHD, and a well-known side-effect of the drug is weight loss due to a suppressed appetite. The problem is that I have been diagnosed with anorexia and have suffered with it on and off for nine years (I lost a lot of weight purposely in 2014 when I got on Adderall for the first time. My anorexia was the worst it'd ever been). Sometimes I take more than my prescribed daily dose if I'm craving fatty food (like two weeks to a week before my period) resulting in me finishing my monthly bottle of pills a week to sometimes two weeks early. When I run out of Adderall, my appetite kicks back in at full force which results in me binging everyday until I can finally get my pills for the next month, and thus gaining a shit ton of weight/retaining lots of water weight. How do I stop this?!?! This is not healthy and it's honestly scaring me what this rapid weight gain (even if some of it is water retention) could be doing to my insides.
I currently am a healthy weight, although I am unhappy with my body. I honestly believe that I would be happier if I was just a little bit leaner, but as I have had a history with restricting/purging, years ago I decided I was not "allowed" to try to lose fat. Well recently I decided I was in a healthy enough place to try again. I started counting calories and weighing myself daily. I totally fixated on it. All I could think about food. I also have no idea how many calories I need per day because I exercise a lot, so I think I was tending to way under eat, and then I was starving, but I couldn't tell because I'm not in touch with my body and can't tell when I'm hungry. So then I would binge on junk food because I felt like a failure. And then I would severely restrict the next day to make up for it. Starve, binge, restrict, repeat. Am I ever allowed to try to get leaner? I also want to love myself no matter what shape I am, but it seems like I should be allowed to make what I perceive to be a minor change? I run ~5 days/week, and sometimes I struggle with which workouts to do because some workouts will make me stronger and faster, while others will burn more calories. I have started telling myself "I would rather be strong than pretty," but that makes me sad too.I wish someone would just tell me what I need to do to get better. I've tried flooding myself with body positive blogs/instagrams/etc. but I just don't really believe it. I can't tell that it helps at all. On one hand I feel like if I was a little bit leaner, I really would be happier. I don't think I'm the type of person who would just keep going and keep going. I know this because when I am slightly leaner, I actually am happier with what I see in the mirror. On the other hand, I feel like I am a bad feminist for not just sucking it up and loving myself the way I am, but I honestly don't know how to. I don't understand why this is so hard.
It seems like most of the questions are about support or knowing if they are, but when I hear someone is recovering from an ED, I'm not sure exactly what is going on behind the scenes. What are they changing? How do they get rid of the constant fear of overeating and the desire to push their bodies to lower and lower amounts? What steps do they take to stop obsessive tendencies like meticulously counting every calorie and weighing what little food they eat without being overcome with the fear that they're overeating? My girlfriend becomes uneasy at just the idea of her counts being underestimated, so how do you guys make it easier? I've searched coping methods and they all sounds pretty useless. One was "take a bath!". Thats not going to help surpass immense fear of overeating. 
Hi there, I've been dating a girl who I believe has A.N. She has every one of the classic symptoms. But of course she is in complete denial and believes she is fine. It was a bit of breaking point for me today because she had all the symptoms of a severe low blood sugar (i'm a type 1 diabetic so i'm familiar) but she kept refusing to eat or drink anything. Finally she had a little orange juice after a big battle.I've never told her straight out that I think she has an ED. I'm not sure how to approach this. Thank you 
With Thanksgiving coming up tomorrow and Christmas, Hanukkah, and New Year's around the corner, I thought it might be helpful to start a holiday survival tips thread. What helps you to have a happy and balanced holiday season? Do you have any recommendations for others with eating disorders to enjoy a binge-free, purge-free, restriction-free, and overall behavior-free time? What helps you to focus on the company of your family and friends instead of food, exercise, and body-image? How do you deal with negative comments from that one pesky aunt? How do you avoid going on a food rampage at the company holiday party? Or avoid the stress of eating around other people? ...you get the idea. I'd love to hear what helps others and share what helps me!
I am well versed with most mental health issues, because of my own issues and i am studying counselling. However, supporting a friend with anorexia is something that i don't know much about. I am also overweight, and I feel worried that this might complicate matters.My friend talks about her eating disorder, but other than showing unconditional support and empathy, i am at a loss. There are times she will have difficulties eating. Is it better for me to not bring attention to it or gently encourage her? or is that something that varies from person to person.
Hello, I am a 20F. I've been having sporadic episodes of disordered eating for years now. By that I mean that I can spend months not worrying at all about my weight and caloric intake, and then suddenly start seeing myself as not skinny enough, and consequently restricting. This usually lasts for a couple of months, then I go back to normal. For the record, I've always been underweight, even when getting an healthy caloric intake. But since last spring, when a close relative of mine was diagnosed with a pretty severe ED, my relationship with food and body image has gotten worse. I spent 4 months restricting , then 1 eating more or less normally (not eating really much, but not extremely restricting either), and now a couple of weeks ago I started restricting again, and way worse than I've ever done. It has gotten to the point that I constantly feel dizzy, my hair is getting thinner and thinner and has started falling out, my skin is dry, I am anxious and depressed all the time, and occasionally paranoid. I have troubles concentrating and my academics results have greatly suffered from this. I recognize this is obviously getting out of hand, but I can't stop. It started as a way to be in control, but now I am beginning to realise that I am not in control anymore. I recognize I may need external help to get out of this before it gets even worse, but I have no idea of how to ask for help. I am afraid to tell my mother (who is the person I trust more than anyone) because I don't want to hurt her and scare her. If I told her, I'd have to tell her about my issues with self harm too, And that would really be hard on her. I know she would feel responsible for my state, even if she has absolutely no fault in it. I don't want my father to know, because honestly he's one of the reasons for my ED. I don't want my sick close relative to know, because I know how competitive EDs are, and she's already having an hard time recovering without me adding to it. Furthermore, since her illness was the "trigger" for my own to spiral out of control, I don't want her to feel... guilty. I am scared. I don't know what to do. Any advice would be immensely helpful at this point. This is the first time I write in this sub, so I don't know if I did it correctly. If not, I apologize
I'm currently going through a really tough time with a relapse. I've been struggling with my ED since I was an obese child, I've had diagnoses of bulimia and OSFED (atypical anorexia). I'm 22, have spent two years actively acknowledgeding I have a problem, I was in treatment but the services available to me aren't great, and I was also in an abusive home. Fast track to now, I live elsewhere and am in a better position for recovery due to lack of negative comments and abuse from my family. However, I relapsed, big time. This is making my relationship really hard and also my friendships. I've been invited to countless things in the past month, at least 4 or 5 a week. I've only gone to maybe two things this whole month, I can barely spend time with anyone if it involves food or alcohol. I feel comfortable eating only with my boyfriend, no one else. However it's making my relationship bad now too because my sex drive is just completely gone, I also have endometriosis and have started a new antidepressant, but I used to at least feel some desire. I feel like a blank, robot. I just, I don't know. I care about my boyfriend but find it so hard to be with him because I hate being touched and looked at. I don't like anyone looking at me and it puts me off even going to class. I've been avoiding social eating because it makes me feel violently angry after I've eaten, I don't purge anymore but the thought is still there and I end up wanting to hurt myself instead,i haven't but it's horrible enough. I'm in more psychological pain than I have been in a long time. My problem is that I know this is destroying everything. I have started feeling dizzy, weak, and faint too. But the weight loss encourages me. My doctor gave me bloods to get done but I'm putting it off because in scared there won't be anything wrong with me. I'm still overweight and no one ever takes me seriously about the ED. I don't know how to want to get better. What can I do to make this easier? Why am I destroying myself?? I have this stupid idea that I will feel better in x amount of kg and then I can get help, reality is I won't, and also I probably won't get there. But it's driving me. Im scared of getting worse because I live alone, but I don't know how to want to get better, I don't know how to even approach recovery again. It was so so hard last time. Please, any advice would be so appreciated. 
So my girlfriend and I met after the summer because I was out of state and she got hired at the place where I worked. One day she asks if I can cover her because she's been sick for a while and doesn't feel well so I say sure. A few shifts after she was in the back eating food and spitting it into a cup which I guessed was because she didn't want to upset or stomach and gave her some space to do so. Flash forward to later, I left the store but liked her so we start dating but after the first date she tells me that she has an ed. Apparently over the summer she started throwing up every time she would eat (not purging, her body would just reject it) and would cry, try to eat, work, sleep, repeat all summer. She now can only eat pancakes, drink ensure, and eat fried eggs without the yolk. She's so terrified to try to eat anything other than that because she doesn't want to throw up and now she lost a substantial amount of weight over the summer and if she goes further I don't know what to do. We have an English teacher who really inspires her and she confided in her and the teacher told her that she used to be bulimic so I thought that would help her a lot. It really just ended up helping her a little but also making her feel weird because she feels like her problem doesn't match that of our teacher's. She told me that she feels isolated in this because she hasn't been able to find anyone that has the same problem so she doesn't have anyone to show her the grass is greener. Can anyone here tell me how to help her? I really wish I could but all I feel like I can do is tell her to keep moving forward and reassure her that it will be alright. 
I've suffered from Binge Eating for a number of years now, with each year getting more severe than the last. On Monday of next week I have an intake appointment at a treatment center and it's very likely that they'll recommend inpatient treatment. What do I say? He has noticed some of my binges in the last few months but he knows that I'm self-conscious about food and my weight so he's never really said anything. 
Help with struggling to eat and recovery...I'm a 30f who's been suffering on and off from bulimia and anorexia for 10 years now. I've recently started a relationship with the most wonderful man. He wants me to be healthy, supports and helps me, and for the first time in a while I truly want to fully recover.However, I'm having difficultly keeping with my meal plans. Last night I simple couldn't eat dinner and I've noticed the water retention in my body completely freaks me out. I was wondering for any tips to keep with meals, not skipping and dealing with the negative thoughts coming from the symptoms of recovery.Thank you.
I've had issues with eating in the past but have been fine for the past 2 years. Recently I've started strength training and because of this I'd like to be able to track how much protein I'm eating daily, and because of various allergies I need to make sure I'm getting enough iron, vitamins, etc for my health. It was calorie counting and those apps in general that took me from wanting to loose a few pounds to spiraling out of control, and while I consider myself 100% recovered I know that if I start calorie counting again things will start to slide. Does anyone know of any apps that you can track your eating and it will tell you your daily grams of protein, fat, carbs, vitamins but WON'T show you the calorie intake? Thanks so very much
I've been struggling with my eating disorder for about 7 years. For all of that time, including the months I was in-treatment, I have abused laxatives. I haven't grown fully dependent on them, so medically speaking I could stop if I had to; not sure ED would be too happy about that though. Long story short, I started noticing that I wasn't feeling anything when I went to wipe or that it felt like a heavy weight was on my bottom. I began having to go to the bathroom when I had literally nothing in my system, and it never felt like my bowels were empty. One day, I grew curious and took a picture; I was horrified at what I found and realized I probably had an anal prolapse for years now. Has anyone had to deal with this before as a result of their eating disorder? It really is killing my self-esteem and I can't bring myself to tell my family I have yet another problem medically because of this. When you look it up, it typically only ever happens to elderly people. I don't know what to do. I was hoping someone else understands what it's been like.
Hello,In the beginning of 2016, I started a medicine named Zyprexa to treat psychotic depression. One of its side effects is weight gain. I maintained my old eating habits while taking this medicine (aka barely eating), and I ended up gaining weight enough to go from underweight to healthy weight. My doctor was happy I was finally normal, but gaining weight made me so upset that taking Zyprexa made me suicidal. So, I stopped taking it in September. I was supposed to see my psychiatrist about starting a new medicine but it didn't happen because he really wanted me to stay on Zyprexa despite how it made me feel.In October I experienced a loss that made me very depressed. I started starving myself and I didn't get up from bed aside to go to the bathroom. I barely ate at all (I've only ever done this once in my life when I was suicidal enough that cops had to be called to my college to take me to the hospital). My eating habits got bad enough that I went to my doctor to get advice. She said I wasn't "seriously sick" since I was at a healthy weight, though it is kind of close to underweight. She then told me in order to help me, I had to help myself first and eat. This really bothers me because for a month of barely eating, I should have lost enough weight to be underweight. I actually did lose weight, but not much. The Zyprexa has changed the way my body is and makes it very hard to lose weight. I can't exercise it away due to some health conditions. And also, I just cannot eat normally. I don't understand the reasoning behind it, but when I'm depressed more than usual, eating makes me feel bad enough to want to self-harm, and I only eat when I'm feeling very weak,  or if I need to leave the house.My question is, what do I do? If it's not serious enough to get help, should I wait until it is? I can't tell when it's serious. I feel sick and weak, the same way I felt before I was hospitalized in 2014, and yet my weight is normal and healthy for my height.Also, how do people get better without a support group? I can't see my psychiatrist or my doctor until January, and I'm very short on cash so I can't see my therapist. Family is out of the question since they disregard anything that's wrong with me and we don't talk despite living in the same house. I'm 19 by the way. Sorry if this is confusing, I'm in an odd mental state right now.
Here is my question to the community: I have been struggling with an eating disorder for the past 8 years. I am working with doctors and psychologists in order to get better. I just recently got together with my [22F] boyfriend [23M]. We have been together about a month and have gotten very close in that month. I have told him about my issues with binge eating and bulimia, but I feel as though I'm not explaining myself very well. He has been nothing but great and supportive, and has even offered to come to an appointment at my psychologists with me. I feel very lucky to have found him.I have been having a very difficult time these past two weeks but I don't know how/if I should tell him. Although I have told him about my issues, I don't think He really gets the extent to which I am suffering. I don't want to scare him off, but at the same time I don't want to lie to him and say that everything is fine (which I kind of have been doing). My eating disorder is very complex (which most of them are) and so I don't really know where to begin explaining things to him. I think a big part of it is that I'm embarrassed about my ED, even though I know I shouldn't be. I've basically been holed up in my bedroom for the past two days doing nothing, and I haven't told him that. I get embarrassed talking about it with anyone.I have ruined all of my past relationships because of my issues, but this guy is very special and I don't want to ruin it this time. I want to make it work. If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated!
Evening folks,My girlfriend struggled with bulimia/purging disorder earlier this year. After a several tough months, she gradually improved to the point where she stopped purging completely. Since then, she has been doing very well and eats normally. However, she still shows signs of being affected by the experience and I am still worried for her well being.The main problem, as I see it, is her low self esteem and a less than positive body image. I've been trying to boost both, but we have for a few months now engaged in a long distance relationship, so I don't feel like I can support her as much as I did before. It also seems that I, besides herself, am the only person still concerned with it.I've noticed that her thoughts start to revert to the old pattern when she is in a period of great stress, or has been unable to exercise due to illness or lack of time. At social events, she feels guilty both when eating a piece of cake and when refraining to do so. However, my girlfriend seems to force herself to eat it, due to it being "normal", rather than to enjoy it. Although I do not want to admit it, I am concerned that she might relapse or come near a relapse in the future.I am aware of the fact that a complete recovery is a long process. However, there is much more material on the web regarding the support of someone with an "active" eating disorder, than there is on supporting someone who has struggled from it previously. Thus, I'm in the need for some advice.Should we try to get her a second appointment at a psychiatrist? She has only had one before. Although she is unsure on that point, I don't see the harm in being careful and playing it safe. Any opinions on this? I'm also trying to find a book (not on the self help format) to raise her self esteem.
My name is Evette, and I'm the senior news and identity editor at Revelist, a site for millennial women.I am currently working on a story about male eating disorder survivors sharing the one thing they want everybody to know about what it's like. If you are a male survivor of an eating disorder, and you would be willing to participate, you should contact me a contact me at edionne@revelist.com. The interview can be anonymous. I'll need to know your age, how long you've had/used to have an eating disorder, and one thing you wish people knew about what it's like to have an eating disorder as a man. 
First some information about me:I used to have an eating disorder but I managed to overcome it. I still struggle with feeling guilty after eating too much and sometimes I really feel disgusted about my body, but that's all there is to it. I cook healthy food for me each day and I eat at least 3 times per day. I do sports and live pretty healthy indeed.However my gf is very very thin, to the point I'm afraid of "breaking" her when I hug her. I had thought that's just like she is, but in fact she rarely eats anything and when I ask her if she had breakfast she always tells me that she already had tea which counts as a meal in her opinion. I try to cook as often as I can for her but I can't do that every day and often she just refuses to eat because "she already had lunch"She often feels weak in my arms and her heartbeat is racing like crazyI'm so afraid ><And I don't know what to do
I already have a low sex drive because of some unknown issue, but lately I've felt extremely disgusting because of the way I look (after accidentally gaining weight--I was in the healthy range a couple years after recovery and okay with it, but now I'm slightly overweight although no one else sees that... but the numbers are there) and it's made my sex drive go from low to just nothing. At all.It's very distressing for me and my fiance. Do I just force myself to do it? I've refused to take my shirt off in front of him for months now, and just keeping my stomach covered isn't helping. I think I've just stopped seeing myself as a sexual being. Like, to think about myself having sex actively turns me off.
Over the past year a friend of mine's girlfriend has lost a significant amount of weight. She was at a healthy weight before but now is significantly smaller, to the point that me and a few of my other friends worry about her having an eating disorder. I know its bad to make assumptions, but we are worried for her. How can we help her?
Lately I feel like I've either been bingeing or restricting and I cannot escape the cycle. Does anyone have some good distractions or coping skills I can use to keep myself on track? The trouble, I think, is mindlessness...I know I need to be more present. Anything that could help me achieve this? I'm kinda desperate and in a time crunch, so any answers would be much appreciated.
I don't know where to start, so this might be a little ramble-y. I am 18, almost 19 years old, and the girl in question is 19. She has been diagnosed with anorexia for many years, even going inpatient for 7 months (iirc). I have only known her for a couple of months. We immediately got along really well, and now both acknowledge that we like each other a lot, but just aren't ready to rush into an actual relationship just yet. A little while back she decided to tell me about her ED. I honestly had begun having suspicions, as she had never eaten in front of me, and she would constantly talk about loving food. Like most people, I had no idea what anorexia really did to you. Since she told me, I have read countless articles, posts, anything I can to try to understand what it is that she suffers with, and how to best help her. She told me that I would never know how helpful I am and how much I mean to her just by doing what I am, and by saying the things to her that I am (which I admit, are mostly word for word what I have read is good to say to people suffering from the disease)The other day she went to the doctor, and she wouldn't tell me what her doctor said when she got back. She's been pretty open with what's going on, but these past few days she has done a 180 and is now saying that she wants to do what she wants, and that it isn't hurting me so I shouldn't be worried. It's none of my business, she says.Obviously, that seems like a pretty good clue that things are pretty bad. Not only that, but she has recently been wearing looser and looser clothing, constantly degrading how she looks, and has been misinterpreting things I say and twisting them to make it seem like I am judging her. For example, we went shopping the other day, and she told me that the tights she got were too big, but she liked them anyway and got them. She wore them the next day, and I accidentally mentioned that they weren't big, and they looked great! I have been very purposeful to not mention things like that, but it slipped. She got offended and thought I was calling her fat. From what I have read, these are all things that are common for someone with anorexia who is relapsing. Last night I asked about it again, and we had a long conversation with many tears where she basically told me that she wouldn't blame me if I left her, because she doesn't want to hurt me, and everyone else in her life has left her before too. She made sure to say that many times, and that she wouldn't be offended at all, as she knows she is a pain and shouldn't have to be dealt with by other people. I told her that I chose her, and that I didn't care what others had done.So here is where it gets a little more complicated. She told me one day that she has an instagram account where she posts food pics and talks about her eating disorder. She said the people following her have been basically the most helpful people she has ever had in her life, because they are constantly encouraging each other to fight, etc. One day she gave me her phone to play music, and she got a notification for that account. I did not immediately look at it, as I know it is private and I wanted her to tell me about if only if she wanted to. However, worry got the best of me today, and I looked at it. Her latest post was her telling everyone that things were bad. Very bad. Apparently her doctor had told her that if she didn't schedule to go inpatient before the end of December, she wasn't going to see her anymore. She went on to say that that was fine by her, and that she didn't even think she was doing bad enough to go back yet.Reddit, what can I do? What should I do? How can I help? Can I help at all? I am at a loss, I am clueless as to what to do. I know a lot of other stuff about her ED that I can answer any questions about if I missed something that is important for advice. Thank you guys so much.
I care a lot about my roommate and his girlfriend, but his girlfriend is anorexic to the point that it is affecting their relationship and her health. She is becoming irritable and is lashing out at him about petty things, which my roommate, being a sensitive soul, isn't taking to well. She is also constantly complaining about headaches, stomach aches, and the other day nearly collapsed from exhaustion after just a couple hours of standing. He's tried to personally approach her about it, but she denies it is a problem, and it simply keeps getting worse and worse. Is the best course of action to force her in some way to seek help? We thought that telling her RA (we're in college) would be a good first step, but we're honestly just lost and worried. We're scared that trying to be supportive of her is going to just let her get sicker and sicker, but we don't want to be too forceful either. Please help!
Hey,  I was hoping to get some advice from the community about my new roommate who I suspect is suffering with bulimia and I am really stuck how to handle it. Background: my flatmate takes 2-3 showers per day, which always begin with the bath taps running and really loud music. I can hear coughing, spitting and occasionally retching (but I often wonder if thats in my head). After around 5-10 minutes, the toilet flushes, shower goes on and the air freshener goes off. Now at first I thought she was maybe just self-conscious of pooping, but it's the routine of it which gives me the feeling things aren't quite right. She never buys any unhealthy food and really doesn't ever have a lot of food in, however if I buy anything remotely unhealthy it won't last more than a day. If I ask her to replace the missing food she gets really upset like she's about to cry and I feel like I have to ask in a really non-accusatory way so she doesn't flip out. She's ill all the time, with colds/flu and her skin is  dull and pale.I don't know how to handle this situation and this sounds really, really horribly selfish of me but I find this mentally draining. I have a history with eating disorders, specifically bulimia, and when I hear her purge (or what I suspect) it brings up a lot of bad memories, which although I am semi in recovery, is really difficult to be around. I am in my final 2 months of my masters degree and cannot afford to mess it up, having taken a lot of time off for mental health reason and at last I am in the final straight. I have a big deadline in a few days but even now I am so worried and distracted about what to do I can't concentrate.This all sounds very self centred of me and I feel sad that someone else is going through it and I don't know how to help. If I speak to her she might resent me for it and life in the flat will be very uncomfortable or potentially she could ask me to leave (she owns the apartment). Or she might become emotionally reliant on me, which I just don't think I have the capacity to handle right now, as bad as it sounds. Alternatively, I considered speaking to her sister or close friends, but I don't know if again she will feel betrayed. I feel very guilty that I can't help her and feel pretty helpless. Equally I wonder if I made this all up in my head, but I think instinct is quite important in judging matters like this.Any advice would be hugely appreciated right now!
Hi, I'm writing to you guys because I need help.I recently got together with my girlfriend, and she has had a history with bulimia and anorexia. I really enjoy looking at her eating because she looks really happy, but after our meals, she would say things like how she feels disgusted at herself since she eats so much.I'm really distressed and don't know how to go around helping her. I'm already constantly reaffirming her that her weight and her figure is fine, but she seems to be accepting it as a way to make me feel like I'm helping.What advice can you guys provide for me? I'm sorry if I'm asking questions that can be answered easily but I couldn't find anything pertaining to my situation. However, I'll still be searching.Hope you guys can help me, thanks a lot:)The OP, /u/rollingon2, has requested to have their username added so you can PM if you wish.
I've been struggling with what started out as a very restrictive diet at the end of college and beginning of law school, but am now stuck in a period of overexercise to compensate for all the food I eat. I feel like I'm ready for my next step of recovery but am still having some issues actually "pulling the trigger" and trying to balance my calories in/calories out as opposed to burn more calories than my estimated intake each day.One of the things I'm struggling with is that I really enjoy eating out on the weekends but am afraid that I will not enjoy it anymore if I am unable to "work it off" through exercise during the week. **Does anyone have any tips for how to manage this in the real world?** Haven't let go of that pathological worry of gaining weight.That being said, I recently (aka, past few weeks) have seen a large uptick and the scale despite being relatively careful about my diet. Has anyone experienced weight gain despite restriction--or, perhaps, because of it? I have some thoughts that perhaps my body is hurting and is for some reason holding on to extra pounds in the form of water/something else because it fears starvation? I ask not because I feel like I need to lose anything, but because I think understanding what's going on with my body or feeling like eating and exercising ini a more balanced fashion may be more motivating that way...In any case, thanks everyone!
I know recovery is all about giving up rules, and "normal eating" is all about being flexible.But I'm really worried about my intake because my insurance doesn't cover any form of treatment, and I'm trying to navigate the physical aspects of recovery on my own. Like many of us in recovery, I've rediscovered many foods I forgot I loved. One of these is scrambled eggs (with a little cheese) on buttered sourdough toast. I eat it every day, since it's cheap and I like it.My other meals have lots of variety -- pizza, salad, fruit, etc etc... But is it abnormal to eat the same meal for breakfast every day? I realize this question might sound stupid to some, but I honestly don't know what 'normal' eating looks like anymore, so I'm looking for some perspective.
I posted to r/EatingDisorders earlier this year with a general timeline and list of symptoms asking if it were possible if it sounded like ED behaviour. After discussion with my GP, she expressed concern about the bingeing and over-exercising but doesn't want to label it as an ED yet.She gave me a referral for a dietitian who specialises in weight loss and EDs. So far she has been so positive and while I find myself questioning some of the choices she made on my food plan, at this stage I'm trying to trust her judgement.My GP advised me to tell my psychiatrist also, referred to as P. P knows that I have ongoing weight issues (she raised my seroquel and prescribed effexor and valdoxan). But I've never said anything about previous or current bingeing/over-exercising concerns. I started off by describing what the dietitian was like and the overall plan - when I mentioned that breakfast was cereal P stated that it was too full of carbs and stated I should drink milk. When I mentioned eating every 3 hours, she said it was just a common dietitan tactic. I got as far as saying 'I have to tell you something', before she started talking about her morning routine with milk involved. Afterwards I didn't think I could tell her; maybe she would think my concern over my ED behaviours were an excuse to get out of diet and exercise? I was so panicked I went mute and we had to finish the session.I called in sick for the next two sessions. I was anxious and didn't know what to say. This morning I went in and 1) missed the first 5 minutes because I was too anxious to go in and 2) when I did go in, went mute again. P's response was to threaten to send me someone else (which I expected - I have such a hard time trusting medical staff because either they screw up or they give up). I got upset, wrote down that I should have expected it and thanks for proving me right, then swore at her and left. Called my girlfriend, who talked me down and convinced me to go back in and talk with her.Attempted to try and talk with P, but things got heated and I started yelling when I mentioned the milk. She called me abusive. Then she commented that I must be like that with other medical staff if I feel I should have expected it. She mentioned that I cost her a $1000 by not showing up to the previous sessions and threatened me several times more with writing a letter to my GP and firing me after stating that I do no work in the sessions.This all just broke me. I honestly didn't think we had that much of a problem. And I still never even got to talk about my ED issues, which upsets me.I just don't know what to do now. Can anyone help?

I've been recovering from AN-b/p for several years now. For the past few years, I've maintained a slightly underweight BMI, and I've gotten used to the idea of staying there. Recently, however, my weight has been trending slightly upwards. I am now maintaining a lower-range, but technically healthy, BMI. I feel like it should not be a huge deal, but I just do not know how to cope. I know that I need to accept where my body goes naturally, but I'm struggling with intense urges to both restrict and binge. Does anyone have tips for accepting a healthy body weight, dealing with weight gain, or working on body image distortions? I am afraid I will slip into old behaviors if I can't get a better handle on this soon. :(
Disclaimer:I'm under 18 and male (not sure if that will help with my question)I want to keep this short. For the last 6 months I've been obsessed with my body image and trying to lose weight. However I've started to vomit half of what I eat. It started around two weeks ago and now I've only realised this isn't normal. I've started to become more tired and lose more energy (not sure if that's a side effect of having bulimia) and I am worried about my health. Even now as I am writing have the urge to eat a lot but I don't want to for fear of vomiting. I can eat normal meals, but it's when I eat any snacks outside my meals, I vomit them up.How do I stop myself? Is there anyway I can stop myself binge eating, and therefore lose the feeling to vomit what I eat.
I think my little sister (11 y/o) might be showing some early signs of disordered eating habits. As her role model/someone she looks up to, is there anything I can do to prevent it from getting any worse?
I'm having a really hard time in recovery lately. Despite eating better and working out, I am still overweight. I am trying to not focus on my size, but it is so hard when I can't even shop in stores I like because I am too large for all of their sizes. All I want is to be the size I was before I started with this eating disorder... Does anyone have any kind words? Or even advice on how to get my metabolism back to normal? Or on how to eat properly? I left residential in July and don't have a nutritionist; the one there simply focused on intuitive eating and our chef made everything as she instructed, but the nutritionist never told me how to balance meals on my own or anything...
I'm struggling to recover from anorexia. I live in Milwaukee Wisconsin, if that's relevant. I have some form of Obamacare, so I don't have mental health coverage, and I can't see a nutritionist without a diagnosis, which I can't get now that I'm weight restored and eating adequately.Are there any other options for someone like me? I've been getting 100% of my information for recovery through the internet, which is okay, but I feel so alone in this. I have so many questions about my body and am always on the point of relapse. I really need a therapist, or at least some sort of guidance aside from my general doctor, who isn't an ED specialist.Is there anything? Or am I screwed
Apologies if this was asked already (I searched and couldn't find anything): Does anyone have personal recommendations for Residential Treatment centers for eating disorders? Everyone's websites make things look good, but I am curious what others have to say about personal experiences, either from yourself, a friend, loved one, etc.Thank you!

I am currently in an intensive outpatient setting, and have been for a little over four weeks (not including a week of hospitalization). I reached a healthy weight just today, and have currently been overeating (calorie prescription to gain weight - if this is important to know, it's over the "minimum recovery guidelines" that I have seen floating around online). I have been gaining at a steady rate even at levels before my calorie prescription, but they have been increasing it anyway to meet the weekly requirement of weight gain. However, my treatment team is saying that if I maintain over the weekend (the program is weekdays, and during the weekend we are at home), they will increase my calories again so that I will gain more. I've been struggling to accept "set point theory" and trusting my body, but this is kind of messing with me. If I am eating above "recovery guidelines" and maintain at a healthy weight, wouldn't that mean that I have reached my 'set point'? Why would they need to increase the prescription?
I have childhood hunger based BED. My biggest trigger is how -painful- my hunger gets. I'll eat and eat to not feel the awful pain of it. I can identify normal hunger, and when I'm too hungry, nausea, and this feeling is next in line. Is this just related to hunger hormones? Should I see a doctor or a therapist?
I have been thinking on this for MONTHS, and finally want to just toss out everything going on in my head to those who may understand and have some suggestions.I was first hospitalized inpatient for anorexia at age 11. I went inpatient again at 15, 19, and 23. The 23 was the kicker because that pulled me out of a job and it was VERY hard to get back into a career again afterwards, strained my relationship with my husband (who was also dating me when I went in at 19), and caused all sorts of life pain.I am now 36. I relapsed 2 years after the last inpatient visit and haven't rebounded since. I am at an unhealthy weight and have been there for quite some time. (no numbers). I have not just established myself in a new career, but have advanced highly in it, have two kids, and a lot more responsibility than I ever have. In other words, I feel as though I can't just leave this time to do any inpatient, residential, or partial programs without risk of losing the position that is paying the rent and bills, losing my husband, and being away from my children.One week ago, I have my yearly physical. All the bloodwork, EKGs, tests came back positive. Healthy. Normal. Except the doctor warned me I was a ticking time bomb. And I get that. But I am also trying to logically think how this would play out if I "went anywhere" to "get help." How would I pay the bills without a job? Not just medical bills, how will I keep up on rent if I just leave? Can I, do I, should I really walk away from where I am good at what I do and highly respected for it? Everyone says "well if that's the case, then gain the weight yourself." It's not like this is my first rodeo, that I don't know WHAT to do- that I just "want to run to a safe haven and not take responsibility." I do as much as I can, I push it, but then get to that tough point, that part where it's so hard to push through on your own, where you need an extra push for more than just a half hour chat- a good month-long push to not just go through it with, but to CONTINUE through with it until it no longer seems as foreign. But can't I just do that myself? "Come on, think of reasons."In a way, I want to get help. Finally kick this damned thing and be free of it. But in a way, what's that help really going to do or look like? As I said, I've already been in treatment centers 4 times in my life- 3 different treatment centers, and I still ended up relapsing. What would be any different? How would it all work out so I'm not jobless, with a divorce, sharing custody of my kids, maybe even homeless? What treatment centers are even our there that are any good?Sorry for the rambling, but these have all been things going on in my head for the longest time and I just needed to vent them out in a safe place. I am in no immediate danger, but there's also nothing healthy about maintaining what I'm doing. There's no easy answer. There's no straight up "easy answer." I'm not expecting that. Just any input. Ideas. Suggestions. Or just a safe place to let this all out.Thanks everyone!
I have been working very hard on overcoming my eating disorder (EDNOS) lately. One thing that I haven't been able to fix yet is not letting other's eating affect me. For example, recently at my boyfriend's family gathering, watching everyone overeat around me almost gave me an anxiety attack. This is probably because now I am VERY mindful of only eating until I am full and eating slowly.In general, my boyfriend triggers me a lot, either by him eating really quickly, or breaking the "rules" I had set for myself when I was deep in the disorder.This is really the one thing that seems to be preventing my recovery the most--when I see other people eat in certain ways and situations, it makes me want to purge almost immediately. Does anyone have any ideas as to how to work on this? I don't want to be so affected by others and I want to be able to enjoy parties and family gatherings more.
Hey! I'm doing my university dissertation about eating disorders due to my own battle with one, i'm playing catch up as I was in hospital over my ED all summer and would like to share the survey in the subreddit (it has no images, no mentions of specific weights, no numbers about weight etc and has international helplines on final page)https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/PXBDRQR
My girlfriend has bulimia and refuses to get help. She seems to be getting worse and I wondered if anyone had advice for how I should help
I've struggled with poor body image for a long time. I've always felt ugly and gross. It isn't just my weight, but my face, acne, and teeth as well. But, well, for the purposes of this post, I'm wondering if it is just poor self esteem or if I actually have an eating disorder. While I'm not actively starving myself or checking for calories, I always feel fat or overweight; whenever I look at my body I pinch my stomach and breasts to check for excess fat and am absolutely horrified if I have any fat that pokes out over my underwear (ie "mushroom top"). I go through periods where I exercise religiously and try to make sure I only eat a very low number of calories a day. I weigh myself nearly everyday and always feel ashamed when I look at the scale. I don't typically let it rule my life and often don't really think about it, but whenever I am in the shower or changing clothes - and sometimes when I eat too, I guess - I feel deeply ashamed of my appearance."Do I have an eating disorder? Can anyone offer advice?
Well, I'm mostly looking for help on how I can be as helpful as possible regarding my friend. She has told me she has issues with seeing herself as overweight, despite being (previously, at least) at a healthy weight. She has recently lost a significant amount of weight, bordering on being dangerous if it goes much farther. She is involved in gymnastics, which takes up a significant portion of her day, every day. She has told me that she has bulimic tendencies, and it doesn't help that she has a gastrointestinal issue which makes eating painful. Right now she has told me she has set a target ( which I don't know exactly ), but I can't imagine it's good, on top of the already significant weight she has dropped in recent months. She has said that she doesn't need help / does not want treatment, and has told me not to tell anyone; I will not unless it becomes very necessary as it will cost the friendship, I'm sure. She also has trust issues (ie believes people will become her friend to find out about her and ruin her life), and I'd prefer not to reinforce that notion, unless, again, it is absolutely necessary. Further compounding the issue is that she is mostly a online friend, meaning I see her very little to not at all for extended periods. We are also minors, if that means anything. I'd like to know what I can do, if anything, to help her given the complex circumstances. I'm very concerned for her.
Hi, I have struggled with BED since last year and it is ruining my life. I grew so anxious last year due to this that I refused to attend school for the second semester because I feared what people thought of my weight. Over the summer, my binging decreased (but I still binged occasionally). I am now back in school, and sure enough, my severe binging has returned.. Any time I attempt to diet, I always end up binging even more by the end.I went to a psychologist and a psychiatrist when I stayed out of school and into the summer (over 5 months) but they really didn't help at all. I am reluctant to visit any others at the moment because I feel like I will have the same experience.. I don't know what to do for myself.It would be great if someone could give me advice
I do not have a history of eating disorders, however I do struggle with anxiety and depression. Recently I've been put on some medicine that caused a decent amount of weight loss. I'm still a healthy weight, but if I lose much more, I will be in danger of being underweight. The issue I'm having stems (I think) from the medicine. It kills my cravings/appetite. I've been eating only about one full meal a day for months. I'm just not hungry. There's inevitably a day or so each month where I'm super hungry and over-eat. This always makes me very sick and I return to eating next-to-nothing out of necessity. Not sure it's classifiable as a disorder, but it's definitely disorderly. Is there anything I can do to to make this any easier/healthier or do I need to consult a doctor?
Hi there. I've been in a downward spiral with my ED's. I've dealt with various parts of the spectrum of ED's for years, and the past few months things have gotten mentally and emotionally much worse. I keep feeling panicky and have had to leave work and drop my courses for the semester since I'm so afraid to be around people due to my poor self image. One thing that I'm struggling with severely right now is bloat/stomach issues. I rarely eat a full meal and I know how irrational that is, but when I do eat, my stomach gets very upset and bloated feeling. It makes it difficult to resist purging. Plus, at this point I'm not dealing with amenorrhea, and starting birth control in the past three months has influenced this, but bloated pms symptoms are also really making me feel so out of control. Is there any way to deal with that? When your body image is already so out of control awful, it is torture to feel like you're losing false control. Also, I was incredibly restrictive with my eating and running dozens of miles weekly earlier this year, but hurt my knee in April and have lost the will and energy and feeling of self worth to exercise. I know I must have gained some weight and lost muscle mass, and am unsure of how to mentally cope.Thank you.
Hi,My girlfriend is a recovering binge eater. She's worked hard for a year to eat healthy and lose weight. However, today she had a huge setback. She ate everything in the fridge at her work and even picked up boxes of cookies on her way home. I want to ask the community what I can do or say to her about seeking coping strategies
Evening folks,As the title suggest, I'm in need of some advice regarding my role in the recovery of my girlfriends eating disorder. As for some background information, we have been together for almost a year now. At the same time, she started having issues with her body image and lowered her self esteem. She has told me that she had been tinkering with the idea of purging for some time before meeting me, but I believe the actual trigger was her starting to see me.A few rough months later, things became better. She finally made an appointment with a therapist. Since then, she has only had one relapse involving purging, right before summer. However, I know that the ED still bothers her and she thinks of it as often as every day. The last months have, all in all, been good, which I am extremely glad for.I am aware of that a complete recovery will take a long time with a lot of support. That to be said, I am glad we managed to progress in a positive direction early on. Lately, has started to exercise almost every day, which worries me. I have also become the only person she still talks to regarding the ED. Since I did not get the chance to attend therapy with my girlfriend, I had to read up on eating disorders and learn the hard way. As a consequence, I have made errors and refrained from taking action too often, putting myself in a helpless position. I am glad she opens up to me, but I neither believe I have the right knowledge to help her, nor that I should be the only person helping her. The latter both for her sake and my own.I need advice on what to do now, because I do not feel that I can be of any actual help at this point. Would it be wise to convince her to make a second appointment with the therapist?On a side note: I have trough all this time tried to play a pure, supporting role, because I had the belief that she should get the chance to resolve her issues by herself. At the same time, I tried to be as supporting as I could, but it has been hard on me to. Especially after her mother found out and used much stricter methods, once going as far as telling my girlfriend that she was disappointed in her. Since I did not believe it was in my role to take any action, I still hold a grudge. I tried my best to not transform my girlfriends problem to my own, but paradoxically, it has affected me. I do not regard myself being on good terms with her mother, something I keep mostly to myself. She has also proved herself not to be willing enough to change the family's eating habits, which I perceive to contain unnecessary fat.I'm not sure about what I should do with my own problems, but I guess I have to help myself in order to help my girlfriend again?TL;DR: I am unsure on how I can help my girlfriend recover completely after a few months of purging disorder, whereas I at the same time do no longer feel like I have the knowledge and resources to help her. You could say I also struggle with this.
Hi there. I just recently discovered this sub so bear with me. I suffered from AN for about four years and during that time I started forming really negative views towards other women. Most of this was founded on jealousy over physical aspects, but over time, it was also compounded by the fact that several of the people I dated cheated on me (and because my mind was being afflicted by the AN, I blamed the girls, instead of the guys). For the most part, I feel recovered. I still have thoughts once in a while but they're brief and fleeting and nothing comes from them. The main problem is that I still really struggle with other women -- if they're remotely attractive and are near my age, then I immediately feel jealousy and think negatively of them. Obviously this is a really unhealthy behaviour and I want to get over it. I also have anxiety/GAD and depression/MDD, if that matters. Does anyone have any tips on how I can get over this and start having healthy friendships with girls my age? Thanks in advance!
One of my best friends, who I met IP for AN and was my room mate for roughly a month in hospital took her own life just over two weeks ago. The memorial was yesterday and now I feel so lost and alone. She was my biggest supporter and now I feel like I'm slipping back to old habits and I have no idea what I'm doing. Has anyone else experienced something similar? If so, any advice on how to get through this would be very much appreciated x
I've said it so many times, I feel like i'm not gonna be taken seriously. But I finally realized how sick I really do look, after taking a look at my wedding pictures. My husband is fully aware of my ED, we just got married(literally today) ... I don't want to put these stressors on him. But I feel like I honestly need the help. This time I do have something to lose if I don't get better. I just need a little bit of encouragement to bring this up to him.
I don't really know what exactly triggered it (quitting my job, moving cities, getting married -so much stress right now), but I've fallen so hard back into the b/p cycle and I don't know what to do. I hadn't purged for a year when I started doing it again back in April or May, and now it's a thing happening 2-3 times per week. The binges started off small, just going over my planned calories by a modest amount but now they are crazy. I've been on a week long eating bender since last Saturday and I've gained several pounds. I feel so out of control, but also powerless to stop it. I feel like a terrible person because I'm subtly manipulating my fiancé into letting me eat whatever I want - just tons of excuses and little lies. I'm just waiting till he gets fed up with me and leaves. Maybe I should break up with him to spare him the torture that a life with me will be. I love him so much but sometimes I wish he would break up with me so I could kill myself and be done with this world. I'm not actively suicidal, but the ideation is so strong that I can't help fantasizing.Help please. Im losing it :(
Iv been with my partner for nearly two years now. I knew early on that he had suffered from Bulimia as a teenager and then about a year into our relationship i discovered that his bulimia had returned. Iv tried my best to be as supportive as possible and done a lot of research but at this stage i'm leaving him to deal with it on his own, at his request.Our relationship isn't perfect and we have had some issues which mainly stem (for me) from the lack of intimacy. About a year ago, all the intimacy/sex in our relationship ceased. This is coincidentally around the same time the bulimia re-appeared and the same time we were having a lot of issues.This has caused me to become extremely frustrated and confused and as a female it has made me lose all self confidence (thinking its me and the way i look or that he doesn't love me) and made me very untrustworthy of him (thinking he must be cheating with someone else). Iv confronted him many times and he's given me the following reasons at various stages - I don't feel loved by you - I feel judged by you - Its your attitude and the way you speak to me - I'm just stressed about work - I just don't feel good about myselfIn the past year we have had sex twice. Its had a great effect on me mentally and emotionally as i'm happy to forgo sex for months, but he wont even kiss me. The extreme lack of intimacy is eating away at me. The most i get is cuddles in bed.Iv done some research and cant seem to find that decreased sex drive is really a symptom in Bulimia. If some men on here can offer some insight because i'm going crazy constantly thinking that something else is going on or that he doesn't love me and is just using me as a crutch! I cant wrap my head around the fact that he's gone this long without any sexual desire and have convinced myself that hes cheated!Please help. I know this may sound selfish but Its been a year of me being patient and understanding and i don't know what to do anymore. I'm a mental and emotional wreck.
I'm going to be turning 18 in a few months, so no one will be able to put me in treatment unless I really want to be there and my options for treatment will be pretty limited since I'll be booted out of the program I'm in now for AN (diagnosed roughly 2 years ago). My issue is that with being an adult and moving out of the family home shortly after that, I really don't think I have the capability not to relapse. I already cut corners a lot and slip back into restrictive patterns and over exercising as soon as I get any leeway. I'm currently at the lower end of healthy weight and I've been here for a little under a year. I can mostly manage the eating part without freaking out but mentally and body image wise it's still pretty bad. I'm not sure if I should consider going into a more intensive program (day treatment or residential again) or if I should wait and see how things go on my own? I don't really have much in the way of support other than LT boyfriend but this puts a lot of pressure on him which makes me feel guilty. Any advice on how to proceed or things I could try to counter the thoughts would be very much appreciated xx
I have been struggling with bulimia for nearly three years now, and have since come to terms with the fact that self-help alone isn't working for me and that I should seek outside help with recovery. I have a decently close relationship with my friends and family, but since I retain a fairly healthy weight and wear very concealing clothing even when I don't, they haven't noticed.The only problem is that they very frequently crack jokes about EDs and bulimia especially, calling everyone who has them crazy, stupid, overly dramatic, and desperate for fake attention among other derogatory terms. I have even proposed a hypothetical situation with one of my closest friends about how she would react to a friend coming out to her about bulimia, and her supposed response would be to laugh in their face.Furthermore, I am a minor currently in high school, so I can't pursue professional help without them being legally obligated to inform my parents. I have considered going to my school guidance counselor, but our school rules require them to notify parents of any issues with their children's health.I apologize if this seemed a bit like a rant, but I'm simply tired of being controlled by my ED and don't know how I can start taking steps towards recovery. Any advice?
I really don't want to slip into old habits.Back in high school I had very high anxiety and part of that led me to restricting eating to very little or what I thought was little. My anxiety made me very self conscious about what I ate and how I looked. Never getting more than a certain weight. Sometimes lower though. Then I got put on medication that helped the anxiety but I gained a lot and now I'm in the obese category for BMI.I'm now trying to get back to at least average weight. But I'm really afraid of slipping into old habits of not eating. I heard the best way is to track calories but when I see how little i've eaten I get too happy. I just really need advice about getting back in shape but not getting into old habits.
I've had a long and complicated history with food. I've almost always been overweight or obese. I won't go into my whole history because it's long and and a boring story. But basically I feel like my dysfunction with food really increased when I moved out of my parents house. I was obese but not as high weight as usual, and at a low weight for me in adulthood. Thanks to constantly binge eating I soon gained to my highest weight. Following a manic episode I moved back into my parents house and kind of bad it but me how terrible I felt. And I started restricting. I've been eating very few calories, with an occasional high calorie binge. I abuse laxatives regularly. I b/p when I'm left alone for a period of time. This isn't the first time I've done This. I've gone through periods where I binge for months and put on a ton of weight and then restrict for months and take a bunch off.A friend of mine thinks there's something wrong. I don't know. I feel like an imposter. I'm still obese.  I'm so fat it just doesn't seem like I could have an ED. I dunno.Not eating is the best way I've found to deal with the binge eating. Its like the only way I've found to cope. And it's addictive. I just don't know what to do otherwise. My therapist doesn't help. Nobody can help. I know that I'm too fat for it I've found myself looking at a lot of pro ana and thinspo and stuff like that and its just messing with me mentally. This stuff is all getting in the way of life again and I hate it.I know this reads like a rant and sorry for that. I'm just looking for someone to tell me what I should do
I've been in recovery for BED and Bulimia for about 3 years and have been smoking weed for 1. I gained weight and still suffer from dysmorphia issues. Medical weed has certainly helped with the guilt associated with eating but often leads me to overeat to the point where all I can think about is purging. For those who smoke weed to help with their eating disorder, how does it help/hinder you?
I'm in highschool, and I've had weight issues for as long as I can remember. However, I was always pretty good at hiding it. Over the last year I'd thought I was getting better. I was a little over the weight I'd told myself I'd kill myself at, officially a healthy weight, and I was managing to not completely freak out.A few weeks ago I went to the doctors for the first time in a while. My mom came with me and wanted to see my weight. Since then, she keeps making jokes about how I'm such a tub of lard and stuff. I haven't completely freaked out and relapsed yet, but I can feel it coming. I don't know what to do without telling her about this part of my life that no one knows about.
So let me start with some background:I'm currently a 21 year old male, 5'11" and and normal weight. About 2 years ago, I began a pretty strict low carb diet to loose some weight (I used to have a lot more fat on my body) while I trained with workouts such as p90x. I got in pretty good shape, and after about a year I loosened up my diet a little bit. This isn't to say I ate whatever, but I wasn't as concerned as I used to be.However, since that change I began to develop a terrible binge habbit. I would eat well most of the week, but then on the weekend I might end up seriously binging on some food. It started out not so bad, I might eat like a couple pieces of cake or something. But it's progressively gotten worse. Now, I eat a very  large number of calories in a sitting when I binge, like I literally cannot stop. I just don't feel full when I do. I can eat an entire package of cookies and then start to kind of feel full. And even worse, I've developed a guess a minor case of bulimia where whenever I binge I feel guilty and try and toss it up. (I don't do this when I eat regularly, just when I binge or eat bad).I just don't know what to do. I feel like I can never tell my body that I shouldn't eat something. It mainly happens with "feel good" food especially sweets. If it's in front of me, I'll eat it no questions asked. It's getting bad and I'm to the pint where it may start to become my main diet and I will start becoming extremely unhealthy in my weight and physical appearance. I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I'm desperate for advice. 
I have never been overly concerned about my body and how it looked until after high school when I stopped my ballet classes and slowly started putting on weight (in hindsight even during my time in ballet I did worry slightly about weighing too much and at one stage was secretly glad when I got sick because I lost some weight).Along the way I was dianosed with depression and GAD by one GP and was prescribed Lexapro. I gained weight. I attempted to tell several doctors but since weight gain wasn't an official side effect I was brushed off and after a while I was so desperate I stopped taking them.on my own. But the weight wouldn't move. Eventually I had a breakdown and it was decided I needed to be on meds again. I was put on Seroquel. I put on a heap of weight. I started craving chocolate and bread like crazy. I tried to just 'eat an orange' when I got a craving like everyone told me to do, but it didn't seem as easy as that. At the end my weight was significantly higher than it was when I was dancing.I decided to take things into my own hands and started exercising (interval cycling for half an hour) and drinking shakes to lose weight. And for a while it worked. I brought my weight down. But it didn't last. The weight slowly crept up. And the exercising became excessive. Sometimes I would do the usual half hour two or three times a day, depending on whether I thought I had slipped up and eaten something bad. It got to the stage where it was hurting to cycle and I would have to stop, but I would want to keep going.So currently as of three weeks ago I'm back up to the weight I was under Seroquel. In recent years my diagnoses have changed slightly: depression, social phobia and Aspergers. My psych has paired up metformin with the seroquel in the hopes that it may help but nothing. I start reading about keto and give that a try. I have lost some weight. I'm happy with this. It seems sensible. But now I'm getting ectopic heartbeats possibly due to the diet not providing enough electrolytes. So I have to have tests and I may have to give that up when it was going so well. On the way home tonight I was seriously considering either throwing up what I'd eaten today or buying some laxatives, as I've had those before when I've been unwell and I know they could work. But I don't want it to come to that.I didn't realise until now how much I hate my body, how gross I am and how much I really really just want things to go right for once.Do I have an ED? Can anyone offer advice?
Hi there, I'm new to all of this... I was officially diagnosed with binge eating disorder nearly three weeks ago and this week was given a place in a program, but it doesn't start for another month.I feel like I'm in a weird kind of limbo where I have recognised there is a problem, but can't do anything about it yet, and it's messing with my head a bit.I'm scared about the program, that I'll get there and they'll tell me I don't really have a problem, and I'll be left to my own devices all over again. I keep telling myself I'm wasting everyone's time in trying to get help.Not sure exactly what I'm asking for, mainly support and hearing about other's experiences at this point in their journey? I don't know anyone IRL who has gone through this, and in fact I haven't told anyone beyond my husband and obviously my doctor that I have an ED.Thanks in advance!
I would like more information on healthy eating
Hey,I'm a recovering ana/mia. It's been four years since my last major episode and, although I slip up here and there, most days I feel pretty safe in my recovery. That has, however, come with a lot of weight gain. Obviously, that's to be expected, but I'm a 5'7" woman and a little overweight. I just don't feel WELL, you know? I want to lose weight and get back in shape, but I don't know how to do that without extreme restricting and over-exercising. How do you lose weight in a healthy, happy way without falling back in to old habits?
I have been struggling with a binge eating and purging disorder for almost 7 years. I am 30 years old now and it was almost completely absent, though the disordered thinking regarding weight and food never completely leave, until recently. I have started to binge and purge again for the first time in almost a year and I am beside myself with guilt, shame, and repulsion.I believe this last set back could be due to my cycles. Do any other women here experience instability during/before their menstrual cycle? Perhaps I am not alone and this relapse is due to my body craving iron or something?It always starts with me being unsatisfied with life and then eating to fill some sort of void, whatever that void may be. I am being treated for type two bipolar and that helps a lot because the sad spells don't come as often but this last one has me in its throws and, to my complete surprise, the eating disorder has come back full fledged.What do you do when this happens?
I'm bulimic and I have been for about 4 years. Every day is the same, I'm consumed by food. I throw up everything that I eat. I go to the supermarket, to buffets, and buy food to eat and throw up. When my parents are asleep at night I stay up, cook and then do it all over again.It's never ending. My body is constantly exhausted and all I can think about is food. My whole family knows about this. I've had counselling, a dietician, a crisis nurse and I'm still stuck.I'm trying to recover. I've recently gained weight so my bmi isn't scarily low. My dietician has helped my keep down one food, cereal, so I try to use that to gain weight. But I feel I can't control anything else about this disorder. How can I stop this?
Hi, I was hoping you might be able to help with some input. I recovered from my most serious bout of anorexia (with hospitalisation) about 7 years ago, but had a relapse about 1+1/2 years back that I felt like I recovered from (mostly on my own). Recently I've been feeling physically awful, and have also lost a bit of weight (other people have said so - I don't weigh myself). I keep getting illnesses and I feel exhausted all the time - like sleeping for 16 hours a day when I can kind of exhausted, and falling asleep sitting up at work a few times.I can't tell whether this is a result of my body trying to repair the damage from my more recent relapse, if I'm generally ill, or just lazy. I feel like my last relapse wasn't that bad, and it's been so long since it happened, but I've also read other people say they suffered bouts of tiredness for up to 2 years following recovery.I'm also not sure whether I could be slipping back into restriction and it's that which is causing the exhaustion. I have lost a bit of weight, but I don't feel like I'm restricting at all... I just wondered if anyone else had any similar experiences (of extreme tiredness/frequent illnesses like this) and what caused this issue for them.

Female, vegetarian. BMI in the "underweight" range. I want the answer to be no, but looking at the facts doesn't make me too confident. I skip meals, breakfast always and lunch when I'm too lazy to pack one to take to work or school, and then eat oversized meal with lots of snacks when I get home to make up for not eating all day. This past winter I lost a significant amount of weight because when I get busy with school and work, food becomes my last priority but I've yet to put it back on. I am happy with the way my body is currently, but not happy with the number on the scale mostly because I'm worried what others would think of it. I've tried getting my family to help with my eating habits but they're busy and don't notice if I don't eat. I don't relish eating, I love it actually, cooking too but I don't know. I don't think this is healthy either way.
I would like to purchase an ED-friendly cookbook for my girlfriend who is in recovery. Any recommendations?

A friend of mine (we are in a treatment centre together) has a severe and long-standing eating disorder. Unfortunately she must go home for two days soon and home is a massive trigger for her.I am trying to find a piece of music for her that she can take with her as a piece of support. Essentially, the messages I'm trying to say are:1) She is not her ED, I want her to keep remembering who she is distinct from the ED (Golden-hearted, there for everyone, a bit cheeky, perhaps pixie-like).2) That while she's got knocked down before, she's always got back up and never given up the fight. There's a strength in her she doesn't always see.Does anyone know of any music that fits? My own collection has come up dry.
I'm wondering if there's an explanation for feeling very low energy during early recovery and if so, how long it has taken for others to feel stamina and energy levels returning. Oddly, I felt more "pep" and even physically stronger when I was regularly engaging in binge/purge behaviors. Does the repair and recovery process even contribute to fatigue more than the actual Ed? I'm committed to recovery, but I do find this part hard. I like to be gently active most days to take the edge off anxiety but lately even my walking can feel like I'm dragging my tired self around.
I have been calorie counting for years now. I did it to help my ED and I used it to make sure I was eating enough through recovery and motivation. I recognize that I am obsessed with it and how to fit my numbers in everyday. I tried intuitive eating but still tracked my calories during the day and did not look at my calories until the end of the day to see how much I would typically eat. Everytime I intuitively eat, I eat much less than I am supposed to. I will lose weight rapidly if I continue to intuitively eat and I do not want that. I am asking, will I ever be able to eat normal? As of right now I have to track my calories to make sure I eat enough. Full disclosure: I am on thyroid medication and birth control because I have an overactive thyroid. 
My girlfriend and I have been together for a while now but we just broke up.  I am someone who is easily affected by people's emotions and it was pretty hard for me to constantly support her through her ED recovery (I lost a lot of weight myself while dating her).  I would even go home after helping her through an episode feeling extremely anxious, a feeling that I have never felt before in my life.  I felt like she was too dependent on me for support, the people she used to go to before we started dating she no longer felt comfortable talking to.  She would even not talk to her therapist truthfully.  I still love her with all my heart and talk to her everyday.  She wants to get back together, but disregarding my own hardships, I am wondering if taking some time off would help her recovery (which has stagnated and she has perhaps even been relapsing) or if I am enabling her by being with her? My original thought towards taking a break was with the intention of getting her to be less dependent on me for support and for her to have a wider network of people who can be there for her.  It was extremely hard for me to leave her because I don't know what will happen to her but I still care about her.  I hope she isn't reading this post but I'm going to therapy with her in a couple days so maybe that will help shed light on the situation as well.
I always ate a lot and my weight always fluctuates between normal and overweight, though during my school days people were convinced I was heavier. I just ate a lot of unhealthy stuff with my friends and healthier stuff at home and I didn't give it much thought afterwards.Fast forward to 2016 where I'm pretty sure this got more serious. I eat mostly the same stuff (slightly healthier if anything) but my attitude towards food has become really unhealthy. I'm unable to eat without thinking about what I'm doing to my body, and sometimes I try to limit my intake of calories but it doesn't last long and I end up binge eating. It's not related to hunger, even if I'm full I will keep eating and when I'm stressed it gets worse. Sometimes at night I really have the urge to eat after all my meals are already over, so I wait until breakfast, but instead of falling asleep and eating after waking up like a normal person, I stay up all night so I can eat as early as possible, usually between 3-4am. Then hopefully I will fall asleep late enough that I will wake up at dinner time and not earlier, because some days meal times are literally the only thing I'm looking forward to.I don't know what to do, I try to eat healthy, I get hungry, I eat more, then I end up binging. I try to make things better by exercising but after cutting back fast food and exercising for a while I actually gained weight so I mostly do it to trick myself into thinking binging won't be that bad to my body.  I want to stop but I can't help thinking about food all the time. What are the first steps I should take towards fixing this?
Hi. I'm a male with what I think is anorexia. I'm always occupied with food and hate eating even a single cracker and I checked the symptoms as well. I matched nearly all of them. I used to train like crazy but over the past month or so, I can barely do anything since i'm so exhausted all day, everyday. In addition, my chest and heart also hurt like hell whenever I run now which is new. please, i need some help - what are my next steps?
Basically the title says it all. Most times I'm not hungry but when I am I have the physical urge to vomit after. Also sometimes I get super painful shocks from my throat to my stomach that make me not want to eat because it hurts so bad. I don't want to vomit or feel this way. Most times I force myself to eat or have to smoke weed to make myself eat. This has been going on since I was about 13 and I'm 19 now. I don't know what is wrong with me or if I have an ED. I didn't know where else to ask this so sorry if I'm not welcome. What's wrong with me?
I've been recovered (from anorexia) for four years now and even though I normally do pretty well, I do sometimes find myself tempted to fall back into old habits.After recovery I was in the low middle range of a healthy weight and I was totally happy there! I was confident, felt beautiful, and actually felt thinner than I did when I was very underweight during my ED (body dysmorphia caused that, I guess). But recently I've gained weight and I'm now at the higher end of healthy and it's driving me insane. I think about it constantly, I feel huge, nothing fits, it's making me want to cut sometimes, I hate wearing fitted clothes (which is, like, my entire wardrobe), I can't even let my fiance see me shirtless, and it's affecting the way I feel about my value as a person too. I hate it.I wish I could do it the healthy way without it being a huge hassle. All I want is to be able to lose some weight without it turning into a massive anorexia thing. The first time I had it, it lasted for almost a decade and it was miserable. So I'd prefer not to do that again...So my first reaction was "Okay, I just need to lose the weight I gained and I'll be fine." Which is... normal, right? I think that part is okay, and I'm definitely set on getting back to my normal weight. But I'm not sure I'm capable of going about it the way you're "supposed" to because my first thought was to look at thinspo, make an account on a pro ED forum I used to frequent, berate myself constantly for being fat, and--of course--restrict heavily and exercise a lot. I guess I just feel like if I'm not doing those things then I'm not working hard enough, and some part of me still believes that if I'm not at a certain weight then I'm not worth as much or something. Like, I don't deserve to be happy until I'm back to that weight, because until then I'm just a piece of shit person with no value. Which logically I know isn't true, but sometimes it feels that way?Also, one big problem I had when my ED was at its worst was the self harm it caused me to perform. I hated my stomach the worst (and that's my problem today) and I would often cut there because I hated it and I guess that's just how I took out my anger. I don't know, but I'm finding myself more and more tempted to do that, too. I haven't told my fiance that part because I don't want him to worry about me, but it's getting hard to deal with. Any advice for that too?
I've had an ED for a number of years and for the last few years I've been in recovery. Recently, I started working with a nutritionist who told me I wasn't eating enough fat. So, I started to have a tablespoon of healthy oils with each meal. At first I tolerated it well and my skin and hair have been looking much better but lately I've been feeling really nauseous. Has anyone else experienced this? I also think it has to do with my cycle. Premenstrually my appetite increases and my digestion feels robust but in the first half of my cycle my appetite dampens to the point where I don't feel like eating but if I don't eat I get low blood sugar. Does anyone else experience these strong hunger cues that fluctuates over their cycle? Can anyone offer advice?
Hi, I'm currently in recovery and things are going on well, however, I struggle sometimes with the fact that I have to eat more than other people. I manage to push this fear away, because I know this is the only path for me to become healthy again. But, I fear that when I will be weight restored, I will still have this guilt for eating more than other people on some occasions, when others around me aren't hungry, or eat differently.I have trouble accepting the idea that when I'm normal, I may sometimes want more than another person, as I've always felt that would make me abnormal or give me the body shape that I fear.Has anyone had a similar experience? Do you have any ideas about how to push away the fear, or to get rid of these persistent ideas? Thanks for any help.
So I've been struggling with binge eating for several years off and on. Since this time last year I've put on a significant amount of weight from uncontrollable binge eating. Its gotten so bad that I've started purging again. But I've found a way to stop binging. I've been fasting and severely restricting my daily calorie intake. And when I do this I feel like I can control my binging. But I know it's unhealthy. Idk. I don't know how to find that middle ground between binging and restricting. I guess I was hoping for advice.
Over the past two years, I struggled with anorexia nervosa and became underweight. One of the things I did to manage hunger was to drink copious amounts of water. I regularly drank until my stomach was sloshing with water and I felt sick. After a while of this, it became that I was always thirsty and that I would have to go to the bathroom constantly.Right now, my weight has been restored to the pre-ED weight and I am eating a healthy amount of food each day (although I still am neurotic and obsessive over calorie counts). However, I still have constant thirst and frequent urination. This time, I'm not drinking water to deal with hunger, but with thirst. I drink way more water than I did before my ED, but water just seems to go through me, and I feel thirsty again after an hour.Did I break something with regard to my body's water regulation? Should I see a doctor about this?
I go through cycles of eating too much then not eating at all. Recently I've been in the "eating too much" stage.I feel hungry all the time. No matter how much I eat- even if I begin to feel sick, I'm never satisfied and it feels like I've eaten nothing. I've gained a significant amount of weight in just over a year and it's completely demolished my self-esteem.I'm completely at a loss for what to do. I've tried changing what I eat and when I eat. My relationship with food has become so unhealthy that I only see food as a source of pleasure or punishment. I can't just eat because it's "dinner time".
I have been struggling with bulimia on and off for several years. I'm now at the point in my recovery where I am ready to see a dentist (I had stopped once I started purging), but I'm afraid. They're going to know my history with one look in my mouth.When looking for a new dentist, is there something I should look for? Something I should say when scheduling the first appointment?I have a lot of anxieties when it comes to dentists because of my past disorder so any advise would be greatly appreciated!!
Backstory: I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder. It has caused me to restrict my food intake for many reasons: * physical stress reaction cutting my appetite * excessive and irrational worry about time management and money (skip meals to gain time/save money) * excessive and irrational worry about physical appearance (was at a healthy weight when GAD was diagnosed,am now slightly underweight) * feeling of control/ as a way to control feelings of guilt or inadequacy (ex: I beat myself over my lack of discipline; I will limit my food to "prove" I can have self discipline/control.) * Ashamed to admit it but simply to harm myself, as a "punishment" or a "test".I've doing much better lately in general but my anxiety about calorie intake, physical activity and physical appearance has grown slightly stronger (especially if I can't go to the gym as its the case for all of August as I am traveling or if I can't control my food as much or decide to have an ice cream or a bigger meal for example.) My psych's take on it was that, since most things are going better, I am focusing my anxiety on something that I feel like I can control. It goes on and off and it isn't too bad as I'm not losing weight rapidly but I am terrified of gaining some as I fear I won't be able to control that and end up heavier than I'd want to be. It's not always worrying me but when it does it makes me very unhappy...Tips on getting over that fear and guilt? When I go back to uni in a month, my anxiety will become much worse and I'm scared it will only add to the issue.
My friend has had troubles with anorexia and bulimia for years now, it was bad enough that a few years ago she had to go to Renfrew to get better, a year after that she looked healthy and she was gaining weight again, but recently, every time she eats, not more than 5 minutes after, she goes to the bathroom and she stopped gaining weight and rather lost more weight. I'm concerned that she's falling back into it and if she is, is there a way to approach this lightly? Thank you.
Hi, I'll try to keep it short, but I'm fairly sure my girlfriend is developing anorexia. She has been rapidly losing weight this summer, and only allows herself to eat a very low number of calories each day, and says she likes to burn that off while exercising and then some. She does at least two intense workouts a day, usually running at least 8 miles or more for one of them. She tells me she constantly feels bloated and cries looking at all the fat she doesn't want in the mornings. She is at a healthy weight right now, but says she wants to keep losing weight. She also has told me on a couple occasions that she's made herself throw up after eating something with too many calories, like an avocado or pastry. I did try to discuss this with her once, albeit not very tactfully, and she got very upset and defensive, saying that she used to suffer from depression and anxiety and she wasn't that bad anymore. I'm not sure how to discuss this without upsetting her, but I'm very concerned for her health, she says she always has headaches and is getting back spasms that she didn't used to get. How do I approach this topic in a way that won't bother her or make her defensive? Thank you for any help
So Anorexia Nervosa is the eating disorder and Anorexia is the loss of appetite?I am a female at a healthy weight, however I have recently lost a lot of weight in the last 3 weeks and it's starting to scare me. I feel like shit all the time. My head hurts, my body hurts, my heart is beating too fast. I am weak, but I am not hungry. I used to have a food addiction and used food as a coping mechanism for living with people I hated. I finally moved out and decided to only eat when I'm hungry... but I'm never hungry. I eat 3 small meals each day, and it satiates me, but I am losing weight and feeling weak.What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm so scared. I want to be hungry again but I can't eat if I'm not hungry because it feels like acting on my addiction. Help.
I'm posting here out of desperation to try and help my GF realize she has major body dysmorphia. She is 35 and on the lower side of healthy weight. Thankfully she eats regularly, so I don't think she qualifies as anorexic. I think she is absolutely beautiful and nobody would ever think that she has weight issues. But to hear her talk about herself it's always extremely negative comments. Every morning when she gets dressed it's like this. She goes on about how her clothes are touching her funny, and nothing looks good on her, that she finds herself disgusting. It always ends up with her breaking down and crying hysterically. She says she doesn't want to go on living like this, and I can tell she's hurting horribly inside.If I try to point out that she is not at heavy at all I always get the same "You're lying to me! I see what I look like in the mirror and pictures. Stop trying to act like this isn't a problem!" So it's obvious to me that what she sees of herself isn't what any other person sees.I really want her to get the help she needs, but she won't even admit this is a problem. She thinks that I'm lying to her so that she'll "just accept being fat." Every time I press the issue we get into a big fight. And even if I don't say anything she has a mini-breakdown almost every morning.What can I do to help her realize that her weight is completely healthy and that she needs to get help with these issues? I love her and want to help her through this, but I can't do anything until she realizes there's a problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Because of a previous episode my family had to hide the weighing scales from me, and I haven't seen them in over a year. Now I've started losing weight recently. It wasn't intentional, it was just because I went on a holiday and had to restrict what I ate. On holiday I kind of knew I was underweight because of all the walking we did, and I got double vision a lot. But now that I'm back I want to remain at this weight, so it's caused bit of a 'relapse' in me. Once again, I've started restricting my diet when I just reached a healthy weight beforehand, but I am eating whole meals, if they can be called that. I'm definitely eating better than I was on holiday, so the double vision has mostly stopped now.I ask this because just before writing I noticed some dry skin on my hand, and this was one of the symptoms my old eating disorder therapist would point out. But I don't feel anything drastically different. I have no idea if I should be worried, though, because I can't weight myself, so I can't say for certain whether I'm underweight. Any signs I should look for?
I've had a lot of issues with binging for about 6 years off and on. I've been on lately, having issues with binging almost daily again. And when I can get away with it I've been purging again.I've talked to my therapist previously about having issues with binging and didn't receive much advice beyond "eat salad" which I guess can be helpful, but not really too much.So I don't really know what to do. I feel like I'm losing control of everything again.
Hey there,Have been concerned about my long time boyfriends eating habits lately and wanted to post to ask if I am worrying over nothing. Recently realised that if I am out he will not eat or if he does only eat pasta + something for flavour.Many Thanks
I (M/30) need help on the right path to help my wife (28/F) with BN. We have been together for 5 years and her ED has always been something that we are working on, she has gone to inpatient treatment and seen many therapists and nutritionist. Currently our insurance is terrible and we can't really afford any treatment options in a formal paid way. As for me, I have been a lurker here for a while, as well as attending some appointments with her and doing a lot of the research. I have come to terms with the fact that it is her problem, and that I am here to support her while giving the space needed, no finger pointing or shaming.That brings us to now, she is going through a pretty bad stretch, and has now asked me to pretty much take over her life. She wants me to control her money, have all her account information, lock up all the food, and track her location when she goes out. I don't feel like this is a good idea because I will be the barrier between her and her comfort, and I can see her really resenting me for that. She has also stated repeatedly that she needs space, which I get and oblige her, that is why this idea doesn't seem good. Has anyone done anything similar? What are some alternative ideas? I want to have a good talk with her but I want to be very well prepared before I do so.
So my friend who I know online has told me that she doesn't like eating food. She says that just seeing food or smelling it makes her want to be sick, and now I'm really worried about her as I thought it could be the first signs of anorexia? This has only been happening since a month ago and she has lost weight. I've told her that she needs to see a doctor but she says she has no energy to do anything and always feels tired and wants to sleep. I've warned her about anorexia and that if she continues then she will lose even more weight. If anyone could post their advice then I will refer her to this thread and let her read the replies. Thank you for any help.
I'm not sure if this is the best place for me, because I don't have the traditional eating disorder - losing weight was a bonus, because I was incredibly overweight before all of this started, but my reason is I'm TERRIFIED of being sick, to the point where I won't eat for weeks on end, especially if I feel sick for some reason or if somebody in the house gets the dreaded sickness bug/norovirus. It's stupid, I know. I've lost a lot of weight very quickly due to my spells of not eating which can last four weeks at once, and going to doctors just prompts 'sign up for the local counselling service' which I have. It's taken a month just to have an appointment for consultation and then the waiting list will likely be very, very long, but I can't afford to go anything but the NHS.I'm not really sure what to do or how to get help with this. When I am eating, I'll binge - I've always been a binge eater, but now I have restriction phases as well and honestly I'm just scared. I don't want to have An eating disorder. What more can I do? I'm in the UK, for reference, and my food aversions aren't helped because I'm on a special diet for my ridiculously bad and painful IBS, which is another reason I'm afraid of eating, especially new things.
About two years ago I broke out of my eating disorder. I finally quit restricting, binging and purging but the result was for me to gain a lot of weight. I was largely able to keep from slipping back into the disorder before by not caring at all what I weighed or looked like and by not restricting anything I ate at all but now I've become obese and on top of looking awful and clothes not fitting it's just not healthy to be the weight I am. So I'm trying to lose it. The problem I'm running into is that when I actually care what the number on the scale says I fall back into restricting and purging. I can't figure out how to care enough about my weight that I stop gaining and lose it healthily but to not care so much that all that matters is losing weight. Is there a way to find a happy middle? Have any of you successfully dieted after an eating disorder?
Since I've developed an eating disorder along obsessive and compulsive exercise, even when I'm hungry I don't feel like eating. Even the smallest amounts of salad feel like too much. I don't understand it, but starving seems preferable. This is a new symptom. What's going on?

Please I don't know where else to go, but I need help controlling my eating. I can control it for sometime by eating healthy things and that isn't a problem for me, but then my parents will buy fast food and its almost impossible for me to turn it down. I soon as I eat it, I can't control my eating and will just eat a ton of food. I'm just looking for tips on how to control my eating and how to say no. I go to the gym and am trying to get fit ( I'm a normal weight. I don't need to gain or lose) but I fear my diet is just screwing me over.
Good day or night to all madams and sirs. I am asking for some assistance in my most recent attempt at AN recovery, which started more or less yesterday.I was a normal overweight man who ate without restriction (or thought) for the first 23 years of my life. Tackling my overweight after that, I was entrenched too deeply into the mindset of "the less I eat, the more efficiently I approach a normal weight", and got stuck quite badly in AN. The thing is, during all this time I exercised strength training with some intermittent cardio periods while still keeping a close eye on my protein intake, so my body was quite strong even though I starved myself in just about any other aspect.When I sought therapy for my disordered thinking (compulsive calorie counting, food restrictions, extreme anxiety around unknown foods et.c.) I was not an extreme case in any way, but the ED started to impair my life quality. After a while I abandoned strength training, which meant I was "free" to not worry about macronutrients any longer, and picked up running, which I have realized I enjoy a lot more.Everything was fine until I started working about a month ago (5 year CS student, never worked a full week before) and anxiety got the better of me, and I started, quite literally, to starve myself in response, living off nicotine gums and energy drinks throughout most of the week. I also realized staying drunk around the clock each weekend helped soothe my nerves.Now I begun eating for real again yesterday, determined to kick my ED in the rear. As with other recovery attempts, it started with a sugar binge. Thankfully, as with my other binges, I have not restricted in response. The question I have is about how I should eat (general goals or recommendations) in my recovery, because the thing is - my weight is just about perfect. I have read that I still require a lot more calories than I would had I never restricted for bodily repairs. Is this correct? The hunger I feel is endless, and I am trying my best not to respond with eating sweets and treats since they are unlikely to give me the nutrients I need; those I eat only for psychological reasons and I still insist on eating balanced meals three times a day. The problem is that the bloat and trembling (possibly hypermetabolism) I feel are causing me a great deal of distress. I guess my question is whether or not I should accept that I will eat quite a lot in recovery or if I shouldn't and instead religiously eat my 3 balanced meals plus 0-3 snacks. I really want my body and mind to start trusting me again though, so I don't go more than 3 hours without eating, but that approach usually means I start grazing and run back and forth between the kitchen all the time...I guess my question boils down to how a normal-weighted person who still has suffered from AN (to the level of multi-day fasts) should recover. All resources I find are (rightfully) aimed at more urgent cases where the sufferers are actually famished, which means there is not much guidance for me (therapists do not consider me underweight enough to warrant help beyond keeping a food diary and commenting on my lack of carbs...)
I have a hard time when it comes to getting enough liquids and it's a serious part of my disorder. I have a lot of trouble when it comes to consistent hydration. I would love if anyone has some tips on how to keep hydrated.
I apologize in advance for the length of the post and for any mistakes, I am not a native English speaker. This is the first time I am open about my problem, and I need to do this now, and in English, because it feels less 'real'.I am 24, and I have always felt a little 'chubby', not fat, just a little bit plump. 4 years ago I decided to lose some weight. It quickly became addictive. I started with a healthy diet and regular exercise, and then, in an effort to "make it better, make it faster", I switched to a restrictive regime, where I would count calories and have panic attacks if the total daily intake exceeded a very small number. I also binged once a week, at night, and cried myself to sleep.This had effects on every single aspect of my life. I started experiencing short memory losses. I was acting resentful and sour all the time. I started to stare at people's bodies and to mentally calculate their size, and then to compare it to mine. I remember one and a half year after I started, I looked myself in the mirror, passed my finger my ribs and thought "I looked like Christian Bale in the Machinist", and I was proud. I was proud of it.I avoided many social events, either because they could be related to food, or because I was 'too fat' to be seen by people. Everybody suspected I had problems, but I always strongly denied, even if I recognized it myself from the beginning. It felt like I was "beating the dieting system", somehow.Last year, I was selected for an internship experience abroad. Somehow, this triggered me a complete reversal. At first, I tried to stick with my habits, but in an effort to integrate with coworkers and to build a social net, I had to compromise. And I "remembered" how I loved to eat: long story short, I started to binge. To think constantly about food, to hope I'd end my working hours just to run to the first supermarket.I gained most of my weight back, and didn't care about it in the process. But now... Now I am stuck into a spiral of self loathing and anxiety. I have all the drawbacks of an ED, but I am also fat now.I hate myself for having failed. I hate myself for having thrown away all my effort. I hate myself because I used to be attractive.And, I don't know what to do. I start my old routine, but then I am weak, and I binge. I hate it. I have daily suicidal thoughts but at the same time I don't want to die 'fat'. Really. I really have this thought.I am sorry again for the long post. I needed to say it out loud, I needed to know I am not the only one. I need help.
What can I do to gain weight? I have tried and some of the time I undereat or overweight without realizing, mainly when I undereat. I cant seem to gain weight and I need help with getting my weight normal.
I definitely cannot handle any kind of actual diet w/o being "triggered" I guess is the word? I am currently overweight, and would like to be a healthier weight. Some of the weight I gained while recovering was muscle, but other is not.
Hi everyone, here is a research study you might be interested in. Adults with current or past eating disorders (e.g., anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, compulsive overeating) are invited to participate in a University of Minnesota doctoral student research study on eating disorder recovery that involves completing a 10-15 minute online survey. Survey responses are anonymous. If you are interested in this study, please go to the survey link: www.surveymonkey.com/r/edrecovery. Alternatively, you can contact the doctoral student researcher, Nora Durkin, for more information at 612-625-1586 or umnedstudy@gmail.com.
My gf of about a year has been recovering from her Ed for about two years.recently something has triggered her Ed to get worse I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to help her(we can't afford therapy)
I am trying to understand consent in regards to mental issues in the United States.My girlfriends anorexia has evolved to the point where she literally will no longer eat. She is going in and out of the hospital. She has suicidal thoughts.I want to check her into a mental hospital, but she goes to the hospital and obviously improves. When she is conscious she immediately demands to leave the hospital, and due to consent laws the hospital can't keep her.Is there anyway to override this consent. I have my girlfriend's dad and family on my side. Is there anyway to declare her unfit to make decisions?
She used to be picked on and bullied a lot growing up, now she has depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder. I think she's beautiful and wonderful but lately her insecurities are affecting our relationship and she's believes that I won't be able to handle all the negativity that gets thrown my wayI admit that it does become draining at times but I care so deeply about her that I want to be there for her and help her grow without being her crutch for happiness. I was thinking about taking her to the gym with me and helping her get into a healthy lifestyle that will help put her into a better mindset. I am not sure if that would help her or not because it may trigger her even more if she does get into this lifestyle if she feels like she's not working hard enough or if she has an off day or if she eats to much after a work out.Tl;Dr How can I help her without her feeling that I'm trying to fix her?
Looking into residential. Anyone with experience at Timberline Knolls or Castlewood?
My older sister is about to enter med school and she has been anorexic for about two years now, based on my observations. Everyone in our family is aware of her body/food issues but nobody knows how to help her. I really want to know how I can help her out. Some big advice I read suggested I ignore her issues and making certain topics "off-limits", and I was wondering whether that would be the appropriate course of action?She has been seeing a therapist for a few years as well, but I believe her main topics there were about our parents' divorce. The therapist was not specialized for eating disorders.Also, she has developed ostopenia.How can I help her?
For the last several months I've found myself binging almost daily, and it's been more or less 5 months that I found information about a center in my town for the recovery of people affected by eating disorders - BED included - and collected their contacts, but I haven't been able to find the courage to call it and finally manage to see a therapist about the issue. I'm particularly afraid of failure: if I can't improve with the help of a professional, what else can I do? I also fear the fact that I may not fit the requirements to be allowed in the program. I'm also very emotional and I've found difficult communicating with my former therapist (that I saw in relation to other mental issues) without crying to the point of not being able to speak - the possibility of showing myself in that state to a stranger makes me very reluctant. Basically, I'm trying to get an idea of the possible approaches to the matter and therefore I'm looking others' knowledge about what to expect from therapy and maybe others' experience with it
Hi,I am having some trouble at the moment. I have been struggling with anorexia for a number of years. I am in my twenties now and this year I actually feel like I want to live. I want to recover and be better. however after so much restricting food makes me sick. I am never hungry. I have researched and discovered this can happen to some people. my stomach seems to have shrunk and will not let me eat. it is painful and a disgusting experience to eat a whole plate of food. I have read that its important to push through this so that my stomach stretches but i have no support and my mind is telling me not to. just wondering if anyone has been through this as well to offer some hope or if they know anything about it because my mind (anorexia) is telling me its because i am too fat and need to start restricting again, and i know these are very dangerous thoughts didn't really know where else to come but here . thank you.
So, background, I'm 21F and have always been on the high end of a healthy weight. I struggled with disordered eating (intermittent restricting and purging, both by vomiting and exercising, but never regularly and I never really lost much weight from it) when I was younger (13-17ish) but have been more or less free of these behaviors for several years. I purged once last fall and immediately reached out to my old boyfriend, the only person who knew about my previous struggles, and talked through why I did it, and I haven't had a desire to purge since. I never had any sort of formal treatment, and I never told my parents or anyone except for the ex-boyfriend.Now onto my current issue: recently, I've been getting nauseated every time I eat. It doesn't matter what I eat, it could be a salad or onion rings or half a pint of ice cream but I start feeling really sick, and I keep thinking maybe I'll feel better if I make myself throw up. So far I haven't but I'm scared it's becoming a conditioned response to eating (it also makes me not want to eat, and I don't like skipping meals as routine is very important to me.) Has anyone dealt with anything like this/have any tips?
I have struggled with body acceptance since I was a child, my mother always placed high value on my being thin and would frequently make comments about my weight getting to the "point of no return". About 2 years ago I started to go through phases of being unable to eat anything at all because I felt I didn't deserve food and lost so much weight I hardly recognised myself. I am now past the idea that I don't deserve food and I'm eating a fairly balanced diet. I eat many food groups, however I restrict the type of meat I eat for ethical reasons and then that restricts how much meat I can buy for financial reasons. I try to eat three meals a day but I am still losing weight. None of my clothes fit and I look unhealthily thin.I have seen my family doctor who assures me that nothing is wrong with me and I just need to eat more, "eat more!" that's the only advice I ever get... but the thing is; I can't afford to eat more. I am eating as much as I possibly can for my budget, I think my body is incorrectly digesting food and I can't get my doctor to take me seriously. I'm kinda scared because I feel weak and tired and I shake all the time and I honestly can't seem to gain any weight. I don't know what to do next because I feel like I'm doing everything I can and this is now out of my hands. I'm worried about organ failure if I lose much more weight but where I can't get my doctor to take me seriously I'm unsure how to solve my problem. Any advice?**How can I remain positive and eat for weight restoration when I have financial limitations and past issues with body image?****How can I approach this topic with my doctor to make sure nothing else is causing my weight loss?**(Mod note: please no mentions of specific foods or calorie/nutrient numbers)
My girlfriend has been brave and courageous enough to open to me almost entirely about her eating disorder. She views becoming skinny as a challenge to become the skinniest, as it's the only she feels like she can do. She doesn't feel like she's important to anyone (and I try endlessly to show her how important and incredible and talented I believe she is), and in order to stand out, she needs to be skinny. She recently has started purging again (she hid it from me because she didn't like me getting emotionally involved). She doesn't believe she has an eating disorder, and believes it's just a dietary choice. I've tried encouraging her to create things for herself, like painting or drawing, or to go out in public by herself and just hangout. She's constantly thinking about how she thinks she's fat and how she knows she is, because she can see it. I can see her just fine, and she's very skinny. She has a goal to lose a certain amount of weight, and I told her I would support her getting there by working out, but she declined that. There's much more that I'm leaving out for time-sake, I just feel like I'm starting to run out of ways to support her to recovery. It pains me to see how much this consumes her.
Background information: Developed anorexia at 16, threw myself into recovery at 19 so I could do my degree. Been in 2 relationships since where food was largely cooked and decided for me as my partners were quite foody people.More recently: Split up with ex of 2.5 years, moved to a new city and found myself very much on my own and having to take responsibility for food. I also started a job where I'm on my feet for most of the day. This coupled with living on cereal and anything that takes less than five minutes to microwave, I basically lost a bunch of weight unintentionally.Very recently, I finally accepted that I needed to buy some clothes that fit because everything was starting to look a bit ridiculously baggy. Since then, I've been super fucking hyper paranoid about gaining the weight back. This has started me back on calorie counting, over exercising and then snapping into a binge. This triggers anxiety, which has lead to cutting as a "punishment".My job is stressful, I drink a lot and I don't care if it's during the week or at the weekend. Most weekends I try and find places to go dancing and get trashed because it's exercise and it makes me forget about how fucked up my head is at the moment. I've joined two running groups during the week and will often go running alone as well. Originally I wanted to try and balance "normal" eating with moderate exercise, but I feel like I'm seriously losing control. I'm exhausted all of the time, I know I need to eat more but I'm scared about getting "fat". People keep telling me I look healthy and they're proud of how active and sociable I'm being, but it's all a really big lie.I've been projecting all of this positivity about doing new activities and eating healthily, but more often than not now, I find myself binging and then self harming to stop the racing thoughts. This happened this evening, which is why I've found myself here.I don't know what to do. Access to mental health services as a 24 year old in the UK is almost impossible unless you're at death's door. I'm tired of being tired, I'm tired of my fucked up relationship with food. I don't have a degree to aim for any more, just working and working and working until I run myself into the ground.I desperately want to care about cooking for myself and I want to stop freaking out about what I'm putting into my body or feeling too full.This is such a messy confession but I really just need some support. I think if anyone close to me knew I was falling back into this hole, they would be heartbroken. Also, it's the most difficult thing to land on someone unless they say something first. I don't want to get to that point.Sorry for the long post. I'm tired and I feel extremely sick and depressed. I have a huge amount of gratitude in advance from any thoughts or advice anyone can give.
Here's a bit of info leading into my questions:I'm in kind of a weird place with my eating disorder right now. I've been through a couple of treatment programs, the last one was about two years ago. I left it in a really good place, I was weight restored(-ish) and I had a huge desire to remain in recovery, but ever so slowly I began to relapse into restrictive eating, my team and I were able to intervene relatively quickly and I was able to pull out of that relapse out patient, without needing a higher level of care.That was about a year and a half ago. Then, I relapsed again this past December and it was a little worse, I didn't really pull myself out of it until late January. Up until about a month ago, I was doing relatively well, then I relapsed again. I'm still in the midst of this relapse and it feels worse this time. I mean, I still know all of the coping skills that I've learned over the last few years, I still remember relearning how to eat "normally", I still recall what motivation I had at the time. None of that seems to matter, though. I feel stuck in this, it feels too overwhelming to deal with. I'm scared that I might need to go back into treatment and that I might not be able to do so.I guess I'm wondering, can anyone relate to this? How did you overcome that relapse? How did you regain your motivation?If you feel more comfortable, please pm me at /u/jljohnson92
A family member (36 f) has been showing signs of an ever-worsening ED. At a recent family gathering, she ate hardly anything for lunch or dinner. She was always a very light eater, but it seems to be getting more extreme each time we see her. The only calories she really seems to take in are in the form of beer, so she's incredibly skinny but not yet completely wasting away. Because of this, it's easier for her closest family members (e.g. her parents, husband, sister) to deny that she has a problem. That said, I've been through similar things myself and see the warning signs all over her behavior. The salads she always ate in place of the meal that everyone else was having no longer contain chicken or oil & vinegar dressing - which was a light but somewhat nutritious meal. Now it's just a bowl of iceberg lettuce with some hot sauce, or something along those lines.Her teeth are decaying, and in addition to the ED, she's a heavy smoker. She also had a stroke in her mid-20s due to a bacterial infection, and even though that was from a secondary cause, it still makes me very nervous for her overall health.What would be the best way to approach a person in this situation about her behavior? She doesn't seem particularly depressed, anxious, etc. , although I wouldn't be surprised if there are things bubbling under the surface. Like I said, she's very thin but not to the point where she looks completely sickly because she has some extra calories coming in from drinking. I feel like my best bet would be to get one of her closest family members to intervene, but how can I best convince them that there's a problem? And what advice would you have for those people in regards to talking to her? (I have a feeling that if i suggest that they talk to her, they'll just say that she won't listen, which is probably true.)Thanks so much in advance for any advice that you might be able to offer.
"Do you know of any literature, book, story compilation, that serves as motivation for people fighting bulimia"? My girlfriend is fighting bulimia and started recently. She reads a lot but unfortunately , only reads about how to lose weight. I'd like to give her something to be entertained, that gives her hope that helps her with this.I'd be very thankful for any support.Best regards, João 
For over a year now I've been dealing with overly-restrictive eating habits that eventually led to binge eating, and in the last few months I've taken steps to work on it. I stopped counting calories, which has helped a lot, and I'm trying to break myself of the habits I developed such as being obsessed with low carbs and weighing myself often.I just started an internship a week and a half ago, and right before I came here I had been going out to eat a ton with friends so I gained a few pounds. I had been trying to lose weight, got very close to my goal weight, but last time I weight myself, I had gained about half of that back. I hated seeing that number, but could accept that it was temporary and I would go back to my normal eating habits soon.So I started my internship, and here I'm extremely active, hiking between 5 to 10 miles a day in the desert. I'm trying to trust that I'm hungry because I'm so active, but the amount I'm eating scares me because I'm so afraid I am going to get fat. I don't have any full length mirrors, so I can't analyze my body and convince myself that I'm skinny, and I don't have a scale so I can't see my weight and reassure myself that I'm not actually gaining weight.I think the main thing is, though, that I don't want to need to see a number on a scale to trust that I'm fit and attractive. If I were to step on a scale right now and it showed what I weighed the last time, it would ruin my week.I'm just so aware of everything I'm eating, how many carbs I'm eating (because I'm sweating a lot and doing physical labor), and I feel like my body feels so huge right now and I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't trust myself to just eat in a way that comes naturally, because I'm going to end up getting bigger.Are there any ways to gain trust in your body and eating habits? Ways to lessen the importance of seeing a certain number on the scale and stop using my weight to validate my self-worth? How do I stop being afraid to eat? 
I have depression and anxiety. I also have a moderate to severe vomiting phobia.I have been overweight to obese to class 2 obese, I have used a very restrictive diet plan to get back down to overweight, and have put most of the weight back on and am obese again.When my stomach is empty, I feel nauseous. The vomiting phobia comes into play here, so I eat to calm that feeling. I also eat when I "deserve" rewards - happy day, sad day, but most often stressful day.Until now I have believed the food behaviors are a symptom of the other issues. But recently I've realized that I don't just eat, I eat defiantly. I pick the least healthy things intentionally. I eat too much, almost daring my body to rebel by vomiting - thinking that maybe if I finally cross that line the phobia will teach me a lesson.If I think of a food that sounds good, I cannot relax until I have eaten that food. It begins to feel obsessive.I am in therapy, but for several reasons it does not seem to be helping. I have a consult with a psychiatrist next month.is this behavior an eating disorder? If so, what would it be called?
Hello readers. I have a few questions running through my head, and am primarily (not only) looking for people with similar experiences.I am a quasi-recovering male anorectic (healthy weight) in his mid-twenties. This last weekend was the third in a row I used alcohol constantly Friday evening up until Monday morning in order to avoid eating. I had also had two days last week, Wednesday and Thursday, where I got through work (CS engineer) on energy drinks, diet soda and nicotine. Needless to say, the pressure from being new at work got the better of my recovery and I relapsed harder than I ever had.My wife (10 year relationship) found me passed out on the toilet (I snuck in there to drink out of sight) and needless to say, she was devastated. That evening I ate heartily (she almost force-fed me) and fell asleep immediately after. I slept for fourteen to fifteen hours, then got up for work, bringing with me a large breakfast. After all, I needed to get through work severely hungover.I have been aware of the concept "unrestricted eating" (I know some webpage touts "guidelines" for it but it was only this concept I found any grain of truth in) for quite a while, but was always very afraid of the binge-eating risks, but having almost botched my first good job, turned into a semi-drunkard, and nearly smashed my relationship in one go I felt desperate. I set out on what would become a three, maybe four day binge journey like one you have never seen. I have been overeating like crazy, somewhere along the lines of a weeks worth of food over the past three days. It feels as if I ate like a marathon-runner post-contest.My rationale isn't (wasn't?) different from what I had gleaned from the internet. Restriction is nigh impossible for me, and the supposed meal plans or whatnot my dietitian and psychiatrist set up for me only left me hungry and, well , feeling even more restricted. I followed these meal plans for a long time, damn it! They were fishily skeptical about eating any junk food at all as well... The last 1.5-2 years have really messed up my views on food, so in my ire I wanted to hammer into my brain how stupidly simple it is. "It's food, c'mon"! Somehow prove to myself that I am allowed anything I want, at any time, and to illustrate to myself why non-ED people actually keep these things in moderation. I also wanted to hijack my ANs stealthy way of working against my weight-gain efforts.Needless to say I am now feeling the unavoidable anguish and anxiety that follows such an out-of-control experience. I was prepared for it, and hell yes I am ignoring it -- i.e. I am not restricting as a consequence. Been there, done that cycle.But I am at a bit of a loss here, and I was wondering if you out there have any experiences to share on this? Can it work? Should I only keep it to a few days, to let my body restore the damage (n.b. not underweight at all)? Should I eat anything I want at any time or should I rather keep a "solid, healthy baseline" and only go by pure intuition past that point?I know I am taking a huge risk, but as I said I am kind of desperate. Keep in mind that in my country at least, any help you get if you are not underweight is amateurish at best, so I am kind of left to my own devices. This "test" or whatnot is not something I recommend either, the psychological effects are... Tough, but of the kind I can manage. I just seem to have some form of issue with restriction in itself.TL;DR: Restricted for a long time. Still normal weight. Relapsed and almost turned alcoholic, wife found out. Got desperate and tried unrestricted eating for three-four days. Wondering about other people's experience with this.
Twice I have tried to get into IOP programs and both times they have insisted i enter their residential programs. I tell them I can't. I have insurance, but I can't take weeks/months off for a residential care. I have two dependents and a couple months inpatient will leave all three of us homeless. Today I was told they wouldn't treat me at a lower level than they feel I need, despite the fact that this means I get no treatment at all.So how can I find either PHP in evenings in Chicago area or an IOP program willing to help me when everyone is insisting I do residential? If residential is the only treatment they are willing to do, then i can't get treatment? This seems horribly wrong to me. How can they refuse to give me any treatment when i'm finally at a point where i'm admitting i need help? I simply can't go live in a treatment facility for months. Please, please offer me some suggestions!!
I am 24[m] in recovery from AN.I have been in the recovery for 1.5-2 yrs. Originally I was obese then started losing weight due to a change in lifestyle post college, and i continued that trend into a very dark and unhealthy place. I just recently made the decision to stop weighing myself and counting calories/nutrition. It was becoming just as obsessive in my mind as not eating was during my darkest days. I am safely within a healthy weight range again, but i have recently started binge eating to a ridiculous degree. I would like some advice so I wont move from one eating disorder to another, aka anorexia to binge eating. I have difficulties recognizing when I am actually hungry even after a year of eating properly. I am scared of both eating too much and not enough, and i am finally in a healthy enough place mentally to deal with my issues. Maybe some of y'all could help me out with some advice?
At times, I feel ostracized and invalid as the only male identified person in local support groups. I suppose I'm turning to the Reddit community for additional advice, support, etc. Does anyone have any advice for me?
Hi all  My eating disorder could best be described as exercise bulimia, with occasional restriction. I no longer vomit and I've never done laxatives or diuretics, but my health has suffered due to the compulsive exercise -- mostly in the form of disrupted menstrual cycles/amenorrhea. I am not underweight, but I guess on the lower end of normal. On the outside, I look like a fitness fanatic, which blends in seeming normalcy with my (at times self-effacing) perfectionism.My grandmother has been the most stable, supportive figure in my life. She took me in on various occasions while I was growing up when my home environment was just too toxic, and we share a close bond to this day. While I still relied on financial aid and loans, she and my grandfather nearly put me through college and were the home I went to during breaks from school. Needless to say, my gratitude for them and their positive influence in my life is ineffable.However, after two years of struggling with an ED, I had to come clean, and was met with disbelief. My grandmother's reaction was not one of shock or sadness, but... disappointment that still stings. "I don't see how you can have an eating disorder, you just seem like you have it all together." I always felt like being the perfect child was the only way I could pay them back for taking care of me when I had no one else. I graduated a year early with high honors, and didn't want to project to them an image that deviates from that. I always wondered if they would still love me when the confident, ambitious honors student was revealed to be a facade to hide the lowkey depressed, somewhat nihilistic pothead who struggles with an eating disorder and abandonment issues.But even after the cat came out of the bag, lo and behold, despite all that the ED inner voice told me, she still loves me. But her confusion indicated that she doesn't seem to understand how eating disorders work. Example: "I think you should drink less coffee. All that caffeine is probably why your appetite is so poor." While, yeah, coffee is certainly one of my vices and I'll admit to having used it to blunt my appetite... the issue is so much deeper than that. If I cut out caffeine, I'd still be bulimic.I guess the question is if anyone would happen to know any resources -- preferably books over website as she isn't too internet-savvy -- that would maybe enlighten her knowledge of eating disorders, and maybe arm her with the knowledge of how to be a support? I know she wants to help, but I'm afraid she just doesn't know how.
My question for this subreddit is that I saw someone at my in law's parents mushing her food into a paste before proceeding to eat it (chocolate cake). Is this part of an eating disorder? I've never seen an adult act like this at the dinner table and I'm curious to learn more but can't seem to find anything about this behavior. I commented on it at the time and was told to just ignore it, so you don't need to post that kind of answer, thanks!
I've been binge eating for nearly six years, but I'm at a healthy weight. Between binges, I eat healthily, with a caloric deficit that's not huge, but enough to get me back to my previous weight before I binge again. If you looked at all the food I eat in a week, it would look okay. Except that I concentrate all the junk food and a gigantic chunk of the calories into a two-hour window.Since I always promptly lose the weight I gain, what are the other long term effects of binge eating? How does this affect my health? Or is my diet equally as healthy as it would be if I were to eat the same amount of food spread out into sane portions?
Recently it has come to my attention that my water drinking is becoming a problem, and I know that sounds absolutely absurd but I've repeatedly gotten reprimanded at work for how frequently I have to urinate, I haven't slept longer than a couple hours at a time in months because I get up to pee or drink more water, and my family is always complaining about me drinking all the water in the house. I even recently got blood work done and my doctor was concerned because my sodium level was low due to my water consumption. How do I take control of this? I feel really alone in this matter and when I discussed this with my doctor all she said was essentially as expected....drink less water.  But it's soooo difficult to deny yourself something as innately necessary and seemingly harmless as water, but I presume one could say the same for food. I even have trouble eating enough calories because I HAVE to drink a shit ton of water with all my meals, unless it's soup/fruit.The only way I can describe why I do it is for one,  it cleanses your palette, a lot of the time I feel like I need to wash my food down, it helps me swallow, my mouth is frequently dry, I get tired if I'm dehydrated, and....it's....comforting? I feel like I sound insane but it's almost as if I cannot go to sleep without a belly full of water.  I need help because when left to my own devices I drink so much I have difficulty walking. If anyone has any experience with this please direct me how to go about seeking help for this.
I realize ya'll can't diagnose me, but I'd like to know whether there is a possibility.So, I'll start off in sixth grade. In sixth grade was my hospital trip because of dehydration. Before the hospital trip I NEVER drank water (because I hated the flavor). I didn't eat very much. My meals were probably the equivalent of a regular person's snacks. I knew I would get in trouble if I didn't eat at home, so I did. Some nights though, I purposefully said I was full as an excuse to get out of eating. I was obsessed about my body image and weight. I weighed myself everyday, and thought I was fat. I really wasn't though. (I was about 4'10. I realize I can't say weight, but I looked online and for my height, it said I was underweight). I sometimes went on my dad's treadmill, for a long time on a fast speed to try to lose weight. My dad told me to stop, and I did, though doing so felt like torture. In December that year, I had a Kidney Infection due to severe dehydration. I also had severe constipation. In the hospital though, they didn't ask about my diet or whether I was eating enough. Most of the nurses I spoke to told me be quiet because others had it worse. Yes, I know others have it worse, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't get help. They forced me to eat food before I could go home. It was extremely hard, partially because they put IV tubes in my arm that gave me water in my blood 24/7, partially because, well, I thought I was fat. I relented though and finally ate. The next day I got my first period. Right after I got out of the hospital it must have started, because I only got two hours of sleep because I was discharged at like two in the morning. I've always thought that the reason it started right after was because I was given so much water and I was forced to eat and I finally wasn't dehydrated. I'm guessing my period started late though, due to malnutrition, as that apparently happens to some people with eating disorders.The next year after that, my parents made sure I drank enough water. My diet in terms of food was about the same, I mean, I ate a little bit more each meal, and my constipation was not as bad. Since my period started, I gained a lot of weight.Now zoom to now. Now I'm the complete opposite. I've had a few times this month where I've eaten so much food at a time and I feel like I can't stop. I don't vomit after I eat, though. I feel so guilty afterwards that I try to diet, but I can't no matter how hard I try, possibly because I was in the hospital for not eating enough. My eating issues scare me. Could I have had a different eating disorder in sixth grade than in eighth grade?I used to go see a counselor, and when I spoke to them about my concerns involving food and weight, they said that so long as I had an apple each meal (as an example) than that I'm fine. But I don't think living off an apple or just one food per meal is healthy.Thank you for any and all help!
Hello there. 21 male here. My situation has changed quite a lot of times throughout my life, so I'll try to summarise it all in here. I'm not sure if I'll do that, but I can try.Basically, I think I have some kind of eating disorder. I'm not sure how to call it, and fortunately it has never affected my life much enough to cause any serious problems.tl;dr (as a summary - written after the last paragraph appeared): I'm thinking of food all the time, and can't help it!Let's start from the beginning (sorry for any chaos in the text): I always used to be a little bit chubby. This must have been the first reason of my problems. I was never very fat, but always had the biggest belly. In any moment of my life, the fat used to be located on stomach and butt areas and a little bit on thighs, and when I was wearing t-shirt and pants, you would say that I look like a normal, healthy child (as now I'm 21 and so to say well-build and some people even 'expect' me to have a six-pack because of my muscles, and I have never had one).The family of my mom always had a healthy attitude towards food, i.e. some of them were overweight, but never really cared about it too much, never ate too much, they were able to leave some food not touched. My mom's mother cooks just enough portions to make you full, but you wouldn't overeat from what you had on your plate.That was, however, never the case with my father's family. They all love to eat. And it's very typical for them to eat huge amounts of food, especially the comfort food - fat and stodgy. When they finish, they want more, and if there's something sweet to eat - they are always eager. What's funny, most of them look great. They do have some fat - just like me, usually on their bellys - but they also do not care. They all move a lot. The problem however is this stupid attitude - that whenever you end your meal you have to feel STUFFED.Now back to me. I used to spend every weekend at either of my grandparents. The manner was alternating - once at father's family, once at mother's. My family is very kind and loving, which has one serious drawback - they could never say 'no' to my cravings. I could stuff myself with anything that was available, and if there were no sweets they were ready to buy something for me while shopping.I think, that the influence of the father's family had a great impact on me. I always heard 'eat as much as you want'. I taught myself to say that 'I'm hungry' when I had only a small craving for something.Because of the fact I felt unattractive I went to the gym at the age of 16. Had no diet, only tried to eat better (couldn't develop good habits in a house, where the was always something unhealthy), but still changed a little bit. When I went to the new school I was still overweight tough. In the second class (I was 17 or 18) I went on a diet. I did it by myself and despite of constantly stopping it, and then re-starting I lost several kilos, felt much better, and from then I have to say - I am considered as well-build person - with muscles, only some fat, and generally in good shape. Everything's perfect, isn't it? Unfortunately, not.The problems I had with maintaining the diet were the episodes of overeating. For instance, while going to the family (no matter what part) I had problems with controlling myself. When I ate one piece of a cake, I couldn't be stopped. I was able to eat about 10 pieces of different cakes - and even more, but then I had an upset stomach, which 'helped' me to restrain myself.Throughout the next years I lost weight, and gained it. Never became fat anymore, but still not satisfied with my appearance. Started to 'bulk' (gain muscles) than again wanted to 'cut'. I could never decide. I enjoyed eating clean and counting calories, but eventually I was always eating some individual pieces of sweets/sliced meats, and finally I even started to eat things that are not tasty while eaten from the fridge - for example cold (but of course cooked!) potatoes, some leftovers, etc. I am then telling myself, that it's a healthy food, and I need to eat to maintain muscles etc (excuses?)I had a period of time when I was 'cutting' and heard of cheatdays. It was the worst thing that happened to me. I had an excuse to do the 'cheatday' once a week. I used to eat sooo much then, that I'm still confused, how was (and probably still am) I able to do it. Once, after eating the comfort food dinner, I went with my gf (don't have any problems with attraction etc anymore, so it's not the case), and she bought me a pack of cookies 'just for me'. I ate them all. She did it purposively, as she knew I was restraining myself, and wanted to please me while my cheatday (she knew about this invention). Ok, no problem. BUT. I came home and guess what - ate more. I ate the whole pack of crisps as I was not hungry AT ALL. In the halfway I felt bad (stomach), but still ate. I felt like I was gonna throw up (fortunately I never did after overeating).Ok, next problem: again my family. My mom doesn't eat much, so there's no problem. But my father still has those habits from his family home, and he eats everything, what he would like to stuff himself with. When there's a chocolate bar, it disappears in one hour. My brother (15 yo) helps him, mom eats a bit (like a normal person), and I used to eat it too. Right now, I can restrain myself from eating sweets most of the time, but I realised, that I have some sick thoughts like 'I need to eat it, as later there will be none left for me'. I believe it occurred because of those habits from my father's family.As I said, I don't eat much sweets now. I don't eat much pasta, nor bread. Occasionally I eat some sweets or fast-foods. I think it's not too much. BUT. The problem is my mental attitude. Well, three things here: a) when I eat something unhealthy, I feel like there's no sense in restraining myself anymore (the day is already ruined, so why should I bother) and then I eat more and more. I go around the house, looking for unhealthy, and tasty things, even though I now it's overeating now, and I should control myself, but can't. I don't eat too much, as I don't buy it myself (and what my family buys, immediately disappears)b) I DO NOT feel guilty. I look good, and eating too much doesn't change much. But still I know I shouldn't eat when I'm not hungry. And still I do eat. Don't know what to do about it!c) last, but not least - I think of food ALL THE F** TIME. I have exams now. Should focus on studying. Yet, I can focus on it only occasionally. When I'm not sleeping, I'm thinking of eating. That's stupid and makes me feel bad about myself. I think we've finally reached the most important part. I do not enjoy life anymore, as everything I can think of is food. I go to the party - where's the food? Go to the uni - what could I buy myself? I'm dating someone - I want to go home and EAT. EVEN IF I'M NOT HUNGRY. This state started about one-two years ago. Cannot remember when and how. Since last two years just cannot enjoy life. And I do not enjoy eating anymore either.I also think, that I'm kind of trying to stuff my life with eating. However I DO HAVE hobbies, I DO HAVE passions, and still cannot focus on them. When I'm reading, I want to eat. When studying - even interesting things - I want to eat. Crazy. I do sometimes have those moments of relief. Then, I feel like I don't have to eat. I don't care. I'm engaged in some social situation, or doing something that's my hobby. Also in the gym, and right after it (the only moment when I know that I should eat) - I just don't care. When I hear of people who can forget about the meal and therefore skip it I just can't believe it. How is that even possible?Sorry for so long post, I've tried to finally settle it all. Hope that you will understand me, and help. Should I see a psychologist? Maybe someone had got rid of that kind of problem? Please, help!

In my 20s I was bulimic. I got help, and now it only creeps back once in a while. (I'm 50 now.)For about 5 years in the early 2010s I was very poor. I could only afford to eat once a day, was eating very little and not nutritious foods.Today I'm financially in a better place and am eating much better. My problem is that I'm still stuck in a rut with eating once a day. This means I'm eating a boatload of calories at one time. That much food at once makes me want to start purging again.I sometimes see a registered dietician. I've asked her for help but she keeps harping on -what- I eat, not when and how.Please help. I have no idea how to stop this habit and go back to eating like a normal person.
I'm a 22M who's on the border between healthy and overweight. I got up decently far into overweight during college, but have recently been trying to get back down. However, I've been struggling with my diet. I've been so hungry all the time during my diet that I've fallen into a pattern of overeating occasionally, feeling sick, and throwing up. I don't particularly like throwing up, but I feel sick when I overeat and it feels like something my body is supposed to be doing. It doesn't hurt that I usually end up with a lot of free calories for that day while still feeling full, but that's where I'm getting concerned. None of this seems extremely out of the ordinary to me, but my partner has expressed some concern over the number of times I'm nauseous or outright sick in the evenings, and I'm starting to worry. Is this developing into an eating disorder, and does anybody have some constructive mental strategies I can use to head this off at the pass?
I suffered from anorexia for about 4 years. I'm recovered now but I have some lasting side effects from it. This includes hypothyroidism (slow metabolism)- messed up my metabolism from restricting so I have to take medicine for the rest of my life.Also I feel like my IQ has dropped, I have a Masters and Bachelors in Law and used to be really bright and articulate. Now I have a bit of a social stutter and don't feel as sharp; things take a bit longer to do.
I have nothing against food, and I love eating, but I hate the feeling of being full. I also can't eat unless I'm hungry. If I try to eat breakfast, sometimes I'll throw it back up and the other times I feel gross all day. Very rarely will I finish a full plate of food. I eat until I'm no longer hungry and then stop. The problem is that sometimes I won't get hungry for a day or two and won't notice, then I'll eat. i'm "not hungry" which is still not a whole lot so I'm down a full day's worth of calories. Do you guys recognize this or know any tips for combating it? This is the first time I've reached out about it anywhere. I'm a young-adult male if that makes a difference.
I was made unemployed in November.I binge eat every night before sleeping, eating a lot of calories in a very very short amount of time, I eat when i'm not hungry and I feel awful after I do, I tell myself I'm not going to do it but I do anyway.I will literally open pots of cream and custard and just chug them, etc ... whatever shit my mum buys.I need to stop, my weight is ballooning.I'm thinking about going to a doctor but I fear they will tell me that its just willpower in stopping, its seriously an uncontrollable urge, I tell myself i'm just going to get a drink and suddenly i'm eating.How do I stop?
I think I have disordered thoughts about eating. I realised it when I remembered that I never used to think about food this much or feel guilty about eating.I think I've had them for the past few months, but they come and go. For example, if I am busy/hang around with friends a lot, then I can distract myself from having thoughts about what or how much I eat. But by socialising, I end up comparing my body to other people's.And when I'm alone, all the guilt and body-hate comes out and I just want to starve myself, but because of lack of willpower, I never do completely. I think about food a lot - how many calories are in the foods I eat, what recipes I could do, but never do.I try and be healthy - do a couple of workouts a week, walk everyday, try and cook healthy things that I won't feel guilty eating, but I'm lazy so it doesn't always happen. Therefore I end up feeling guilty about not working out enough/eating some junk food. But it's probably a blessing that I'm lazy and lack willpower, otherwise I'd be starving myself.I don't know if thoughts like this are serious or if they warrant some kind of therapy or if I just need to change my attitude to food.
For context, me and my friend (let's call her Allison) are both 15 and haven't been close friends for too long--maybe for a year, and aren't too comfortable discussing really personal things with each other, but I really care about her.My friend has always been the quiet, more aloof and secretive type of person, who never really talks about herself to others. She really admires models, and is constantly on her phone looking at pictures of really, really underweight models and she likes art, and when she draws it's mostly underweight girls. When she's with me or our other friends, she always acts normal, but never really talks about herself; for the past year or so she's stopped eating lunch and instead goes on her phone while we eat. She always critisizes how she looks and about she's too fat (when she's easily underweight) when the topic is brought up but always says "I'm fine," even though we found her with scars from self-harm last year. We brought her to the school counselour, she denys everything and is extremely defensive about everything, and does anything she can to change the topic; visiting the counselor is something I've ruled out as something that can help, especially as she's a really stubborn person who thinks that nothing's wrong, and therefore resents us everytime it's brought up or we try and do something about it. She never actively brings up the topic, either, so I know it's not for attention. It's something we've already accepted we can't change ourselves, so it's been pretty normal for the past couple of months.Today, me and a couple of friends went to hang out for the day and from the morning to the night (~8am-8pm) and she didn't eat a thing. We took some pictures together, and I let her look at them on my phone with the agreement that she doesn't delete anything, and she spends the entire time staring at her arm that she thought was fat in a few of the photos, even zooming in and screenshotting it so that her arm was the only thing in the picture. When I took the phone away from her because she was literally staring at a screenshot of her arm for a long time, she said accused me of breaking our agreement and said "just because I'm not as persuasive as (other friend) doesn't mean you can just push me around like this" when I'm notoriously known as being a doormat and would never have any intentions of pushing her around :(( I gave her back the phone with the agreement that she doesn't send any of the photos to herself, and she promptly distracted me to takes pictures of the photos with her own phone so she could go back home and stare at her supposedly fat arm. Everytime I told her she didn't look fat she responded with something like "Are you saying that what I think doesn't matter?"This day was a bit of a wake up call, because honestly her condition has been at the back of my mind for a while since she always acted normal. But I'm worried again now (on long school days when we go to school at 6am and leave late, she's taken to bringing those small packets of condiments like soy sauce or mustard that you can get at a local store and just eating those for lunch), and I have no idea what I can do as a friend. I'm sorry for the long post, I just don't know what to do and it's really making me worried.**How can I help my friend when I know she won't really open up to me about this?****What do I need to know as a teenager with a friend who may have an eating disorder?**
I haven't had the habit of eating regularly since middle school, and now that I'm kind of trying to get out of, well.. not eating for long periods of time, I have no clue at all where to start with things. It's been years since I would make breakfast in the morning, or make lunch for when I'm out, or make a coherent dinner. I just don't know what to make, or how to make it, or when to make it-- Does anyone have any tips or anything to pick up the habits and stuff?
I've always been a small size my entire life because of my fast metabolism, but my therapist believes I developed an ED a few months ago. The ironic thing is, I love food. I could eat everything in the world and not gain any weight. Recently I've been under a tremendous amount of stress and I haven't been eating. I'm not purposely not eating to lose weight because I'm already very small, I was actually trying to gain weight but eating hasn't been my main priority in the day. They're concerned with my weight because I've lost a significant amount in the last two months. Now since I haven't been eating, I have lost my appetite completely and I get full easily. If I do eat, it's because I know I have to eat at least a little something for the day.I've been trying to put a name to what I have, and my psychiatrist & therapist can't put a name to it either because they don't specialize in eating disorders. I'd just like to start helping myself get better.What can I do to eat enough when I have no appetite?How can I make sure to prioritize eating when I am stressed?Are there professionals or treatment approaches that can help me with this?
I am three years into recovery and have been an extremely picky eater my entire life. Now I am doing great and have healthy eating habits, but know that actually eating a variety of foods is an important step to keeping my body healthy, especially as I get older. I am of course in no way wanting to restrict or change the quantity of my diet, just trying to be more kind to my body! Wondering if anyone has tips on how I can do this? Thanks!
Last year I had a several month long episode of anorexia and bulimia at the time and I am concerned it has permanently damaged my stomach. A lot of times before I eat I get very nauseous and afterwards I remain nauseous. I can't handle too much strong food that is very fibrous, like certain vegetables and smoothies. I usually throw those up involuntarily. Is there any way I can correct this?
Thank you guys! I would love some reading to do in order to better help my little sister, who is currently in treatment for a loss of control (not body image) related anorexia disorder.Thanks so much in advance!Kim
I'm a 24 year old male, and I feel like i might have an eating disorder. I have never had any issues with body image or felt like I was overweight at any point in my life, my problem seems to completely physical. I almost never get hungry. Ive gone days with heavy restriction, and restrict on a daily basis.     I have a lot of stress in my life, particularly over the past year when my problem seems to have gotten much worse. I have lost a scary amount of weight over the past year, which is causing comments and concern.I am seeking advice on how to get help. I want to see a doctor but I'm not sure what kind would be most effective for my problem (nutritionist, psychologist, general practitioner?) I am unsure because my symptoms don't seem to fit the description of a "typical" eating disorder. Any advice will be greatly appreciated!
I made a longer version of this on another site, but, since it says keep posts short, then I'll leave out some details.I have anorexia, and it started in school when I stopped being called the 'skinny' girl (which I'd always been called beforehand.) It hadn't been a compliment, just an observation. But when some other girl started being called the 'skinny' girl, and this stopped, I started restricting my diet.I never got help for my anorexia until last year. I literally begged for help when I first found out I definitely had it. I started reading up on it. I thought I was the only person in the world that had these thoughts and felt that way. Obviously I knew of anorexia, but I had no idea that people had the exact same thoughts that I had.But I was turned away from getting help because I never fit the 'criteria.' I wasn't underweight enough to be classed as anorexic. I was still in the healthy BMI section. It was only last year, around exam time, that I got help. My BMI  was low enough and I was given help INSTANTLY then, like, within the same week. I'd been asking for years before that. It did help, at first.But, even a year later, after being discharged from the ED team, I still have anorexia. I feel as if I will always have it. Food will constantly rule my life. I plan my day around food. I eat the same things everyday at the same time. Whenever the plan is broken, or something comes up, I get distressed and seriously shout and complain at those around me. My 'dinner' is 3pm. I HAVE to eat at 3pm. So much so that I won't stay out after 3pm. I tell friends and family that I have to be home at that time.I've started weighing myself again. The first time I said it was only to see if I was still a healthy weight. Then I weighed myself again to see if I'd maintained the weight, and not put on anything. Now I weigh myself everyday to ensure my weight never changes. I actually get panicky before I step on the scales. I think, 'if I've gained weight, then I'm going to cut out a desert from my dinner,' or, 'if I haven't gained weight, then I can treat myself.'I wish so much that I had never started looking at calories. I'd maintained a healthy weight before the whole thing started, and I'd been eating normally. Now I can't even remember the normal things I used to eat, or when I used to eat. I feel as if I will never be capable of changing my diet, as now I 'know' what I am eating and how many calories I'm consuming. If I change my diet, then I'm so afraid of eating more calories, of instantly putting on more weight.My parents had to hide the scales from me, and whenever they went out of the house I'd tear their room apart looking for them. I used to walk EVERYWHERE, I'd walk miles, just so I could burn off the calories I'd eaten. I don't think this behaviour will ever change...I can't even imagine my life before this thing took over.Is recovery actually possible? Will I ever be able to go through a day without thinking about food? Will I even be able to change my diet and eat normally? How will I cope? Does anyone have any inspiring stories?Sorry, this kinda turned long again, but I just wanted to give some context for my questions.
I'm truthfully just looking for any help I can get please bc I don't even know how to fix this at all. My moms worrying for me for a lot of reasons right now and this ones been going on for so long that idk how to fix it. I don't want to say how old I am bc people will think I'm too young to even be here but only in elementary school now and I know I probably won't even get taken seriouslyl bc I'm not even a teenager yet. But I really need help bc I have a lot of trouble with therapist and don't even know how too talk infront of them at all anyway even.Like I've had it ever since I can even remember. And it's especially dumb for me bc we have this really amazing lady we pay to cook and do groceries for us bc both my parents are doctors at a really big hospital and don't have time. We always have all this truly delicious food she works truly very hard all day makeing for us and I can't even taste it with out needing to throw up. That's how dumb I am.I don't look that sick from it I don't think just really pale maybe. But my doctor thinks it's not letting me grow properly. Like I look the same as when I was 6 pretty much and am not even close to 5 foot yet. And I've been doing dance and gymnastics my whole life and their truly very important too me and I've had to be kicked off 3 times already bc I can't pass my physical bc of this. Which is truly humiliating bc I'm the only person who has this problem in elementary school already.I don't care about the way I look at all. I'm really shy and scared of ppl anyway I always eat lunch in my teachers room. I hate being called pretty which is dumb bc that's a nice thing to say to a girl but not if that's all she hears. Like I hate myself for it bc all of my family are truly amazing ppl like my mom my dad my Oma and Opa are all really amazing doctors and both my older brothers are in premed and actuall medical school already. Like I want ppl to want to be friends with me for being smart or good at something not for being pretty... But ppl probably think that's all I care about bc I'm anorexic but I don't care about it even a little and I work truly very hard at school and my parents even pay for me to go to this truly amazing private school that costs even more than my brothers college which isn't even in this state and costs a whole lot so I can be as smart as them. But I'm not I'm not even smart enough to eat even. And I truly wish I wasn't like this I always have been like that ever since I was 3 or 4 at least. Bc it was so important to my dad that I be really really really skinny bc that's what was gonna make me worthwhile and make ppl like me or not. And would help me hide my food from mom so it looked like I had ate it. Like I would have the lady who cooks for us pack me a lot of lunch and just threw it away before mom picked me up. And then I could just say I wasn't hungry at dinner.But mom dindn't think I needed too bc everyone in are family is really skinny already and we have really good matabolisms and we will be skinny even if we ate. And that being skinny isn't important at all anyway. Like she'd always have real serious talks with me about it bc she worried a ton bc of it but he didn't want me to so I didn't eat but idk how to explain it to mom bc I wasn't allowed to tell her. And he got way worse making sure I didn't eat too much and on the nights mom wasn't there would just r like drag me by the hair to the bathroom and shove his finger down my throat until I threwup. And he just kept doing it every night mom wasn't there. Even when I started not eating anything anymore and he was trying to teach me how to myself so I could even when mom was there but I couldn't and he just shoved my head into the toilet and held it there wich was really humiliating and disgusting but I should of tried harder. And like I never learned how but it got to the point it is now where my body just makes it so I throw up when I just try and eat even if I don't want it too at all anymore.Mom wanted me to see a therapist really badly but dad and me didn't want me too bc I think we were worried about getting caught for the other stuff we have to do together. And like when I was 6 I had done something to hurt myself on accident and mom finally made me see one. But dad told me a lot of things to make me really terrified of talking to therapists. Like even now that I know their probably were all made up I'm still too scared to talk to them even if I really should for my mom. I had to talk to one for 3 times last month bc of trying to of trying to kill myself and couldn't even talk to him by the last time bc I was very scared bc he kept asking me the same questions me and dad had practiced how to answer like a million times and I answered them how I was supposed too even but he just wouldn't let it go at all anyway even tho I answered them the right way even.And like me and my mom thought maybe it would be easier to talk to a girl therapist and she spent like forever finding a really good one for me and I saw her for the 1st time last week and mom even took work off to be there for me but I was so nervous I had done something really dumb the night before and tried to hide it from my mom but ended up fainting there. Her office is right next to the hospital my mom works and idk for sure bc I only woke up for like a real little bit only and I was really very dizzy but I'm pretty sure my therapist who I don't even know yet had to drive me to the hospital so mom could be in the back seat with me and keep me from dying and I haven't asked mom yet but I know she probably hates me for it and won't be my therapist anymore for it. And idk how too even fix myself alone. 
Hello,So about a month or so ago, my girlfriend told me that she used to binge eat and had actually stopped about 10 months ago (we've been dating for 7 months). I didn't really say too much in return, I've known that she was critical of her body but assumed that she'd gotten better and that it was over.However the other day, she saw a picture of herself on facebook that she thought was unflattering and got really upset. She tends to get emotional when she's on her period so that might have been it, but I've never seen her so sad before and it really hurt seeing her like that. I tried explain how I thought she was beautiful (I genuinely do, not only is she beautiful to me, I know that other people think she's very attractive and in all honesty she has nothing to worry about when it comes to weight).I'm still not sure I reacted the right way, but that whole thing got me a little worried about how she's doing with her eating disorder that she used to have. She's been exercising a lot more lately and she counts her macros with an online trainer - she has one cheat meal a week, usually with me, but otherwise she plans what she eats very specifically. I've heard that these can both be signs of eating disorders?I was the only person she's every told about her eating disorder, not even her mom or best friend. I don't think she's ever gone to see a therapist, and I really think it would help. Are there any suggestions as far as1) how to be there for her as her boyfriend - when she gets upset in the future should I reassure her that she's beautiful like I did before or just tell her I love her and be quiety? 2) how to help her to get help - I understand it's not my role to be her therapist or caregiver, but the fact that I'm the only one who knows it's an issue I think puts me in a position where I should try and help her to get help if she's having problems 3) Are there triggering things I can avoid in conversation?Thanks everyone!
When I was 9, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD, and I was put on Adderall. Long story short, nearly every day since my diagnosis, I've taken Adderall. I usually get my prescription filled every month, but because of a mistake made by my insurance company, I won't have Adderall until next week. The day after I ran out, I started having insane urges to eat; I can only describe it as an instinctual urge to eat anything I can lay my hands on.I haven't really had any ED related behaviors in the past, I do count calories and use a food scale (I lost a lot of weight when I was 16). However, I've always attributed this seemingly obsessive behavior to behaviors typically present due to asperger's syndrome, which I have.I'm beginning to think that the appetite reducing qualities of the Adderall have masked an eating disorder, and I've falsely attributed my obsession over calorie counting to Asperger's syndrome. When I get my new prescription of Adderall, I'll reassess the situation, but the possibility of having an ED scares the shit out of me.I want to talk to my parents about it (I'm still in High School), but I'm scared shitless that they'll either brush it off or think I've gone completely mad. l feel like I'm losing control of my body, I'm depressed, I can barely fit into my clothes anymore, and the only friend that I have is currently on a 2 month vacation. I'm at a loss about what to do. Any help? Suggestions? Online Resources? Really, anything at this point would help. Thanks in advance.
Used to be overweight, dieted hard for a year, got anorexia along the way, struggling with satiation.Not clinical anorexia, ED-nos I think it's called (realized today that the term existed), or simply over-restrictive eating.So basically what the title says. Started a hard diet at quite low calories per day at the start of 2015, followed it more or less consistently until jan. this year when I started to realize my relationship with food was down the gutter. I was in a bad place, but reacted quickly to the signs (with some help from my wife), so I did not reach an alarmingly low weight. I am in regular contact with a therapist (she has been relatively helpful; CBT) and have had contact with a dietitian (useless; he told me that I need to eat more and complimented my diet). However, my mind is in a really bad place.Since I am not a dire case I do not get much more help other than in terms of "try to add a sandwich to your dinner" or "try to gain some weight". My therapist has made me aware of some of AN's trickery which has helped a bit, but my anxiety is still very real and very, very strong. I try to eat solid meals every day, snacks in between main meals, but I have issues with knowing how much I should eat, since no one seems capable of giving me guidance on the matter other than "eat more".Certainly the most prevalent issue is that I seem to be unable to feel satisfaction after a meal. Since I eat healthily, quite a lot of lean meat, whole-grain bread, oatmeal porridge, eggs, nuts etc. and am painfully aware of roughly how many calories I consume (compulsive calorie counter - it was my first warning sign) I feel like I'm eating the right amount. My stomach gets physically full, often uncomfortably so, but the feeling of satisfaction never occurs. I have tried all kinds of combinations, even a few careful attempts loaded with saturated fats and sugar, and nothing seems to work. If I eat until I do not want to eat anymore, I easily overeat (or feel like I do - i eat A LOT), and I am still yearning for a snack two-three hours later... I do not want to transform AN into BED, but I still want to eat enough to feel satisfied...So does anyone here at CC have experience with this? Part of my problem is that most information on anorexia and recovery diet-wise (rightfully) concerns dire cases, with individuals that are underweight or even famished. As I do not fall into this category I am at a loss for a recovery strategy. I still experience typical ED behaviour that would likely diminish if I just felt satisfied: wandering around the grocery store daily staring at candy, sweets and treats (or even foods that I usually eat), day-dreaming about food, anxiety in face of ordering out or unprepared meals with friends, incapability to treat myself to "bad" (I know they're not, but you get the point) foods: candy, cookies, cakes, desserts, many condiments or sauces etc... Even though I fight hard and actually eat them. It just seems as if my body will not accept anything less than gorging.I have heard about the "eat whatever whenever" approach but I feel like it's a bit dangerous as I have binged a couple of times before (4 times, 5 months since last time though). Though I have been wondering if I haven't really let my body repair enough; many AN recovery plans involve eating a whole bunch of calories for that purpose, not only for weight gain. That's where my dilemma enters; I do not really need to gain weight, at least not that much, else I wouldn't be that tentative towards just eating more. I want to establish a way of eating that I can carry with me for the rest of my life, so that I don't have to bounce between gaining and losing...Quick info about me in case you wonder: healthy BMI (smack in the middle I think), 25 years old, male. Jogs for a couple of hours a week, works as a CS engineer. I used to lift weights but recently realized it destroyed my self-image so had to toss it. I have nothing against it but I personally can't manage it and stay sane, it seems.Thanks for reading! I can be quite verbose, for which I apologize.TL;DR: Used to be overweight, dieted hard for too long, got anorexia along the way but stabilized at a healthy weight. Can't feel satisfied after a meal despite being healthy. Looking for guidelines for AN recovery when not underweight.
It will be my third time in treatment, her first. She's definitely going to this center, I have another option. We have a six year age difference (I'm older and we are both adults. I'm 25f and she's 18f.) and her ed is related to mine. Mine is (as far as I know) totally unrelated to hers. Would this be detrimental to our recovery? I think it could be good because I never see her (I live in the US, she lives in Europe) and also because family therapy would be much easier. I also think it might be comforting for her because she's never been to treatment before. But, I can also see this going very badly. I would love thoughts and opinions.
I think I may have some type of ED associated with exercise addiction and could use some advice.Due to a developing health condition, I'm unable to complete my former exercise routine, which I have been doing without breaks for many years. I used to be obese and worked really hard to get to a healthy weight, and I'm worried that I will get out of shape.To expand further, the issue is that I count calories and knew how much I ate versus burned off. Now that I can't burn off as much through exercise, and I've been having trouble eating less to compensate, I'm constantly worried that the net effect is a calorie surplus, which will decrease my lean body mass. I often feel like I don't deserve to eat certain types/amounts of food unless I can get a good workout in.To make matters worse, I'm starting to get anxiety with the simple thought of working out. Before I even get started with my workouts, any slight fatigue or body ache and my mind panics; I become anxious that I won't be able to start or finish my full workout and that I'm going to fail yet again. On top of that, when I see other people exercising, I get really jealous and feel guilty that I can't be in their shoes. These thoughts never came into my head before!Has anyone else felt this way before? How do I break out of this vicious cycle?
So recently my girlfriend who is at a healthy weight told me she has bulimia. She said she really didn't want to tell me and has never told anyone before. I've tried to talk to her about recovery but she's convinced that she has it under control. She is a frequenter of pro ED sites (which I made clear that I don't approve of) and she insists that she has it under control. She keeps saying she'll stop when she reaches her goal, (which is unhealthy), that she experiences no symptoms, and absolutely refuses to seek help, recovery, or even begin to change. It's stressing me out beyond and I don't know if I can help her or just give up. How do I get her to realize that she's going to kill herself like this or encourage her to get help?
How do you deal with people bringing up actions in that past that were due to an ED? My friends joke about how I used to eat using behaviors. I've gotten much better about food, but these types of comments always make me anxious, and I can never eat when I'm anxious or stressed. I don't want them to know about the ED.
I have had a love/hate relationship with my body for years now. Sometimes when I didn't like how I looked I would just up the exercise and lower the food. It was never very extreme so I never thought I had a problem. I was very close if not at underweight the entire time. I was always the "skinny" girl and I loved it. It became part of me. My mother would complain about how thin I was and then call my butt too big within the same day. I have no basis for if I am healthy, overweight, or underweight (for me). Only within the past few years have I been "happy" with how I look. I am well within the healthy range now. I got married and subsequently put on "happy weight". I haven't been able to workout like I did because we moved so far away (no gym near). I love that I have boobs now, but that is about it. It changes day by day if I love it or hate it. Realistically I haven't gained much at all, but to me it feels like the world.Days like today I just want to restrict. I just think, well if I restrict for a few days then I will be fine again. I want to be back at the weight I was. My views are so damaged I don't know what body was genuinely more healthy/attractive. I had things I loved/hated about both. How do I get past this? How can I see myself how I am able to see other people? How can I figure our if I actually should lose weight?
A few years ago I was in a bad spot mentally and physically. I had my tonsils and wisdom teeth out in the same month, and was pretty sick. I was admitted to the psych ward for self harm and severe depression two years ago. Around this time I began purging and just barely eating. I saw a nutritionist who wasn't very helpful. Just gave me some pamphlets and said that I needed to gain some weight. At this time I was on the low end of healthy weight. Before all this happened I was pretty heavy).So I stopped purging. I didn't feel like it was an addiction, but I miss it still. Anyway, my doctor and the nutritionist both told me to gain weight. And since then, I've gained and gained. I'm now at my highest weight ever and am classified as obese. I am a pastry chef, so food is constantly on my mind and is a HUGE part of my life.Tonight my mom told me I need to lose weight. I'm so hurt by this. I know that it's the best thing for my body, but I just don't know what to do. Food is my comfort. I'm moving 6 hours away from my mom and everyone I know on Sunday.What can I do?
My 15-year old sister has become way too skinny over the last couple of months up to the point where it's disturbing. After every meal she is complaining about how she ate too much, while in reality she didn't eat much at all. I don't know what to do or say to help her get over these delusional thoughts. I tell her all the time she doesn't eat enough but I don't know if that is the right way to react (it's just my natural reaction). I'd like to know how we as a family (my mom and other siblings) can get her to eat more/workout less (she works out for several hours every day and she even starts crying when we want to go on a holiday because she won't be able to workout for a couple of days) and get a healthy weight/body again. I don't know if that qualifies as an eating disorder but it looks like it to me. Also, something clearly needs to be done.
So about a month-ish ago, I started noticing that my housemate had started making herself throw up some nights after drinking. I thought it was a little concerning, but she was open about it so I didn't think about it too much. Then I started hearing it happen almost every night she went out, and a couple times I heard it during the day. The day thing only happened about 3 times, but it was enough for me to start to really worry, so I talked to her about it and just expressed my concern.She completely denied it, said that she makes herself throw up only when she's drunk because it makes her feel better, blah blah blah. She denied it ever happening during the day, but I literally share a wall with the bathroom and can hear everything. She's a very good liar, but I've lived with her for 3 years and this is completely new behavior. I don't believe her, but I know that you can't force someone to get help if they don't want it. We're both seniors and graduating in a week. She's moving across the country after college, and I'm worried that it's going to get much worse. I feel so helpless. Should I tell her parents? Her sister? Her future housemates? I'm really worried about her, but I don't know what to do.
Hi I wanted to post a message to the subreddit if this is acceptable.I've been over eating for years now, I'm disgusted with how fat I've become and I've got a little boy, and I really want to be able to keep up with him but I'm struggling already.I know I have a problem I accept that. I wanted advice on how to get help/ things I can try to make things better. I eat in secret, I'll try and grab bits of food when people aren't looking, finish up my partners leftovers when cleaning the dishes,. Grabbing a pasty when I get the milk on the way home. I know simply put I need to stop eating, but I eat without realising it. I'll be half way through something and realise what I'm doing. I feel like a scavenging dog like I have to eat.If anyone has any suggestions if be delighted to hear. I'm trying to think before picking up food, but any tips would be really appreciated.

I'm slowly working on increasing my food intake and I've noticed I get really nauseous after I have a "normal" meal or snack. Of course, this makes me not want to eat because I feel crappy afterwards and it's making it more difficult to get myself to eat something...Has anyone else experienced this and does it eventually go away?
Hi, I have never been officially diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder which has been ongoing for years. I have always had a very negative body image, constantly feeling fat and unattractive, however never really lost substantial amounts of weight.Last summer I got it into my mind that I was going to lose weight, and started using myfitnesspal to track everything I ate and every bit of exercise I did. At first I seemed to have a normal relationship with it but it quickly developed into an obsession, to the point where I would severely restrict for days after I ate even a little over the minimum recommended calories, and I wouldn't eat back any exercise calories. I starting running frequently and walking everywhere. At the time it didn't feel like that much of a problem because I felt I could easily maintain it, and I was losing weight very quickly. Between August last year and January this year I dropped significant weight, and I was never huge to start with. I am very short (4ft11) and started at a BMI just over "normal" and now have a slightly underweight BMI.I started to realise something might be off when I started getting dizzy and developing huge surges in my anxiety, and experiencing feelings of depression/suicide regularly. I kept having panic attacks and not really being able to do anything. Thoughts of food, exercise and weight have consumed my mind and I am so scared that I will gain weight if I lose control.I forced myself to stop tracking calories a couple of weeks ago, and I have also stopped running because I felt it was only making it worse. I think I am getting better but I am so scared to gain weight. I know this makes me sound crazy, but I am not a vain person, I just don't know why this suddenly bothers me so much.I also have huge anxiety issues relating to doctors/medical staff/anything to do with hospitals or doctors surgeries. I have had unrelated medical problems for years (very personal problems) and have had very bad experiences with doctors. My boyfriend forced me to go to the doctor a few weeks back and they booked me into appointments for blood tests, but then I got letters saying they had to cancel them and I had to go back and re-book :( I just can't bring myself to go back and get help for it.I guess what I am wondering is what are the best ways to overcome the obsession when you're afraid of gaining lots of weight? I keep getting slight urges to binge eat, but nothing of a huge problem at the moment. The dizziness and anxiety is going as long as I eat more, but I also feel like I am eating too much. I am still stuck in my past 'chubby' junk-food loving mindset, whilst simultaneously struggling with being underweight. I don't know what to do. I feel so silly for feeling like this.**How can I recover normal eating without resorting to binges or freaking out?****What can I do to keep my anxiety under control while trying to get well again?**
I've been purging, not after every meal, but after really big meals for the last ten years (about 2 or 4 times a month). I know have stopped this behavior since December of last year and I feel I'm finally getting over it.But now I'm suffering from acid reflux and heartburn, and I have extremely strange bowel habits. These are the main reasons I stopped purging as I thought they might be linked to that. I have a very sensitive digestive system, meaning that I poop about 5 times a day (normal, no diarrhea) and I feel the need to go to the bathroom whenever I eat something. I think I might have IBS, which only started about two or three years ago.The acid reflux is pretty bad too. I'm in pain almost every day unless I take a Nexium or something similar.I've had two endoscopies in the last year and the doc said everything was fine, there was nothing wrong with my throat, esophagus or stomach. He just asked me if I had puked recently (which I had). Now I'm thinking that maybe I should get a colonoscopy.My question is, could these "symptoms" be related to my vomiting? If so, will I get better now that I've stopped?
I've been in recovery from AN and overexercise since 2010, and my eating has improved a lot, but I still have a horrible relationship with exercise.A little background: all the members of my family are extremely athletic and active, and somehow I feel like I didn't get that gene or whatever. I've never enjoyed exercise at all, though I used to play some sports very casually as a kid. Once the ED hit, it started as "be healthier!" as usual, including exercising more often, and then spiraled quickly.I've been pretty much weight restored in the "healthy" BMI range for the past 5 years, but the ED thoughts and urges are always still there and I still go to therapy and stuff. I haven't exercised in the entire time I've been in recovery, mainly because I just don't feel the need or desire to, and when I force myself to do it, all the negative feelings come back. Even things as simple as walking make me start to obsess over calories and numbers and stuff. I never feel better afterward, and a lot of times if I do anything extremely aerobically strenuous, it's so painful both physically and emotionally that I honestly feel like I'm going to die.My medical doctors (who specialize in ED) have all told me it's okay not to exercise, and with this recommendation plus my own... lethargic nature..? it seems pretty straightforward.The problem comes in with my family and the rest of society. My family is always urging me to exercise and basically telling me that I'm lazy for sitting on my ass all day. It's been like this since I was a kid, and I won't deny that it contributed to a lot of my ED problems at the time. I don't literally sit all day; realistically, I get up and do chores, play with my dog for a bit, send my younger sisters to their extracurricular activities and all the like. I just don't "work out" like the general population does, and I'm definitely not active compared to the rest of my family. And for some reason my family thinks that's unacceptable. And on top of that, we're flooded by the media with all the ~benefits~ of exercising and stuff, and I've been trying to use tools from therapy to resist the urges and help myself when I get triggered, but it's hard.I don't have any medical issues that aren't caused by ED, if that's of any relevance.I guess my question is, are you guys at a point where you can exercise? How much do you think it depends on your own nature and personality and inherent energy level? Is it okay not to feel the need or desire to exercise?
My girlfriend of >1year currently has a full blown ed. I have always been very careful about how I talk to her about the subject, but tonight I accidentally and unintentionally made her really upset by commenting on someone else's body, and I should have seen it coming but I didn't. She tricked me into talking about it and the person actually looked ok and normal, but in my girlfriends eyes she looked skinnier than her (which is not true), which made her upset because she now thinks she looks completely healthy and normal and "not skinny" enough to even think about recovery. She completely lost trust in everything I say and thinks anything is a lie just to defend myself or comfort her. I feel absolutely horrible. How do I regain her trust and comfort?
Sadly, I let my frustrations get the best of me and I said things that hurt my girl, things that I read in the FAQs that I should never fucking talk about but I did. I should have been a better man but I let the ED be the focus of our relationship and she hated it. She hates it that I talk about it with her. It frustrates me that I can't talk about it with her but now I realize that I am not her doctor and that I am her boyfriend, her best friend.If any of you have ever been hurt by your SO and have argued before regarding ED, could you please chime in and give some advice? How can I make things better? Please tell me I did not destroy our relationship...
I've been purging excessively -I normalized it but the doctors said it was a severe amount- for three years (huge weight fluctuations of about 7 in BMI in a matter of two months and it's just gross). I was diagnosed last year, but I've gained weight (being monitored) and my bmi is around the upper end of "healthy". I feel like I can't be sick anymore since I weigh so much, and the only way I can seem to self-validate what I'm struggling with is to purge more. Any advice?
This is a crazy scenario. So my therapist and I are tight. Like more than therapist-patient tight. I've actually worked in her office SPECIALIZING IN eating disorders despite the fact that I've had an eleven-year eating disorder. I'm good in this population, no denying it. The thing is my therapist has had a past of ED's (honestly at this point most therapist's who specialize in ED's have had one at some point) but she has clearly relapsed. Emaciated and so very triggering. And unfortunately my coworkers at the time confirmed it. She's getting worse.How am I supposed to take the advice of my therapist about treatment when she's the one who needs to be in there herself? Because we're so close, do I just bring it up? That might ruin the bond we have. But I feel it has the potential to be destructive and I give her excuses because she's had my back for this job and stuff. I'm lost. Any advice is welcome.Please notify /u/hellofriendsitsme when you respond
One of our readers suggested [this article](http://eatingdisordersreview.com/nl/nl_edr_19_3_1.html) by a Professor at University of Iowa, Iowa City, might be helpful to some of you. It distinguishes between Purging Disorder and other forms of eating disorders
I don't eat regularly enough. I never have any energy as a result of it, but I have a hard time convincing myself to eat on a regular basis, because when I do, I gain weight. I'm already overweight, I don't want to become obese. I have a bad lower back that prevents me from doing as much exercising as I would like. I'm feeling really stuck. Anyone have experience with something similar, and/or have advice on what I can do?
I'm a 21 year old university student who has had a lifelong struggle with food. Things really started to go downhill in high school, but never enough to do anything about it. Then when I moved away to university, especially after 1st year when I had to start cooking for myself, things fell apart even more.I think about food all the time, but not in a good way. I skip meals, then eat a lot. I seem to either restrict, or go completely the other way and eat bad food and often lots of it. I'm very overweight, and trust me, this isn't my opinion. I've always been overweight, but I've ballooned since starting university.My problem is, a very close friend of mine is recovering AN. Her case is quite "textbook". But my... whatever it is doesn't seem to match anything. But I feel that this is fallen into ED territory. But some meals, and even as much as a day, I can be pretty fine and not have the thoughts. Does that negate a possible ED? I feel like to be able to recover I need to own whatever this is, but I'm worried if I use the term ED, they won't believe me, take me seriously. Especially since I'm good at hiding it, and not even remotely skinny. I told my mom when I first asked for financial support to start therapy two years ago, and she outright denied what I said, even as I was sobbing to her after getting the courage to tell her.Sorry, that was really wrong, I'm just super conflicted and having a lot of trouble. I need to start to do something, as if I continue on this path my weight gain will be incredibly harmful to my health, but I feel like I can't go forward if I don't figure out what I'm up against.
Hello all. This is my first time posting, just recently found this subreddit and thought it would be a perfect place to ask about this.I was anorexic for about 8 years, from middle school until my early 20s. It got to a point where I wouldn't eat for a few days at a time, especially when I started living alone where no one could track my eating. I started fainting somewhat frequently and that's when I realized that I was doing some major damage to my body. The turning point for me was not eating for a few days and then going to a pool party where I was in the Texas sun for hours. On my way home, I fainted while driving and ended up totaling my car on the freeway. Thankfully no one was hurt, but it was a huge wake up call that I needed to change my relationship to food.I finally recovered after a big move to another city and a boyfriend who loved me dearly and helped me see the error of denying myself food. I gained quite a bit of weight while I was with him but was still a somewhat healthy size. Once we broke up, I went on a binge of emotional eating and drinking almost every night and that really caused me to gain a lot of weight. Eventually I gained so much that I realized I really needed to make a changeI started by just eating healthier with a healthy weight loss calorie count,  but I started getting back to disordered eating as I would only eat about half of what would be a healthy weight loss diet. It slowly devolved into a more and more restrictive calorie intake. I feel some sort of satisfaction from eating less than I had the day before.My question is how do I get into a diet regime to safely lose weight without beginning to restrict myself in an unhealthy way? I really thought that I had overcome the eating disorder but once i start to track calories, it's really difficult to not go back to the old ways of thinking of slowly eating less and less.I'm not sure if therapy is the only way to solve this or if there are things that I can do on my own to help guide me into a sustainable eating plan. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
So recently I've been working out more and I love the effect it's had on my life - I'm happier, more productive, crazy sex drive, etc. Another great effect is that I'm losing weight naturally; I'm almost close to the weight I was at when I was suffering from anorexia/BED a few years ago.My concern is that I want to keep losing weight. I like how I feel in my body and feel like I would be happier at a slightly lower number (I'm well within the healthy BMI range now, nothing scary). But I'm afraid going lower will trigger old disordered habits.Has anyone done this successfully? Is it even possible to avoid old habits when doing this? I don't want to trigger myself but... I want to be leaner and in prime shape. Any advice is welcome :)
My sister binges on large quantities of food more than once a day. She's been doing this for quite a while, 2 years I'd say at the least. She's skin and bones, yet she eats to the point of being so bloated she looks pregnant. Then, once she is able to feel like she can move again, all she does is walk on the treadmill. Her health is in a severe decline, with her hair falling out. I also believe she doesn't menstruate, at least normally, and she's told me she wears a diaper because she can't control when she goes to the bathroom sometimes. She's incredibly frail. She has poor body image and depressive thoughts. I believe this all started when he ex cheated on her, though she had underlying issues before that. She also experiences Celiac and potentially other dietary issues. She sees doctors on occasion but never mental health professionals to my knowledge. She'll say she wants help, yet refuses to see anyone, sometimes cancelling appointment after appointment with her doctors. Basically, I feel like someone in her situation would be seeing doctors frequently to get it figured out, not once every few weeks.TL;DR: I believe my sister has severe BED/EDNOS. How do I get her the help I need without upsetting her or putting her in a space where she feels like my family and I are "out to get her"? Please help.
I've tried to keep this as short as possible as per the sidebar guidelines, so I apologize if this is a wall of text because there is some history, but here we go: I've been seeing a therapist for the last year and she referred me to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with BED. I've finally come to the point of acceptance and am gathering all the information, tools and support I need to recover. I'm going to continue seeing my therapist, requested an appointment with a dietitian, and I am waiting for a group BED class that my insurance covers but will not start until the middle of June. Walking out of the psychiatrists office, I felt like I've been ignoring a problem that has been staring me at the face for so many years, and I cannot stand to wait another day to start recovering.I feel confident and motivated to start this process and I think I have all I need to overcome this. But there is one issue that I see repeatedly mentioned but with no explanation about how to handle this while recovering from BED: co-occurring substance abuse.Last year when I settled into a new comfortable job and home, I made a conscience decision to "get healthy." I quit smoking cigarettes after 10 years of being a smoker. I wouldn't say I'm completely "smoke-free" since I smoke socially now and again. I'm satisfied it's not an every day thing anymore. Then there is marijuana, which I have been using almost daily for the last 8 years. When I quit smoking cigarettes, of course my marijuana intake went up because I just "had to smoke something." Whether it's marijuana or tobacco, I know I'm addicted to smoking. It's worth noting I'm not much of a drinker. I do drink socially when invited to, but the truth is that I'm a tank so when I do drink, it inevitably leads to binging. This happens only about once or twice a month, if at all.What I've discovered is that my BED and my substance abuse are interrelated in that I believe I've been using food and substances to mask my emotions or other underlying issues. But when it comes to recovery, I find myself in a dilemma and I find myself swaying between two approaches and I cannot figure out which one is right for me. The dilemma is this: I'm thinking of going sober all at once so I can fully address my BED, but I've found that in the past, where I address "one at a time" then use of the other substances or binging increases.Many say "don't quit too many vices at once," and to take them on one at a time. I've been doing that with tobacco in my efforts to "get healthy" and when I quit smoking tobacco, I gained weight because I was binging more. Thus, quitting substances will exacerbate the binging. On the other hand, I don't think I can fully address my BED without quitting marijuana because marijuana doesn't make me binge, but it makes me lazy and reduces my awareness. Quitting drinking I know I can do since I don't do it much anyway. This all leads me to question whether going completely sober (no smoking anything or drinking) is the answer so that I can recover from BED with full awareness, but this is exactly what is commonly advised against.My question for you fine people of Reddit is if anyone has gone through and eating disorder and substance abuse, whether it's drinking or smoking? How did you handle it? Did you tackle the substance abuse first or the ED? Did you do both at the same time? Did you go completely sober? What kind of treatment did you seek? What was/wasn't helpful?Please, I will appreciate any and all light shed on this issue since I feel like I've dug myself into a hole. I believe I can make it out, I would just like some insight/encouragement before the next time I see my therapist.Thank you and much love <3
I am in my early 20s and have recently "recovered" from Bulimia. I say "recovered" because I have not purged since my initial decision to stop about 3 months ago. I have had a full blown out eating disorder since my late teens, but can think of occasions as young as middle school where I showed ED tendencies. I still remember the first time that I ever purged, I was a sophomore in high school. I had been fasting, going into my fourth day, and couldn't take it anymore. I ended up eating more than half of what was in the fridge. Afterwards, I felt so disgusted with myself that I curled down on to the title floor of the kitchen and just started balling my eyes out. The combination of dry heaving, hiccups, and a full stomach made me throw up. Afterwards, I decided that this would be my solution for managing my weight.This was a very effective way for me to stay "skinny". Mostly because I purged everything like keeping it down would poison me. Although I looked fine on the outside, I always felt like crap. Whether it was because I'd plan my life around my binges (which always managed to inconvenience me), or because I was constantly tired and dehydrated from purging, or because I couldn't go out for dinner with friends who were unaware because I had lost all idea of what a normal person ate like. The reasons why I felt like crap where endless.Finally, I decided to end this way of living once and for all. The only thing I was gaining from this disorder was the fact that I wasn't gaining weight. The cons finally outweighed that one pro. It has been three months now, and I feel much healthier.I'm still very early in the recovering phase, so I was wondering if anyone could answer me a few questions.When does the weight fluctuation stop?Also, how do you explain the fluctuation of weight and take the sometimes hard criticism of others noticing weight gain?I went from a small to a small-medium. I know that I am not overweight, but thicker than I was before. It's so difficult for me to hear people make comments about my weight gain, even jokingly, because for a normal person this wouldn't be so harsh. Also, I am a bikini bartender, so the slightest loss/gain in weight goes noticed by the staff & regular customers.Any advice anyone could give me would be so much appreciated, I really feel like I'm all alone on this.Also, how do you explain the fluctuation of weight and take the sometimes hard criticism of others noticing weight gain?I went from a small to a small-medium.

I'm a 21 year old male who has struggled on and off with Bulimia since my mid teens, and with drug and alcohol abuse. I am currently in recovery (with occasional slips, I'm not perfect) from my addiction to drugs and alcohol, but I'm afraid that my bulimia is coming back. My drugs of choice were mainly stimulants, MDMA, Meth, DXM, Adderall, etc. Now that I'm abstaining, I've noticed that I have started binge eating. At first I thought it was just withdrawal, but it's been a couple months and I still struggle with knowing when to stop eating, and with massive cravings for certain foods. One of the reasons I liked stimulants so much was they kept me from having an appetite, kept me thin. At first I was just binge eating, but in the last couple weeks I've started to purge. Not all the time, only once or twice every couple days - but I know myself, and I know it's going to snowball. I don't want to deal with Bulimia again, it's something I'm very ashamed of and secretive about. I have that thought that because I'm a male I "shouldn't" struggle with this. No one knows about my secret habit, and I'm awful at asking for help, because I'm afraid people will just think I'm looking for attention. I want help though, and I thought the internet might be a good place to ask for it because of it's inherent anonymity. Sorry for the TL;DR, just had to get this off my chest. So... yeah. That's my story, I guess.
I realised that I'd lost a bit of weight when I stepped on the scales at home in January - going from a borderline underweight/slightly-healthy weight to underweight. I put it down to eating healthier at home. From that day, I started weighing myself multiple times a day and calculating my BMI everyday because I wanted to see the numbers go lower. And I'd calculate how much I needed to weigh to become more underweight.Then I went to study abroad and I haven't been able to weigh myself anymore because I don't have scales, and due to several work deadlines I was distracted from my weight. I didn't really realise that I was quite skinny until some people asked me if I had lost weight. Then I actually looked at my body and noticed I had in fact lost weight. I felt proud of myself for unintentionally losing weight because I've never been happy with my body, even though people say I'm slim. I think that weight loss was down to stress - because I got a lot of other stress induced symptoms during that time.However their comments and the weight loss has just made me want to continue losing weight because I still feel fat, even though people say I'm not. And now that I'm less stressed, I'm scared to put on weight again. I did binge-eat twice but then felt guilty so since then I've been counting calories and limiting my calorie intake to a level which I thought was safe for weight loss - but according the recommended calorie intake chart on the sidebar of this subreddit, I'm vastly undereating (even though I don't feel really hungry). I really don't want to eat more calories though. When I eat anything remotely unhealthy or when I eat until I feel full then I feel guilty, and I've started to enjoy the feeling of being hungry because it means that I'm losing weight. This past weekend I spent hours looking at food recipes, I don't even know why.I'm going to visit my boyfriend for two weeks and I know we'll end up cooking/eating foods which are so unhealthy. I feel conflicted because half of me wants to eat the food that I used to enjoy and love eating but the other half of me doesn't want to put on any weight.I think my thoughts relating to food and weight loss have become unhealthy, is this true? I don't know what to do, and if they continue will it lead to an eating disorder?
I am very concerned about my housemate. He and I both started a degree in Spain last year, its just the two of us living together. He has developed pretty serious Bulimia. The situation is difficult because neither of us speak great Spanish and live in a fairly isolated group of foreign postgrads.We became good friends pretty quickly, close enough that I have been able to talk to him about it a bit, but that generally just results in him being sneakier when he does his vomiting. I feel like action needs to be taken because the guy has become seriously weak (still goes running all the time despite having no energy), basically doesn't sleep and has already failed 5/6 subjects. On the other hand I can't make him see somebody or take action in some other way. I feel like the school / his family need to know but he has also cut himself up once pretty badly and I am not 100% sure that me telling the school or family wouldn't result in serious self harm.What the hell do I do? I feel particularly responsible because the whole thing seemed to get a lot worse because I started excising a lot and taking my diet more seriously. I think he has developed some sort of gay infatuation with me and wanted to "keep up", I know that sounds very self absorbed but its my opinion when trying to be as impartial as possible. I bring it up only because it effects the way I am able to talk to him without eliciting extreme emotional reactions.
My request mentions a time when there was a senior meeting at my school, and there was a woman there that said she can assist us in problems with our home lives and relationships, but I don't know her name or job title. I wanted to ask my guidance counselor if she knew who the lady was, and if someone here has spoken to a person like that and if eating disorders is something I can talk about with that lady, like if that counts. Is she called a school therapist do you think?
Every now and then (once a week or so) I'll eat to the point where I get overwhelmingly nauseous and then I'll deliberately induce vomiting. On rare occasions, I'll actually go to multiple restaurants in one day and eat in between visits to each restaurant. I'm slightly overweight and I am self-conscious about it, but it's not why I do it really.The problem is, I absolutely cannot stop eating certain foods I feel are unhealthy. I've tried to avoid them, but I always come back to the foods that give me the greatest comfort in the short term. Then I end up feeling really ashamed, but I rarely actually induce vomiting. Only when I feel nauseous do I do that, but that happens frequently do to just the sheer amount of food I eat. The problem is, I feel really good after I vomit. Like, really really good. But yes, I do eat to the point where I'm ashamed of myself very frequently.I'm seeing my therapist this Thursday. Is this something worth bringing up with them?
Having struggled with BED and EDNOS since I was around eight years of age, I feel your pain. Here's what's helped me in my road to recovery: Reading material: "Life without ED" by Jenni Schaefer "Food: The Good Girls Drug", "Full" by Kati Simpkins, and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Workbook (used after having gone through CBT with a therapist). Other helpful things: finding something else to occupy your anxious thoughts. When I first decided to go into treatment, I had my roommate teach me how to knit. I knew that my anxiety and my ED would be screaming at me, so I figured if I had something to do with my hands that didn't involve giving into ED, I might be able to not binge as frequently. I also found a therapist that specialized in disordered eating. She's helped me to use tools like food logging, and working on body positivity with myself. Instagram, oddly enough, has also been a huge help. I started going on there to find others who were going through recovery in order to get ideas as far as healthy eating habits, healthy foods that help with wrangling BED (serving sizes, pre-prepared,etc), and with a positive outlook for recovery.I think the hardest part with having an eating disorder, for me, has been being honest with myself and others on how I'm doing. ED makes things so hard to perceive sometimes, so I've learned to practice more translucency with how much my ED affects my daily life. If I hold myself accountable for how it influences me, and share my struggle with others, I hope that in time that vulnerability will help me to see that I'm going to get past this, I'm going to be fully recovered someday, and that in the meantime, I just have to take every day as it comes.
Hi, I'm recovered but I still have a hesitate towards food. I don't count my calories I just eat whenever I'm hungry. My mother who wasn't very supportive during my recovery because of my ''weight loss success''. She is suddenly extremely overbearing with making sure I eat enough. She monitors what I eat; she counts how much calories, Sodium, Protein, Calcium I eat. I know she has good intentions, but it makes me feel very overwhelmed and stressed out. since I am not comfortable with getting into counting what I eat territory. She feels like she's helping me but it makes me feel closer to relapsing. I've told her but she ignores me and seems to think she's doing the right thing. What do I do?
I am in the normal weight range for my age (early 20's) and have a healthy relationship with food. A year and a half ago, a very close friend took his life. Since then, I often find myself making myself sick on purpose when I feel particularly upset. The sadness is often about my friend, but could be as little as a stranger being rude to me on the street. Right after my friend passed, I would make myself sick at least a couple times a week. Purging makes me feel better. Now it only happens two or three times a month, but lately it's been increasing again. Not sure if this qualifies as an eating disorder or how I should approach it. I don't have depression or anxiety, but I do tend to get upset easily. Is this something I should talk to a professional about, or is it okay to just leave it be and assume it will go away on its own? 
I started seeing my therapist about 4 months ago; I had started having some issues with restricting again. One of her specialties is eating disorders. Recently it's been getting warmer where I live, and in the past few weeks she has been wearing things that have made me notice how extremely skinny she is. Like not normal skinny; I've been to Ed treatment in the past so I've seen a lot of sick people, and now that I pay more attention it honestly seems like she may be having Ed issues of her own. Should I even try to bring this up? Or should I just find a new therapist? I feel like it's such a touchy thing to bring up. Not to mention she has made comments hinting at the fact that she has had her own issues with an eating disorder in the past. Any advice helps!
Short background: I’m concerned about a male friend. He a colleague from the university, we had classes together for a year but we only talked a couple of times so we’re not really close. I noticed he lost loads of weight and looks really bad now. This plus many other ED-typical symptoms. A little bit about me: I too suffered from ED (AN). I’m recovered as much as it’s possible, I’ve been eating normally for years, no major relapses.I really want to talk to him. The problem is, I don’t know what to say to him to not do any harm. I remember that when I was at my worst, on one hand I really wanted someone to come and talk to me and offer me their support. On the other hand, whenever anyone cared, I rejected them. Actually, rejecting people was giving me a huge satisfaction. It made me feel strong, because I had the feeling I didn’t need anyone, that I was above feelings and emotions, that I could control them. And then, I restricted my diet even more. Moreover, I couldn’t stop thinking “they only care when you lose weight, otherwise they never give a sh*t, you should go on with the diet”, or “it means that you lost weight, you’re doing well, you’re closer to your goal, you should go on”. Later on, when my AN got more serious, after talking to someone ‘concerned’, I would allow myself to eat more than usually, which then would almost immediately lead to panic, shame, self-disgust, self-hatred, exercising more to burn the additional calories, more self-hatred and eventual decision to avoid the person who threw me off my inner “balance”. Because in the end, any form of interest was too overwhelming for me to handle, so I perceived it as a threat.I don’t really know what to do so for now I stay away. On every single site about ED they say that you should offer support to the sick person. But honestly, how do you do it? I cannot come up with a single sentence that wouldn’t have backfired if I had heard it during my ED period. I recovered only when I, myself, made the decision that I don’t want to live this way. Until that point, every single help offer, support, or concern led only to further diet restriction and isolation.So: what, from your perspective, a third person can realistically do or say that will not make things worse (i.e. won’t lead to hostility, isolation, even more restrictive dieting)?

I am worried about my friend. He only eats when he realizes he's hungry, and sometimes he doesn't even realize it. Yesterday, he ate normally and he's not concerned about his weight or his body image, so I do not think he is anorexic. He just doesn't eat enough, and when he does, he avoids certain textures. Could he possibly have ARFID? I've looked into it, but I'm just not sure because it doesn't seem like he actively avoids food (just when he isn't hungry).Should I be concerned? Is there anything I can do?edit: The user of this post has asked you to please respond to them directly: /u/Zubat_Breeder
My best friends father passed away around 2 months ago. It was very sudden, a heart attack; he was young. My friend was obviously really upset. 1 month after, she told me she was going to be vegan. This came out of NOWHERE. she hasn't ever expressed any interest in the idea. She also she kept this a secret until i figured it out and asked. She has a slight history with restrictive eating and bad body image - should i be concerned? 
I'm writing about a close friend of mine who used to be overweight and always had confidence issues about their body. Over the summer they started to undereat with the goal of reaching a normal body weight.Around December this started to pay-off and they reached a healthy body weight, however, that's where they started to continue counting calories. Supposedly due to a very controlling mother that would force food onto them.This trend has continued over the past few months, and right now they are underweight and up until last week were still justifying undereating with a plethora of reasons. However, recently, due to a few social eating days they started severely restricting their calorie intake and started to complain about ED related maladies.Ever since last week I've been trying to support them, by talking about it, and being judgment free. However, recent days have made me extremely worried, and since I'm close to them this is affecting me and making rational thought and being supportive difficult. Which is why my question is two-fold:What are methods for detaching from being worried and being able to be supportive while they do not wish to acknowledge they have a problem at all? For unrelated reasons they will probably see a psychologist soon, and I have some hope that this might get the ball rolling. but I'm not sure whether they will be really open to the psychologist on account of being ashamed.When it comes to physical health, how dangerous is their current state? I only recently started to read into EDs and I have no idea what the impact of restricting while being borderline underweight does. More specifically, is this a point where immediate medical attention is necessary? If not, what are indicators that they are at that point? 
After experiencing drastic weight loss from a depressive episode, I noticed that over the months, I developed an intense fixation on my eating - what I've been eating and how I've been eating. I started obsessively listing down the food I ate daily and being hyperaware of my portions. I also started designating almost completely arbitrary "bad" and "good" labels to the food I encounter, and punished myself in my head for eating the "bad" ones. For a period too, I couldn't stop counting calories. Some days it gets really bad and tiring for me to think that I end up crying or wanting to cry in the middle of doing something unrelated. Apart from the huge amounts of guilt, I feel like I've lost control of my body, and it makes me think like I don't know my body anymore. I am aware that these are alarming signs and I should probably consult a therapist, but at the same time, I have been eating regularly now, and have been experiencing those symptoms "less" now, so I think I've been recovering, and am not sick enough to warrant a checkup.However, I've noticed I'm also hostile and afraid of what I think is entailed by recovery - increasing my frequency of eating, potentially increasing portions, the "healthy" weight gain. I eat with more ease now, but I still have bouts of guilt and fixation, and I still get extremely afraid of weight gain and sometimes even get frustrated at myself for wanting to get better. Help?
I purged again last night. It'd been a long time since last. I saw some pictures in /r/cosplay and realized that my body will never look right. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.I haven't been able to meet with my eating disorder therapist in a while because I lost medical assistance. It's typical for people who are on disability to lose it. I'm on medicare which covers much less.So I'm kind of just here. With a terribad headache my eating disorder screaming in my ear that happy or sad thin is better. Eat shit feel like shit.All sorts of... I'unno. Propaganda. I hate my eating disorder. I want help. I want a community where I can talk about feeling trapped in a skin that's wrong. I. I can't control so much of my life right now. Food is all I have. And I feel really bad whenever I listen to it. It sucks but it's all I've got.Can anyone offer advice on what I can do?
For as long as I can remember, I have been the pickiest eater. There are only certain foods that I like, mainly my mothers cooking and a few other things but for the most part I feel disgusted when I attempt to eat anything else. I don't like 90% of meats, I don't like vegetables and I don't like any fish, there isn't really much else for me to eat. I really don't like being picky with my food and I would like to try new things but as soon as I eat them I just feel completely disgusted. Is there anything I can do?
Hello friends. My friend has severe Aspergers, this makes it hard to reach him. He just doesn't get how dangerous it is. He has lost a significant amount of weight in a short time. What he considers enough for a day is barely a breakfast. Now he's at a high risk underweight that is tearing me apart. He's not suffering from a classic ED, he just doesn't care. I'm quite sure he wants to die but doesn't get it himself. He says there's nothing emotionally wrong with him because he's unaware of his feelings. He has been diagnosed with depression and is now on antidepressants. I'm sure it won't do any good but it's something.He's been going down a bad spiral the past months, self harm that is escalating and loosing more and more weight. I'm his only friend, the only one he talks to and i am tearing my hair out trying to explain the dangers. Please, help me to explain the dangers to him of not eating and underweight. Sites that are legit with good information. Studies, references, explanations, anatomic changes. If i can't make him understand, he will die and it's scaring so much.
I still workout a lot but have gained weight in recovery over the past 6 months. I am still gaining weight by eating a sufficient number of calories a day to do so. I workout because even before my ED I was very active. I had my last period at 5 pounds below my current weight, and it has not returned. I'm confused because I am definitely eating enough for my activity because I am still gaining weight. I went to my doctor and they gave me 10 days of birth control but it still didn't come back. Does anyone have any advice?
Hi guys,I'm interested in learning more about the fundamental differences between AN and BDD. I know in a lot of cases there are some really identifiable differences, but there are some instances where it might be more tricky. Does anyone know of any information/studies that highlight the key similarities and/or differences?Thanks!
My girlfriend of two months has been suffering from Anorexia Nervosa for the past year and a half. At one point she was forced into therapy but she told me she lied about being better. She says she doesnt want to get better but she's getting worse and im terrified for her. I care for her deeply and i cant watch her waste away. She refuses to seek proffesional help as she says she doesnt want to get better. How can i support her? How can i help her break free?
I just confessed to my husband that I have an eating disorder. I've never told anyone in my life. Today, he asked if pizza was okay for dinner for the kids, knowing full well that that is definitely a trigger for binging. I've tried to explain to him that I need help and do not have self control. I was barely starting to recover and relapsed last week and ate an entire pizza. I don't know what to do. When I told him that he didn't understand how hard it is, he just took it personal like I was blaming him. I need his support, how do I help him understand?
It's been a dangerously long time, over a month, since I've eaten normally, I'm desperate to start again and recover and be normal but I'm so, so scared of the eating making me sick, just having a small amount of food in a stomach that's not used to it. Nobody's told me how I need to do this besides eat little, gentle foods often- but for how long? How do I know what won't make me sick? The doctors just brush me off and I'm so frustrated right now.It came on because of my fear of being sick (really bad emetophobia), gastrointestinal issues and I've recently learnt I have a cyst on my ovary. It's become its own problem - I binge ate pretty badly before, no purging, I was massively obese and couldn't control myself. I've lost a lot of weight, not healthily. I've asked many doctors, my gastro and nobody really tells me what to do. I'm frustrated, tired and I feel like I've seen many doctors. I can't afford private counselling so I'm on the NHS waiting list. Any advice? Even a few coins of bananas were terrifying to get down, I'm still scared they'll come back up.
Has anyone tried hypnotherapy for treating their eating disorder? How was the experience? Do you feel like it helped you?
I have been dealing with Binge Eating Disorder for many years, and had some good recovery work after spending 3 months in a rehab facility. I am starting to break down a lot more lately and going back to old habits. My therapist is so swamped with clients that I don't get to see her as often as I need.I wrote sticky notes all over my house telling me to spend at least half an hour a night working on recovery (Journaling, reading, reviewing work from Rehab, etc.). However I am a king of distraction and never end up doing any of it. My therapist thinks its my brain fighting back not wanting to change out of fear or something.Do anyone else have these issues and have any suggestions? Its very frustrating as due to myself being military if I don't get this under control I will loose my job and with the debt racked up from spending $400-$600 a month extra on binges I will loose everything if I loose my job. I tried to use that alone as motivation but it causes more stress and anxiety I binge more...
I have struggled with restricting, over-exercising, bingeing, and purging for the past 10-15 years. My weight has fluctuated between being severely underweight to being at the high end of “normal” during this time. Most of my family is supportive, but my mother sometimes just does not have a filter. I love her to death, but she will often just say whatever comes to mind—even if it is overly critical or downright rude. This wasn't a big problem for me until the last year or so when we started to live in the same city. Now that we see each other fairly often, her comments are really starting to get at me. I have confronted her about it on numerous occasions, but she still doesn't get how much it bothers me.Right now I am picking myself up from my latest relapse into anorexia and she constantly makes crude comments critcizing on my low weight and appearance.My concern is that these comments will impede my progress as I start to gain much-needed weight over the next couple of months, especially because last time I gained weight, my mom was (for lack of a better term) a complete asshole about it, making similar comments except about how I was fat.Have any suggestions on how to talk about this with her so she actually gets how hurtful her comments are? Or should I just accept that this is how she is, deal with it, and try to move on?
Hi all -- the title gives the background more or less. I've been struggling with BN, and there are particular foods (nutella is the devil) that for the time being are rather dangerous for me. I am in the process of seeking professional help (which is proving to be quite a pain, hence "process"), and when I mention to my mother that it would be helpful if certain things were either not in house, or at least somewhere hidden from me, it would be easier to control binge-purge cycles, she grumbles that I am trying to "control her life", more or less hijacking her autonomy to have what foods in the cupboard and wants, and that I should just talk to a shrink. Working on that one, thank you. Nothing I try to do on my own is acknowledged as even partial progress (which I understand is no substitute for professional help, but I realize I'll have plenty of 'homework' to do in any treatment plan I pursue either way).I feel horribly guilty and selfish for asking her to revolve things around me, and I wish from the core of my being I could just ignore those "trigger foods" if I can't enjoy them in moderation, and most of the time I'll just push them to the back of the pantry and avert my eyes, but in times of weakness... shit. Just this nasty cycle of "well, I'll just have one, maybe one more..." followed by god knows how many one-mores, followed by self loathing and subsequent frantic exercise.How do I convince her that I have no manipulative ulterior motives, I just want to get my damn bulimia under control?
A little bit of background (trying to make this as non-ranty as possible): I've been at a 'healthy' weight for a little under two years now, and part of my process was to not weigh myself. I let it get too far though, and when I realized I was getting too big, I found out that I'm now at the higher 'healthy' end of my BMI.There's nothing wrong with being at the high end of my healthy BMI. It's just that I seriously have a lot of fat in places I don't like to see it (limbs, stomach, and the worst - my face). It's been wearing me down, more than I'd like to accept, but I figured I could tackle this the healthy way with diet and exercise, and I trusted myself to not get carried away. However, I've been doing this for over a month now and have hardly lost any weight and I'm getting really discouraged.Please note I'm just trying to get to a healthier weight, I will not go below a healthy BMI, but this situation is making it really hard to not go about this in an unhealthy way which is why I'm asking for help...I had to take a passport photo for my new work ID today, and I almost cried right on the spot wen I saw it. I have a double chin, clear as day - it's not in my head. When I came home I bawled my eyes out, and I still am honestly... all I can think about now is reverting back to my old ways... I'm trying to remember the hell that I went through, but all of that feels like nothing compared to when I look at this picture and I see the double chin. It's making me sick to my stomach.I don't usually see the double chin in the mirror, but only if everything is perfect (my posture/the way I hold my head, the lighting, etc.) and besides, this photo is important as it's something I'm going to have to look at nearly every single day, and so will random customers. I'm so ashamed and embarrassed. I just want to be at a healthy weight where I actually look healthy and in shape, but it's always been either too much or too little.I want to stick to my diet and exercise, but it's really hard to stop myself from saying, 'just skip eating altogether, you know this will work and you can be happy with how you look again'. I don't want to fall back into that, it's just really hard to find the right perspective here... any ideas?
My girlfriend has struggled for 6 years with BN, and used to receive help from a therapist. Then it stopped when her therapist moved to a different state, and she was devastated when she could no longer contact or have therapy sessions with them. They were the only person she could fully open up with. So after they left the state, she relapsed and just continued purging and not eating. She's expressed so much to me about how much she hates herself, and how little her self worth is, and I do my best to listen to her, and tell her how much I appreciate her company. I somewhat understand this, as I had just recently recovered from severe major depressive disorder. After I had been encouraging her and being positive, she was starting to eat more regularly, and purge less, to the point where she hasn't purged (all but one time that I'm aware of) since our relationship started. Recently, she discovered my most recent ex (who suffered from extreme AN) had started modeling and saw how skinny she was. So now my gf see's this as a competition, and has made a goal to get skinnier than her. It's gotten so downhill since she discovered my ex. It's wearing me down, and I know that it shouldn't, and that I need to take care of myself before I can take care of her. All I want is to encourage and support her, but she either doesn't think she needs help, or that she's incurable. I used to refer to support guides on Reddit and other sites for what I could be doing more or better, but now I'm starting to feel like none of it is working and I feel stuck. I don't know what to do, but I want to support my gf so bad. What can I do?
A little background: I've been in recovery for almost 6 years now, have gone through various programs and therapists, and am also diagnosed with depression and anxiety. At the beginning of recovery, I did the Maudsley family therapy while I was still in high school, which helped a lot. I had a lot of issues though with lying, throwing food away secretly, etc at school while my parents and family therapist had no idea. I fessed up to them at some point, and a few times my therapist described me as in recovery but "keeping one toe in the eating disorder", and I feel like that accurately describes my entire recovery so far. Since I'm above 18 now, we can't do family anymore and I feel like my parents are sick of having to watch me all the time (and I hated it and it caused so much friction between us), I'm a healthy weight (as far as I know), but I know I never quite reached my goal weight and I'm still restricting compared to the meal plan I had when I was seeing therapists and nutritionists. I feel like I'm constantly in a limbo between wanting to recover and then using ED to deal with my anxiety, etc. How do you guys commit completely to recovery? How do you stop lying to yourself and your family? How do you make yourself stick to your meal plan even though everything is "fine" physically and you're eating "regularly", but the thoughts and urges are just as bad as ever? I'm okay at, say, passive activities like not buying too many shoes for example, but since eating is such an active thing that we (esp us with ED) really have to force ourselves to do, how do you guys get yourselves to do it? I hate that the rest of my life is going to have to be like this, and I know it would be easier if I could just commit entirely to recovery, but for some reason I just can't. It's so hard ):
I struggle with an EDNOS that I developed as a side effect of an anxiety disorder in high school. I have the disorder under control now, but I still suffer from the horrible eating patterns. I find it very difficult to eat full meals on my own because I do not know what to make (often I will end up making a ton of food and waste half of it), and I find it difficult to eat foods that have a lot of flavour/require a lot of chewing. I really want to put the weight that I lost back on but I don't know how to do so on this kind of diet because it lacks protein.I was wondering if anyone knows of an app or service that could produce a meal plan for me? (I live alone so I do not have a roommate that I could ask to prepare food for me.) As well any tips on how to ease my body into eating normal meals again? My biggest aversion to eating is that while I am hungry, my body feels like it is full even after ingesting very little food and it feels uncomfortable if I try to make myself eat anymore. It can take me hours to eat a whole meal because of this.Thanks in advance.
Hi, r/eatingdisorders. I'm a 20 year old female college student in her last semester of undergrad. I recently had to move back in with my mom for this last semester for financial reasons, and the ED I've been struggling with for maybe about a year or so has gone from an unhealthy quirk with potential to go wrong if left unchecked, to something much more all-consuming (pun-intended?). Bulimia is probably the best descriptor. Normally, throughout the school/work week, I tend to be rather restrictive -- not excessively so, but probably enough to raise a doctor's eyebrows. I have an insane schedule -- 17 credit hours and two small part-time jobs. From Monday through Thursday I leave the house at around 7-8am and don't walk back in the door until around 9 or 10pm. Friday is more 9-5ish, and I tend to spend weekends 10a-2p on schoolwork as well.Basically, I have no life. But the problem is, whenever I have ANY freetime (spring break, weekends I don't have much schoolwork, if I'm sick, etc.) I have these horrible binge-purge cycles, and my binges are almost always on sweets. I'll try to vomit up what I can, but then I'll run over to the gym (even in my insane schedule I'm still in the gym about an hour everyday, sometimes more) and work out for hours, sometimes trying to overcompensate so I there's hope for a caloric deficit. Of course, this gets time consuming and I'll get behind on my work -- and with this time, if I were to spend it "non-productively" I could have maybe done something enjoyable, maybe breaking this isolation which I'm sure plays a role perpetuating this nasty cycle. Despite how exhausting my normal schedule is, being on the go constantly means that I can't binge, and I tend to do whatever I can to avoid being idle -- which is effective (I use that term loosely) most of the time.There's also lots of family problems going on -- as always, really -- that I don't want to spend too much time going into. My mom's a guilt-tripper, my dad and I are estranged -- and as much as I wish I could have a relationship with him, it's probably for the best. My sister is mentally handicapped, and we've never really been close. I try to bond with her, but she's a brick wall. I have a boyfriend whom I see about twice a week and is really my only salient social interaction and support at the moment, and he urges me to get help. I agree with him. I have a therapist which I've been seeing for a while and have built a good rapport with, but because of my schedule, I can't get an appointment in. I tried to go into the school psych services hoping I'd be able to pop in during the occasional spare hours I have between classes, but there's a massive waiting list and the intake lady told me, quite bluntly, that they won't be able to see me before I graduate in April, handed me a card with a 24-hour hotline, and told me to take care.I feel lost, isolated, strained, and horribly, horribly trapped. I hate living back with my mom again; I feel like I've reverted to my childhood, and the memories are painful. She wants me out because my bulimia is too emotionally burdensome for her, but I don't know where I'd go. Maybe my boyfriend? I'm wondering if I could ask my boss if I could cut back my hours to see a shrink, but I tend to work evenings after typical "business hours" anyway. Further still, I have so little money as it stands. If I had any chance in moving out, cutting my work hours would crush it. I don't think my mom will actually kick me out, she tends to be "all talk," but I need to get my ED under control regardless. I can't keep deluding myself that I can kick it on my own without professional helpCan anyone offer advice?
I am almost thirty and I am in (almost) full relapse from my ED. I have the full spectrum of ED since age twelve, but at age twenty-seven I started getting into restriction, compulsive exercise, orthorexia, so on. In March 2014, I entered treatment here in Buffalo. As soon as I got out, things were shaky. I tried my best to fight through, but from January 2015 to now, I can say that I am really not doing well. I know that I am medically a healthy weight, but I still haven't had a period since June 2014, I struggle with eating and resting from exercise. I decided that maybe I need help that my counselor can't give me. In December, I looked into Sol Stone in Elmira, NY. While doing a screening with one of the counselors at Sol Stone, she assessed that because the treatment center that I went to was a weight restorative model that may have heightened my anxieties about food and weight as well as all the numbers that go with it. However, I wasn't able to go to Sol Stone due to financial reasons. My older brother with whom I am close recently moved to Philly. I am supposed to go check out Renfrew on April 4th. Has anyone else been to any of the Renfrew locations? I need some honest feedback. I need to know that I making the right decision. 
I was in hospital earlier today for dental surgery, and I wanted to be knocked out for it, so of course they needed to know my weight for that so I wasn't given too much of the sleeping stuff. I mentioned to the nurses as I was admitted that I can't/don't want to know my weight as I'm in recovery from AN, and if I know my weight my recovery is going to go down the drain. They were very kind and accommodating for such an odd request and I'm incredibly grateful to them.Then the anesthetist comes along. I mention to him that the weight I put on my form was an estimate as I cannot know my weight, and the nurses had an accurate reading so he should refer to that. He then proceeds to throw all that out the window, not listen and tell me my weight anyway, right after I said I can't know it. Great.I'm home now, and my mouth is hella numb so I can't feel any of that, but I'm feeling like crap because I know my weight now, and I feel like a disgusting piece of lard. I'm nearly in tears and I don't know what to do because I can't stop focusing on anything but that number. I've tried so hard for the past three years since I got out of hospital for AN to recover, f*** I was even getting to a point where I could look at myself in the mirror and not see a disgraceful sack of s**t staring back at me, and now it feels like it was all for nothing. I don't know what to do.How do I deal with this?
I eat a very small amount of food almost everyday. Sometimes I push myself not to eat because I'm not hungry enough or I'll go to sleep hungry to save for more calories the next day. I'm always dizzy, I get up from lying down and I have to hold onto something to balance me for a few seconds. I constantly think about calories burning and weight loss. My hands or whole body feels shaky. Every once in a while I'll get a weird twitching vibration feeling in my stomach. It'll go off and on all day. I don't know if I'm hungry or not anymore. My stomach doesn't feel hungry until I start eating. My family thinks I'm doing it on purpose and a part of me is but I don't know how to stop. I know this isn't good, but is it an eating disorder?
I left my previous job to attend residential treatment last summer and started a new position in November. Since then, I've relapsed to the point that I've had to call in sick or leave work early, in addition to seeking urgent medical treatment. Today, I went in for evaluation at a PHP center and was told that I have to go back to residential before they'll accept me due to my current severity. Because FMLA laws require a year of employment, my current position is not protected. I'm running out of money and time.I don't want to uproot my whole life again, but it seems inevitable. Can anyone offer advice?
Hello, I am close friends with a girl I believe has issues with eating. Her sister was like that too, and she looks very thin for her weight. Could you please provide me with some resources to encourage her to be more healthy? Thank you.
Could really use help here. I was in a long term, very serious, 4 year relationship that was heading towards marriage (we were both post grad). We were always in varying degrees long distance and there were questions about whether she could get a job were I was after grad school (I had an inflexible job situation), and some other issues causing some conflict, but overall smooth sailing. But really the last two years she changed, in a real way, from the person I fell in love with that really checked all the boxes, to a very high strung, high maintenance, stressed generally unhappy person. It was like varying degrees of close to insanity, like a constant morning routine of what she ate and did, if it got screwed up the day was screwed up, just the list went on and on. I tried to talk to her about it because I had no idea what was going on, and on a certain level I thought well maybe this is who she really is and that is something you eventually find out about people when you've known them long enough. And with the distance, the job issue, and then who she "turned into," I couldn't do it anymore. So, we fought, broke up, it was nasty, said a bunch of things that can't be unsaid to each other, etc. etc., we still loved each other but realize it stopped working etc. etc.. This approach was "working" for me and I was moving forward somewhat, but she finally came out and told me recently that she was struggling with a full blown eating disorder of the restriction kind for really the last two years of our relationship. She said everything I had said to her in the post-break up nasty discussions about how I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her and how I thought her many quirks were bordering on insanity suddenly made sense to her because a relative she had went through the same disorder and she felt the same way around that person. She basically said the breakup was rock bottom for her, she's getting help through therapy, and honestly she seems like a changed or at least changing person now that we've resumed contact somewhat.So in nutshell, I thought I had wildly misjudged her for my first two years with her and got roped into dating the most high maintenance, inflexible person, and I broke up with her largely over that. Instead, I find out how she was behaving (according to her) was for a completely different reason, let alone a mental illness. A real lightbulb moment that could have solved a ton of our problems, if I had found out about it, say, any time over the last two years of us dating. I knew something was up, but didn't know it was that bad. So on one hand I'm really pissed she never told me about this, but also really angry at myself for not figuring out she was going through this essentially alone and I couldn't find a way to help her. Like what if I had forced the discussion on the personality part, and maybe the real "cause" would have finally come out by coincidence? I kick myself over it. But at least she's in therapy now, and I genuinely hope she gets better for her own sake.The question is (finally), we've started to toy around with the idea of trying to figure this out. The distance/jobs is something that's solvable. But how do you know someone has really changed mentally? The last thing I want is to get back into this, find out she is still like how she was, and break up again like a walking stereotype of a couple that got back together with an ex. Mainly I have a hard time trusting that everything I was struggling with about her was fully due to the eating disorder. I kind of remember how she was when we first started dating and that's the person I fell in love with, but the overwhelming memories are of how she became for the second half of it/why we broke up. And on her front, well I broke her heart, she really regrets not telling me about all this but also she lost her trust in me now because I drove this wedge in between us with the breakup, and I fully understand her being skittish now. .....it's a mess. Advice?
For background information, I have been struggling with my eating disorder for roughly five years now rather cyclically. I am 19/F. Around January of 2015 I began relapsing into old habits, and in June of 2015 stopped menstruating. This was very scary for me, as the last time I stopped menstruating I later came very close to dying and it was traumatic and awful. I reached out for help from my family doctor in October of 2015. Now, I had been going through a very stressful period from late august to when I met with my doctor. She had me fill out a questionnaire sheet about how I was feeling (like have you had suicidal thoughts? how sad are you? type thing) and diagnosed me with depression. In 20/20 hindsight, I have always been a little introspective and shy, and keep in mind that at this time I was incredibly stressed out, upset, and emotional. She diagnosed me within minutes and prescribed 20mg daily of Peroxetine HCL (paxil) and told me that it would help me feel better and improve my concentration. She told me NONE of the possible long term negative side effects of the drug. She told me that I would feel a little worse and experience negative side effects for a week (such as depression, not being able to sleep, etc) before I started to feel better. I trusted this doctor, and didn't know much about the drug, and consulted with my mom who told me she had taken SSRI's before in the past and they worked for her. I trusted this doctor because I had taken a joint counselling session with her and a psychologist to talk about my eating issues before this diagnosis because I was reaching out for help and recovery, which is important because she understood and had full knowledge of the extent of my issues surrounding food, weight gain, and control. I took the medication from October 2015 to March 10th 2016. On this medication I have felt lethargic, sad and/or emotionless, and my concentration has been worse but I trusted my doctor and my mom who both told me it would make me feel better and to stay on it, and tried to get me to up the dose. I have also been steadily gaining weight during this same period of time. A LARGE amount of weight over which I have had no control. I have not changed my eating or exercise habits only to make them MORE restrictive to counteract this bizarre weight gain. I have been exercising every day and making my body sore and tired, and decreasing my calorie intake. But also I've begun using behaviors again (chewing and spitting), which was an embarrassing habit I had managed to quit for over a year before I started taking Paxil. My appetite increased but this did not lead to me consuming more food, because of my use of behaviors. This was very awful and time consuming and shattered my confidence and self esteem). Still however, on March 7th I had my first appointment at the doctor to discuss recovery (I had put it off for a long time - I don't know if anyone else has had this but it was just to be weighed, have blood work done, and discuss putting together a support team). At this point in time I was distraught and had NO desire to go through recovery or follow through, but I had made myself accountable to my mom. I was weighed at the appointment and the doctor told me my weight (I'm not sure if she should have done this or not?) and I was on the low-ish end of the healthy BMI range for me and my doctor was ecstatic but I didn't know how to take this because of the weight I gained  since I first came in to see her. It is good to be at a healthy weight but I did NOT get here on my own terms, I had NO control over it, and it has DESTROYED my desire to recover. All I can think about is losing the weight. I quit my medication because I read that Paxil can make you gain weight. I quit cold turkey (weaned for like 2 days) and am on day 5 of withdrawals. They feel awful but I was just so panicked to get it out of my system. I've been living in my own personal hell for all this time of losing absolute control of my body and just steadily gaining weight, which is unhealthy but my ONLY coping mechanism and something that is VERY hard for me to relinquish and what I was seeking help for. I spent Christmas starving myself because I was so afraid of weight gain, I didn't get to enjoy any of the foods I love and I hurt my Grandmother's feelings because I was so afraid. I know it's good to be healthy, but this is NOT how I wanted to get here and it has been a major setback. I know that once I get this drug out of my system I'm going to resort back to my old ways and suffer a major relapse to lose this weight and I'm terrified. I'm mad at my doctor for putting me on this specific drug because it seems to be the worst for weight gain after I trusted her and I feel betrayed, and I'm mad at my mom for breaking my trust and telling me that SSRI's worked for her when she told me today that she NEVER EVEN FOLLOWED THROUGH ON TAKING THEM because she was afraid of the bad side effects. I feel hurt and insecure and my suicidal ideation peaked before I went off the drug. I have never felt worse than this in my entire life. I went to the doctor trying to recover once and for all and now all that strength and courage is completely gone and I'm scared that I won't get to that point ever again. Does anyone have any advice for trying to fight this off? Has anyone tried Paxil and maybe I'm just crazy? I don't know what to do right now, and feel completely hopeless. I don't think I will be going back on any medication. 
My therapist and I recently discussed Binge Eating Disorder after she noticed I put on a lot of weight. I recently got a full time desk job, so I have no time to exercise and I'm not getting exercise at work. I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, and we on medication for a period of time a year ago. It worked well, and helped a lot. I was able to enact a strict regimen of calorie counting and exercising to lose weight. Once off my medication, I began binge eating again.Some history would be my family gets angry if you leave food on the plate. My mom will serve me, harass me if I don't finish it, then constantly verbally abuse me about being fat. She will not allow you to serve yourself. My dad doesn't do anything to help. All of my grandparents have diabetes, so I'm not trying to lose weight to look good. Really, I have a lot of risk factors that I need to avoid now. Other than diabetes, heart problems and issues with circulation are in my family. Because of this and how judgmental my mom is, I binge. I binge at odd hours, usually. I have literally set my alarm to 2am so I can wake up and binge. And then after I sit in my bed and cry. I really hate myself. When I spoke to my therapist she said to look at Binge Eating Disorder. My mother won't help me, I don't know what to do, but I know this isn't healthy. It's not even about my figure, anymore. It's about the fear of early diabetes. I need resources, help. Please, I'm really lost and I have no one to turn to.
I have a friend of a friend (acquaintance, really) who I don't know very well but I'm concerned that she may have an ED. She appears to have lost an unhealthy amount of weight but my only context for this is Facebook posts. I wanted to see if it was possible to post a copy of what I would like to send to her, as a message that I am concerned and support her. This is touchy because I don't know her well but I am very concerned for her health. I want to make sure my message doesn't come off wrong. I thought posting it here to see what others thought would be a good avenue to make sure I don't upset her further or offend her.
I'm not really sure how to start this one off so I'll get right to the important part. I saw a mention of a 'pro' eating disorder subreddit elsewhere, and I went out of sheer morbid curiosity. Some things started clicking in my head that are really bothering me. I've always struggled with body image, and at one point I looked like some of those horrific "inspiration" photos they pass around. I saw a lot of myself in that subreddit and I don't really like it. I just moved and I won't have insurance for a while, so if there's anything you can recommend to me while I iron that out please let me know.
Hello, here's the post we're looking for advice on:TL;DR roommate is stealing food, hardly ever eats around us, supposedly has intense allergies but would have reacted to the ingredients in the food she's stolen. I'm currently living in a house with 4 other girls, and food has been going missing since January. It's always things that are high in fat or calories, like chocolate, pitas, cereal, and birthday cake. We always write our names on our things so everyone knows who it belongs to. We've always pointed out when things go missing, so everyone else in the house knows that we're noticing.Recently, one of my roommates (we'll call her Allison) who lived with "Stephanie" last year told me that this happened then, too. Allison and the third roommate had worked out that it was probably Stephanie who was stealing the food last year, but they didn't have any proof. They had spoken to Stephanie about it, and mentioned that all signs pointed to her, but she denied it even though she couldn't provide another explanation. Everything was fine this year until we signed the lease for next year, and then things started going missing again. The missing birthday cake was the last straw, so Allison went into Stephanie's room while Stephanie was out, and found several wrappers in her garbage can. They all had writing on them, clearly indicating that they were Allison's and not to take them. Stephanie hasn't come home yet, so we're trying to figure out what to do. The thing is though, Stephanie had been updating us on her health throughout the year, and she told us that she's allergic to a number of things and absolutely can't eat them without experiencing pain. All of the things found in her garbage can contain those ingredients she's "allergic" to. During the day, she eats very little, and almost never when anyone else is around to witness. What we do see her eat fits with the allergies she told us she has, but the amount we see her eat is so low it's obviously not healthy/doesn't sound possible. It seems like Stephanie might be binging or sleep eating or something. It seems more conscious though, because she always covers her tracks. We love living with her, and she doesn't seem like the type to purposely steal food and then easily lie to us about it. It seems more like she's unable to help herself from taking things. Obviously, we're upset about the missing food, but mostly we just want to help her if we can. So far, Allison has kept the wrappers she found in Stephanie's garbage can as proof, but we don't really know what else to do from here. It doesn't seem feasible to get Stephanie's family involved. Can anyone offer suggestions on how to handle this?
After a breakup in November, I had started restricting because I just had no appetite and became underweight. I was sexually assaulted in December and relapsed pretty heavily the end of that month into bulimia because we had a bad storm and for a few days I couldn't run and started having panic attacks at work and it was the only thing that helped settle the anxiety. I've since then become quite underweight but able to maintain my weight within a few lbs of this the last month. I've been seeing my doctor throughout and also started therapy. Primarily my relapse has been anxiety/trauma induced not body image. I know I look and am very sick but I can't seem to control the anxiety and panic attacks any other way. Medications only work for the anxiety by putting me to sleep essentially. We've considered antidepressants but in the past they have made me suicidal while on them and it's a risk I'm not willing I take right now. Inpatient has been offered several times and while I am willing to work outpatient I will not do inpatient. I myself am a nurse, disagree with the models typically used and available at facilities near me, and do not think the environment would help me for several reasons.I am so tired of waking up everyday, throwing up, repeating because I feel so physically weak from throwing up that I can't not eat again, which continues until I take medication to make me fall asleep. When I asleep I either have nightmares about what happened and even sometimes more cruelly very good dreams where I am back with my ex and things are normal again. I wake up hopeless and anxious. Sometimes the only thing I look forward to is knowing I can get rid of the feelings by just simply binging and purging but I feel so tired and worn out these days. I had a previous trip planned to Europe which I was hoping would cheer me up and maybe break the habit but things have just as bad here. I know why I feel like how I do but the things causing me stress I have no control over- I can't make the police work faster, I can't make the DA want to prosecute my case, and the idea that nothing will happen to them while I'm a mess of a person slowly killing myself trying to feel some relief makes me unable to function I'm so anxious. I can't keep doing this. I'm trying my best in therapy but I'm so mentally uncomfortable I can't help myself. I love my family and I know they're worried and I want to get better but I'm at capacity. I can't fix this one, I feel like what I need is closure on my case and it's the one thing no one can give me. Has anyone been able to bounce back from similar? Can anyone offer advice?
I feel silly asking this as I don't want to undermine issues others may have which is why I shy away from seeking answers.All my life, I have been OBSESSED with my figure. I literally live off of the phrase "oh my god! you're a stick!". I don't purge after meals, I don't refuse to eat meals, but I grow anxious after eating meals and find myself only eating a little at a time. I rarely finish meals. I recently started gagging toward the end of eating meals  because the thought of food is sometimes so sickening. I'm a little concerned with where my mind has been subconsciously going recently. Is this of concern? What should I do?
Hello! A close friend of mine who's really dear to me seems to have an eating disorder. She has every common behavioral symptom. She restricts, she obsessively exercises, she'll throw up on purpose, she feels disgusted with herself after eating, she bases her entire worth on her weight loss, she will occasionally binge eat because she can't handle the constant hunger etc. Despite all this, she is at a completely normal weight, and therefore uses that to say she doesn't have an eating disorder. This has been going on for 3 years, and she tells everyone it's a diet, and she can get away with it because of her normal weight, and the fact she used to be just barely overweight. I have tried to talk to her about this many times, and she'll either deny there's a problem, she'll dismiss it due to her normal weight, or she'll flat out tell me she doesn't care to change things. She refuses to see a professional. I don't know how to support her at all, I've struggled with other mental illnesses but never an eating disorder. As far as I know, no one else in her life talks to her about her eating habits. I would really appreciate some advice on what to do to help her, especially on bad days. Sorry if this is too long.
Hey there, My name is Parker and i am currently putting together a website with the intention of creating a hub for resources and information for treating and conquering depression and other mental illnesses. I myself have been suffering from depression for about 4 years now, and the content on the website will be largely focused on depression.As a moderator of a mental health website, I have some questions for you:1.What would you like to see in a mental health website?2.Would you like to provide links and traffic for each other? (my website <---> your subreddit)3.What are some similar resources you are familiar with (other than subreddits) that would benefit reaching out to?Thanks for your time, I look forward to hearing back! -Parker
Hi Lads,I am suffering from NES for a very long time (years already), but I didnt took it serious until i started gaining some fat cause I am getting in my very late 20nies and my metabolism is I guess getting slower and slower.I wake up 5-6 times a week (almost every day) around 4am and I go straight to eat something. I do not feel hunger but I have to eat something and most of the time sweets. Its not a huge amount. I think its related to my mouth being dry or something so lately i go to bed with a glass of water near me. But I still do it, like I can drink the glass and then after 1-2 hours I wake up again to get something to eat. Some other things to note are:Cause I am aware of my sweet intake @ night, and I know its gonna happen, i try to minimize the sweet intake during the day like almost to 0. BMI charts put me slightly above the normal range, and I feel out of shape.Can anyone offer any suggestions to overcome the NES?

I've recently started taking medications that drastically effect my appetite to where I wait till late in the day to eat, and even if I feel hungry I resist eating, as I have difficulty motivating myself to eat. As a result, I have been eating very little. I have had a problem overeating and binge eating my whole life. How do you become inspired by food again? I love cooking but I just don't have that spark with these meds. (I cannot stop taking the meds because it has improved my life so much)
I've been trying to stop binging for over a year and realized that my restrictive medical diet makes me binge even more because I have to avoid some foods.  The foods and ingredients I have to avoid are very common. Just the fact that I can't have these things makes the urges build and build until I find myself stuck in a binging frenzy until I get physically sick from them. I realize that being able to eat anything in moderation would probably help and would help me change my perspective on "good" and "bad" foods but that doesn't seem doable. I have found substitutes for very few things which makes it even more difficult. It puts me in a very "black and white" position. Is there anything I can do to help my situation? 
My wife in anorexic. She admits as much to me in moments of candor. She doesn't want to get help. She continues to tell me she wants to lose weight, even as I tell her that her cheeks look hollow. She is significantly underweight, She gets mad at me for trying to bring her food. She runs 2 to 3 times a day. When we go out to dinner she immediately takes laxatives when we get home. I know she loves cheese so I keep it around the house, last night she threw all the cheese I had bought in the trash in front of me while yelling at me, accusing me of trying to make her fat. Then later in the night I noticed she wasn't in bed so I went to the kitchen. She was bent over the counter, a box of crackers torn open in front of her, her head in her hands crying. She turned to look at me and with tears coming down her face said "I'm so hungry." I took out some salami and bread and had her eat a few pieces then carried her back to bed. It broke my heart. I don't know what to do. I thought I could post in your thread to learn about what she is going through and how best to help her. I love her more than anything. I can't risk pushing her away, but I can't stand by and watch her destroy her health. I'm mostly a lurker on reddit. Occasionally I chime in with a sarcastic comment. This is the first time I actually need help. I need to learn about what I can do and what she is going through. Please tell me I am in the right place.
I haven't been obsessive about an eating disorder for three years, started for the first time ten years ago. It comes up every now and then I suppose but I just constantly work on it, and having a positive body image and focusing on strength.. but for some reason when my boyfriend can skip meals. It makes me jealous. I over reacted today when I asked him if he ate anything while I was gone (I had breakfast with him) And he didn't eat. We ate at 9:30 in the morning, and he hadn't eaten again until I made him pizza at 9PM. I always ask him to eat. I especially don't like eating when he doesn't eat. I feel disgusting (to the point where I get ridiculously upset at myself for even feeling gross about such a thing) when I eat more than him in a day. It is completely unfair to him as well. I told him I feel this way but I guess I'm just looking to converse with someone who has the same kinda thinking as I do, someone who's gone thru an ED or obsessive eating or something.. I ate breakfast and lunch and a snack and then pizza with him then got mad at myself and purged for the first time in six months. I don't know how to make it better. I know how to help myself, but I don't know what to do now. This is the first time I've really acknowledged it. I don't know if it's a trigger or what. I told him I feel jealous of him. I think about eating a lot (should I eat, what I'm eating, when I should eat it, how specific foods affect me :( I don't know what is with me. I used to know it was half anorexia, half binge and purge. Now I have no clue. Can anyone offer advice?
Hi, I'm new here so I apologize if this has been asked before and I just didn't see it.I am, unfortunately, relapsing with an ED after about 6-7 years of being okay and a maintaining a normal weight. I used to be really underweight, then I bounced between normal and high-ish weights, and now I find myself quickly dropping the pounds due to old behaviors such as restricting, overexercising, etc.I did not receive professional help the first time around. This time, however, is a lot different. I am older, I'm tired of ED consuming my entire life, and I have a wonderful partner who is totally supportive and is encouraging me to get help. I feel just terrible that he has to put up with my issues and I know deep down it worries him. I also know that he doesn't completely understand my eating disorder and he said he wants to learn more about it. Can anyone recommend a good book or other resources that are geared towards people who are living with someone with an ED? Thank you :)
Hi, it has in the past week occurred to me that I may have some form of an ED. I suddenly realized I have had a pattern through my life of gaining lots of weight, followed by intensively working it off again. Whenever I stop exercising, it's always on the assumption I'll start again when I start feeling fat again.At my worst point a couple of years ago I became super obsessed with losing all my body fat and would do 4-5 10km runs a week plus cycling, weights, walking etc. By the end I was down to like a really low body fat and starting to like my body a bit but hated my face, bc it was so thin and bony. So I stopped all exercise and began gaining weight again. As I did so, I started liking my face more but hating my body! Now a year and a half later I feel fat again and have been binging as a way to force myself to start another exercise phase.Pls tell me I'm not imagining this or overreacting. I'm just surprised I never noticed this as a problem before. Is this an eating disorder? Can anyone offer advice on what I can do?I'm 32yo trans female and more self esteem issues than you can poke a stick at.
I have been bulimic/anorexic for 12 years, and the past 24 hours have been the most "purge and restrict free" day I have experienced since I was 14. A personal victory for me but I wanted to thank you guys. A user encouraged that I start attending ED Anonymous meetings and they have really helped pave the way for my recovery. It never too late to ask for help. 
I feel like a failure when I eat. Food makes me feel disgusting. I feel powerful and good about myself when I don't eat. I just feel this need to hurt and punish myself. I don't care about about being "pretty", I just want to be as small as possible. I feel like it's not enough, I want to just disappear. For the past six weeks, Ive been restricting my calories significantly below what someone my weight/height should be consuming, but I haven't been fasting. It wasn't intentional at first, the first week or so, I was just too busy to eat and I felt like I was riding high on an incredible wave and it all came crashing down when I did eat. I have a lot of anxiety about weight and I am terrified of becoming fat or gaining weight of any kind. I started purging recently, I've purged daily for the past three days. In the beginning of high school, as a cross country runner, I did struggle with disordered eating and was obsessed with food and exercise. I've always hated my body and have never felt thin enough. It's not even that I want to be pretty, I just want to be small. I just want to hurt myself. I hate my body so bad, I want out of it. I don't know if this is truly an eating disorder or if it's just....I don't know. Ive also been having constant intrusive memories about childhood sexual abuse that I endured and it makes me feel even more disgusted with myself and makes me want to destroy myself. I feel like a monster.**What can I do to stop hurting myself?****Where can I look for help?**
I used to be very overweight, but at the age of 14-ish I lost much of it through walking a silly amount daily and sadly by starvation. Now I've been slightly underweight (not dangerously though) since then, I'm 18 now. My metabolism is still ruined and I haven't had a normal diet since before I lost weight. I eat about one time a day, max 2, and it's almost never a full meal. I'm clearly starving my body still BUT I'm struggling not to gain on this amount. Since my metabolism and body is so messed up, and has been for such a long period of time, is there any way of getting a good metabolism without gaining all of my fat back?
My name is Cindy Glover. I’m working on a marketing campaign focused on Eating Disorder recovery in conjunction with the national awareness week coming up Feb. 21-27.The project’s theme is “life is better on the other side” and the title is “I am not Ed.” For so many people suffering from an ED, it’s their entire identity. We want to show some of the great things that happen when an eating disorder no longer defines who you are.This project is personal to me because I suffered with bulimia from the age of 15-23 and was hospitalized three times. I'm now a happy, healthy 45-year-old mother of two.We’re hoping to get people to post photos of themselves holding a card that says #IamnotEd, with a caption incorporating the three sentences below.I am not EdI am _________________ (a mother, an athlete, a confident woman, …)When I let go of ________________ (obsessing about weight, bingeing and purging, being ashamed of my body…)I was able to _____________ (go swimming for the first time in years, have a healthy relationship, eat with other people, create two amazing kids,…)The inspiration is a blend of the Humans of New York photo series, and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.To kick it off, we'd like at least 20 photos and captions from people willing to make a statement about how life is better on the “other side” of recovery. With that as a foundation, hopefully it can spread across social media with people all over the country contributing (possibly including celebrities).Do you think any of your members would like to participate? They do not have to give their names.If possible, we'd like them to post on social media and/or email me at cindy@frac.tl. We'll be building an "I Am Not Ed" landing page, and I'll share the link as soon as we have it up and running. Many thanks, --Cindy Glover
Has anyone close to you ever told someone else about your eating disorder without your permission? How do you feel about someone telling someone else about your ED? If it's never happened, how do you think you'd feel?
Hi,I have been unsuccessful treating my BED with therapy, medication, or anything. I've been seeing doctors out the wazoo for years. But, I continue to gain weight, even if I stall for a while. I have begun going to OA, but it also isn't really helping.Does anybody here have experience with inpatient or outpatient rehab centers for EDs? I am to the point where I might die in the next 5 years if I don't completely rework my life from the bottom up. I'm thinking the best place to do that is in rehab, treating it just like life threatening drug addiction. I have been overeating to the point where I have uncontrolled diabetes, high BP, high cholesterol, and more recently bad reflux and swelling of the feet. Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)
For three or four years I have thought of myself as recovered. I've been diagnosed with both anorexia and bulimia at different times, but I've really been alright for years. At a stable low but healthy weight without any intentional restricting or purging.Here's the problem, I'm a performer/athlete. In recent months I have greatly increased my training. I also moved across the country and my lifestyle changed completely (for one thing, I know longer have a boyfriend cooking for me). I know I haven't lost weight, but I'm worried that I'm not eating enough. At the same time I'm terrified of eating more. But I am beginning to feel like I did when I was sick. I'm getting dizzy and my period (which has never been truly regular) might be MIA. I'm definitely not intentionally restricting, I avoid any cardio training because I hate it and know it's not healthy for me. But I'm worried that my reluctance to eat more might be a relapse, and I'm not sure what to do about it. Any thoughts or suggestions? Any tips to avoid relapse?
Between the ages of 11-12 to 16 I had an odd relationship with food. I wouldn't have classified myself as anorexic or bulimic because I didn't check all the symptoms boxes and have never wanted to lose weight. I am naturally very thin and have a small build, I used to eat fairly well as a child but was always quite little. Fast metabolism and genetics I suppose. My obsession at the time was rather to gain weight because I hated the way my body looked (hence why I can't classify myself as anorexic as the thought process is the complete opposite). However I rarely wanted to have people see me eat in school. My mom would pack me lunches and I would either never eat them and hide them or would wait until I got home and either throw them away or consume them while hiding out in my room. I also never ate breakfast at the time. I ate a decent amount of food at dinner or on weekends when my family was there but that was about it. I still have moments where I have an odd relationship with food as I do not eat when something bothers me and can go on for days like this. Is this an eating disorder? Does anyone have any advice for me?Additional information, if it can be of any help: I have had suicidal thoughts since the age of 12 and have been struggling with depression. 
I wrote a bunch more here but it all seemed stupid. I thought I had kicked my ED but in the last 6 months my bulimia has come back in full force. My "binges" aren't severe, but they have been brought on by my desire to lose weight, as since treatment I gained some weight. I can't control my eating, then retroactively assert control through purging. I am scared. I went to a counselor 6 months ago, after my first purge, but haven't been able to bring it up. My ED has been 100% in secret and I'm having trouble coming clean for my own sake. Help me please.What can I do to get help if nobody knows about my ED and I am scared to tell anyone?
I have a long history of dieting/binging, calorie counting, the whole lot. My biggest problem is binge eating (no purging). I consider myself educated on causes of BED, but recovery seems daunting, as if I'll never have a relationship with food that's "normal" like everyone else, even if the binging stops. I understand that BED is often caused by dieting, your animal brain trying to refeed your body, etc. I also have read "Brain Over Binge" and am aware of intuitive eating. I do not binge often anymore; I had my first one in about a year last week (in the past they were 1-4 binges per week), so I decided to go see a therapist to prevent it from escalating further.In the past, I saw one therapist who told me re: BED "it's okay if you binge; just do it on fruits and veggies!" I never went back. Another was always 10 mins late to every appt and fought me saying "You don't need to diet, you look great. I don't get it." These were self-proclaimed ED specialists. Enter now, as I wearily enter a new therapists office who specializes in ED's in hopes of some help. During our appt, she asked me about family history of course. I had a tumultuous childhood (addictive parent suicide attempts, divorce, etc), but I consider myself strong and independent as a result. I've made my peace with my childhood and do the best I can as an adult to make healthy decisions and am successful in most areas of my life. Long story short, this therapist insists that my binging is related to my childhood and my narcissistic mother, and states that once I "fix" those problems in my life that the binging will magically go away. What I feel like she doesn't understand is I have already come to peace with my past, and though I can't "fix" my mom I try to maintain a healthy relationship with her. My problem is my years-long obsession with getting the body I want and have felt like I deserve, and wanting to just accept my body for what it is and see food normally. I guess my question is; should I listen to my therapist? Should I seek out someone new? I guess I'm just tired of people trying to pin all of my problems on my childhood, instead of taking a different perspective. All I want is to be at total peace with my body, to end the diet/binge cycle, and to have a healthy relationship with food.

Hi all, I'm coming here looking for some advice. A very dear friend of mine has been struggling with bulimia / purging for quite some time. Recently, my friend has opened up to me about it, and it's extensiveness and how it's been affecting their life. I've tried to be available for them; being very open to listen and try to suggest potential solutions to the problem, but I'm afraid it doesn't help.I'm not really sure where to go from here. I know a lot of solving the problem is trying to get the person to want to change, or speak to someone. Unfortunately, my friend doesn't want to speak to anyone about this. What can I do? What should I do?
I've always been an impulsive/compulsive overeater (thanks ADHD) and I was pretty average weight until last year when I moved away for university (2014) and I had no one around to keep a sense of structure in my life. This year I've been on track with healthy eating, but I've also come to develop a fear of calories. I check calories on labels every time I eat and I have established fairly low limits of "acceptable size", above which is too much and I likely won't finish it out of guilt/disgust with myself. This behavior, which I've recognized is sort of restricting, alternates with mindless binging. In fact, the restrictive periods come about after binging because I've begun to see it as a way to "make up for it". I only recently read about "non-purging" bulimia and my habits sound scarily similar to it. I think I'm slightly overweight, but I feel like every bit of fat is amplified in my eyes and if I wear clothes that hug my body too tightly I usually feel like I'm bursting at the seams. I am almost certain that I'm not as big as I perceive myself to be. I don't really know what to do because I want to lose weight but in a healthy way, and I don't want my parents to worry about me. Can anyone offer advice?
So my boyfriend thinks I have really cute cheeks, and wants me to pinch them cause yeah he thinks its adorable. He doesnt know it triggers me a lot, and that i used to stand in front of the mirror when i was younger, pinching my cheeks to emphasize how fat i thought i was. How do i tell him without hurting him?
Hi, I'm a young man and I've had some problems with being underweight and gaining weight for the past 2 years or so. I've been noticing some things that make me think I might have some type of ED. I'm sorry if this post is too long or has some mistakes.Several months ago I managed to gain enough weight to get have a healthy BMI rating, but I had some issues about feeling like I gained too much fat and not enough muscle, so I did some dumb stuff and lost too much weight, putting me back into the underweight category. I've been underweight again since around October or September, and telling myself that I'm trying to gain weight despite not eating enough calories. I guess I'm afraid that I'll gain too much fat so I keep my calorie surplus a bit low, and I have a lot of trouble eating enough on non-lifting days so I calorie cycle (eat extra surplus on lifting days and around maintenance on rest) but I'm thinking that it's not enough to help me gain weight since I've stayed about the same weight since October. I'm just so afraid that I'll gain fat even though when I compare pictures of myself at a healthy weight, I had pretty low body fat and more muscle than I have now, so I mostly lost muscle weight.For the past week I've had severe fatigue on my rest days, where I have hardly any energy after going on my daily walks despite still eating meals. I have very low appetite and feel a bit depressed and hollow, not as bad as I have before but I feel like I wouldn't mind just ceasing to exist to stop the stress of dealing with everything. I started to realize that I share a lot of symptoms for anorexia and bulimia listed online, but I don't know if that's just coincidence and I don't want to self-diagnose. Reading those symptoms just makes me feel even worse, like everything I've done to try to get in shape has been a waste and it makes me feel terrible. I really just want to be in healthy shape and be able to function normally, and do athletic things I love to do without so much stress.I just know that something is wrong with me, but I don't know what I can do. I live with my mother and I'm afraid to tell her about all of this, because I don't want to cause more stress and feel like such a failure for being a bad son. I know that I have to tell her how I feel, but really don't know when or how I should. And I don't know if I should be worried about feeling so fatigued and low, or if it's just a coincidence type of thing.I'd like to hear any advice or insight anybody has that might help, thank you for reading and I'm sorry if I took too much of your free time.
Sometimes my boyfriend shows me pictures of hot girls from his insta, its a long story. Anyways, just seeing hot girls trigger me so so much. After he showed me three pictures ive purged twice and i cant get the self hatred and urge to starve myself out of my system. He wont repeat showing me pics like that again though, he connected the dots and being really really hard on himself for it, even though i didnt want him to find out. How can i stop the racing thoughts of comparing myself to everyone, it hurts so so much and its hurting my boyfriend that i'm so fragile
I would really like some insight, if possible. I don't know what's happening with my body and mind at the moment. I used to suffer from Bulimia. I haven't purged in weeks now though, but I still binge. So I decided to tackle that part of the whole issue. I've cut out several foods that I used to binge on and now I have nightmare of losing control, of waking up and having eaten all those foods, of being back to stuffing my face with no control over what or how much I eat. It's terrifying. Every morning I wake up convinced I failed at yet another part of life and I'm back to that out-of-control sad little monster. Also my list of things I'm 'not allowed to eat' because otherwise they would trigger me to binge, is getting longer and longer, I get more and more fearful around food and have panic attacks when I just see something in a store. Or if a friend offers me something... I'm scared that I will forget that I'm not eating these things anymore and then relapse. When I eat I usually eat the same things that don't make me panic, but there are maybe five things on my 'safe' list, which can't be healthy either.Is this a normal part of the whole process of stopping the binging? Or is my eating disorder just changing to something different? Do the nightmares and night sweats ever go away? Is there a way to speed up this part of the recovery? I really can't deal with it and I don't know what to do.
As I've learned more about food addiction and binge eating disorder I feel like it could be an explanation for what I'm going through. Does anyone know of books I can get that explain things well?I see a therapist regularly about other things and I wouldn't be opposed to talking with him about it but I'd like to do some of my own research first
For the majority of my teen years, I have struggled really badly with anorexia. I'm currently 2 years into recovery, and I am at the heaviest I have ever been. I'm the same weight I was when I was 13, (I'm 18 now, and I stopped growing at age 13,) which is about a pound overweight, but those that I confide in swear to me that I am not the same size I was then. I don't understand how that's possible, and I am convinced that everyone is lying to me. I was doing really well with the mental part of recovery, but for the past few weeks, my weight has been the only thing I can think about. This is causing me to have full days where I just completely break down. I cry for hours on end, and I feel so overwhelmed. I feel so sad and angry and out of control. I lash out on my fiance when he tries to help because the only thing that makes sense is that he and everyone else is lying to me, and that just makes me feel even worse.I was hoping that someone might have some advice on coping with this? It's become an almost daily occurrence, and I need to find some way to get this under control.
I've been struggling with an eating disorder for the last little bit and I've been making so much progress. I'm very proud of myself. However, I tend to slide back into my bingeing (and then later as a result, restricting) ways every time social gatherings happen. I feel as if most of our social interactions at least in the society I am from revolve around getting together to eat and drink, especially in university. But I really struggle with eating, especially in social situations. Does anyone have any suggestions for what I could do with friends that isn't about eating, especially for low income university kids in dorm rooms? or any tips on how they've overcome similar situations in their own lives?? Thanks so much!!
I am very health conscious, there are a lot of foods I refuse to eat. I've always considered being healthy to be a good thing. How can a diet like mine be unhealthy? Then recently one of my friends told me she thinks I'm orthorexic, that the fact I wouldn't even eat (for example) one piece of chocolate might be physically healthy but mentally that's not healthy at all. I don't see how a healthy diet can be an eating disorder, like what makes a diet healthy and what makes it orthorexia, where is that line? On top of that, while I am at a healthy weight, I can't deny that I've always been terrified of being overweight and I've always been very upset if I gain any weight, probably to an unhealthy extent. I've always been a lot more comfortable with myself when I'm thinner than average, and I might sometimes skip meals or be a little too preoccupied with what I eat. This has been going on for as long as I can remember, since a long time before I started cutting certain unhealthy foods from my diet. If I do have orthorexia, is that totally separate from my other issues with my weight and body image, or could my possibly unhealthily healthy diet just be a part of a bigger problem? When I started eating more healthily, I genuinely was just trying to be healthier, it wasn't about weight loss, so I'm inclined to think it's not a problem, that my diet right now is fine. I've always managed to maintain a healthy weight, so I've always figured I must be healthy, but my friend bringing up orthorexia has made me think about all of this a little more and I don't know if I should be concerned. 
Is ED intensive outpatient program considered rehab because it is in a treatment center?
Hey all. I've been struggling with something lately, and I was hoping I could get some input from the community. Just as background, I'm recovering from AN. I've been doing really well on the recovery front, my eating has been totally solid and I've been sticking to the plan that my nutritionist cooked up. I'm practically weight restored and I am no longer experiencing the mind-boggling levels of hunger that I once did. However, and this is the problem, I can't convince my parents that I'm full. Whenever I express that I am no longer hungry, even when I eat a completely reasonable and healthy amount, my dad or mom will just say "No. Eat more." I've been pushing myself past fullness for them, and I just feel a little uncomfortable with this situation. Any tips for confronting them and building back their trust for my fullness cues? Thanks!
I relapsed hard about a year ago. I have dealt with multiple deaths and did a thirty day yoga challenge that was really triggering. I also manage a boutique and have been struggling to find another gig. My partner and my counselor have been blind weighing me. But I am having trouble with eating and I don't trust them about my weight. I feel like I am being lied to. Not fun. I also am starting to question if the weight-restorative model was the right way to go. I did a day treatment program from March 2014 to May 2014 where we were given a model to measure and count calories that were consumed in a certain amount of hours. It felt like as soon as I walked out of there, shit started to fall apart. I recently did a free screening with someone from a different treatment center in Elmira, NY who told me that seeing the number of calories while being weighed without knowing what is up heightened anxieties that I had about eating and my size. I feel like I don't know what is real and it is allowing my ED-voice to fill in the blanks. Does anyone have experience with non-blind weighing (learning their weight)? What should I do? 
My little sister started showing eating behavioral changes around 2 years ago. No matter how much my mother, I (her 24 yr old brother), or our sister and father help out she has maintained an anorexic diet and has been distancing herself emotionally from us. Every day it's like there's a dark cloud above her and it extends to the rest of us. We love her and do so much (make sure to wait until she comes home from school to eat a snack and then dinner together; my mom (a pediatrician amusingly enough) has been taking her to a nutritionist, psychiatrist specializing in adolescents with eating disorders, and my sister's own pediatrician, but not much has changed in these two years. We've even had interventions where we all sat together, told her how much we love and care about her, and how much she's damaging herself. The mood of the household is so much different now than it was a few years ago, and it saddens me. I want my little sister to be the happy, bubbly girl she used to be. I'm a med student and I know and have seen in rounds the damage anorexia can produce. It's horrible, and not something I want my sister to experience. The long-term effects may be permanent and it just kills me to think that she may already have damaged herself to that extent. How can I and my family help her? 
About 2 years ago I entered treatment for my eating disorder. At the time I was restricting and at a low body weight but my disorder has been around for almost a decade and started as bulimia. When I left treatment I was in a better place but looking back I'm not sure how "recovered" I really was. My weight dropped slightly after leaving treatment but remained steady. However in the past few months I've dropped down to my lowest weight. The restriction wasn't intentional at first, I was taking meds that killed my appetite. I'm trying to lower/stop the meds but I'm so scared of gaining weight and feeling hungry. I feel like I've wasted my time in treatment and I'm back to square one. I'm seeing a nutritionist, therapist and psychiatrist but I'm worried if I don't gain weight I'll end up back in treatment. How can I conquer the fear gaining weight so scary, how do I get rid of this forever?
Please let me know if this is the right spot. Sorry for the tangent. This is new and confusing for me. If posted, please keep me anonymous. Thank you for any and all help/ guidanceLong story short(ish), I've been trying to lose weight in a healthy way because I was overweight, I began to lose the weight, then the weight started coming off very quickly, I reached my goal weight, and the weight still kept coming off. Within months I ended up being underweight with a fast metabolism and next to no appetite. It turns out that when 2 of my medications are combined they act as diet pills, and when you add the third it's apparently a "super" diet pill. No one warned me of this. So now I'm on high doses of heavy medications (that I need. They're the only ones I've had success with) and no food in my stomach. Bad combo.Here's the other problem. According to my doctor, my body is physically and mentally showing the signs of anorexia due to starvation (brain fog, exhaustion, weak, feeling faint, black outs upon standing, thinning hair, hypoglycemia was a prior issue, heart rate issues, the list goes on). I started drinking boost and I'm trying to eat small meals throughout the day but food is just so unappealing to me. I will get a stomachache just at the thought of eating a lot of the time. This includes when I'm hungry. I'll be starved, finally find something that's appealing, eat 4 bites, still be hungry but my stomach won't let me eat more. It feels like a mental and physical block. I don't know how I got to this point because I've always loved food. Any advice beyond "see a doctor" (I'm what keeps doctors in business...) and "just force it" (I can't afford to force it, get sick, and end up dehydrated on top of everything else) is welcome.edit:The op /u/8plur8 has asked that you pm them when you reply. Thanks!
I have a LOT going on (grad student and life is hectic), and I already had poor eating habits prior to all of this. I guess you might call it UNintentional intermittent fasting. I have always had some preferences as far as texture and temperature (warm is always more appetizing).I have anxiety/depression, and that (previously) untreated caused some more food weirdness for me. My empty stomach turns on me now, the nausea much worse than the original dull ache, Ive even thrown up a few times from not eating (body, no, stop). I had previously been self medicating with mj which helped the nausea as well as my appetite (not to mention the anxiety and depression and mood), but sadly that was not a long term sustainable option. I decided to seek formal treatment for my anxiety/depression, and cycling through the meds has been a disappointing cycle, one helped a lot but absolutely killed my sex drive and sleeping habits, one made me sleepy constantly, some didnt work, etc. Im now on another handful of the stuff, and when I started one of the meds (welbutrin) it sort of amplified these feelings and habits a little. Appetite definitely dropped, it got easier to forget I hadnt eaten, less lust for food in general, more nausea (thats hard to gauge on a timeline). I also recently quit the mj, so that is in play as well. I am sensitive to the dosages so my Rx's are all kids sized, so lowering them isnt really an option. I know I can ask to switch again, but the welbutrin is my "work horse" med, plus I already have another SNRI to try, and this is all happening as the next semester of grad school and clinical start... tomorrow. Plus psychiatrist is booked 10 weeks out anyways. Switching meds is a little traumatic for me, the taper up/down process for some of these is maddening (brain zaps and MORE APPETITE PROBLEMS YAY) so Im not very inclined to ask to switch yet.So here I am writing this, 6am and I havent slept yet, although I have a rumbly tummy and food looks/smells absolutely nauseating right now. Boyfriends get nervous when they see me eat so little, so I try to shove some down to make nice since they made me food or are worried etc, but its hard. I try eating even when Im not hungry but should be, to try to retrain those hunger hormones, but it hasnt been something I can manage to do with any sort of success or continuity because I feel just as pukey trying to force myself to eat and its a really strange mental experience, not sure i can explain it.TLDR Medications, anxiety, depression, quitting mj, and a record of poor eating habits are about to hit me like a truck. Riding that trainwreck into a fresh semester of grad school. Need to learn to regulate eating somehow in a way that doesnt mean me feeling ill from undereating or eating when my stomach/nose/brain turns food against me. Looking for ideas and support on how to deal with this.
I know it is common for fat to accumulate in the midsection when a patient is being weight restored, but at what point does the weight "redistribute"? I have a friend who is experiencing this, and I keep telling her it will "even out", but I am starting to doubt that it will. She is heavier than before she became anorexic, but "looks fatter" than people of the same height and weight who weigh less than her. I am (obviously) very supportive and do not point this out, but I am scared she might relapse if it does not even out soon. To get to the point: Do some people maintain an uneven fat distribution after recovery? If not, how does the body determine when to stop putting it all on the stomach area? Thankyou.
I have a friend who is very strict about only eating healthily, she's a vegetarian (mostly vegan) and she doesn't eat anything with added sugar, so basically she lives off fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Some days (not often) she does have smoothies for breakfast or lunch but mostly she doesn't eat anything for breakfast or lunch. She says she eats plenty of food when she gets home in the late afternoon/evening, but I don't know if she's telling the truth about that or not, and she does eat dinner, I know she usually cooks for her family, but other than that I don't see how she can be eating a healthy amount every day with the amount of meals she skips and the fact she usually doesn't start eating until I think about 3 or 4pm.She really doesn't like people talking to her about her health (we've been friends for a long time and something else unrelated happened before and she got really upset when anyone tried to talk to her about it) so now I don't want to bring this up with her and end up making her angry or completely unwilling to talk about it, but I'm really starting to worry, she does look like she's lost some weight over the last few months and she was fairly thin before that.So basically I just want to know if it's at all normal for someone to just not eat until late afternoon every day, and I want advice on how I could talk to her about this without risking making the situation worse.
I have always been a fussy eater and I've went to many doctors are they've been literally no help, i want to try different foods etc, but i can't bring myself to do it.It ruins night outs and everything really for me and i need to break it. How can I begin getting help with this?
I am in recovery from AN and need to restore a significant amount of weight. I am eating a sizable meal plan to accomplish this, but now that I'm back at college after the winter break I'm finding it really difficult to keep on track. It's so easy to restrict when I have classes to distract me. Furthermore I find it really hard to eat when no one else around me seems to be eating. Obviously everyone eats according to their own hunger cues & schedules but so often I feel like I'm the only one eating and it makes me feel terribly guilty. On top of everything, i'm finding it hard to pack the volume of food I need! Weight restoration requires a LOT of food and I often feel like i'm hauling around half a grocery store in my backpack. How can I help aid my weight restoration process while balancing a full course load at school?
HelloI know someone with Bulimia and from the looks of her teeth she has been having that from a teenage years.She is a very sweet person.I don't know if I did wrong but I told her that I knew about her disorder and didn't judge her for it and offered my support.She didn't deny anything (apparently she previously denied it to someone else)She told me some personal things about herself.I told her that if she needs anything or support with anything that I would be there.But I did it a bit spontaneously and I have to admit I don't really know if I should start to slowly present the idea to go to a consultation about her condition if she opens up a bit more about it.Any constructive advice would be welcomed and greatly appreciated. How can I help?
I have been struggling with restricting for several months now (since July) and have lost a fair amount of weight. I have had trouble with this in the past, too (senior year of high school, 10 years ago) but handled it on my own. I have been thinking about getting help but am not sure how to ask.I have considered going to a therapist - I'm sure they would be kind to me but the idea of talking about food just seems too embarrassing. I am thinking about talking to my primary care doctor but I would have to talk to the secretary on the phone and say what the appointment was for, also I would have to talk to the nurse before I see the doctor herself. Also, what exactly would I say to my doctor if/when I talked to her?Have you found a way to benefit from therapy? How do I bring this up, and how can I get help while managing my fear of talking about certain things?I think I need help but I am really not sure what to do so any advice would be so appreciated! :-)
I've struggled with food since I was 15, from what I can recall. I am 22 now and have noticed some long term affects, I just need advice.I don't know if I'd classify myself as anorexic, as I don't know how much of my behaviour is learned or is stemming from something wrong with me. I've never been a big eater, and I often will get halfway through a normal portion and feel sick - hell sometimes it's two bites in. For example at 1:30pm last Friday I hadnt eaten anything in almost a full day. When I finally took my break I could feel my stomach turning and myself feeling that "I've gone too long without food feeling", I bought subway and got two bites into it before feeling sick and nauseated. Since Wednesday (it was Friday as I wrote this) I have only had a few very small portions. I've been doing this for years, but it's not that I don't want to eat. It's more of a every time I eat I feel worse inside than I felt before eating. There are times where i want to eat but just "don't have the time to". I put it off until I notice it has started to affect my cognitive ability.I've told a lot of this to my doctor and her response was "well I think you are just eating the wrong things" when I let her know that my appetite is very low she just says "well you look healthy, all your lab tests are fine" and brushes me off. I recently tested hypothyroid - she did not bother looking into WHY I am hypo, just focused on giving me a pill a day to fix it.There are days where I'll wake up and cook my boyfriend a full breakfast... I'll eat much less, not a full meal. I just loose interest, and often feel ill after just that. Sure some days I forgo more nutritious food for convenient snacks out of just an inner want. But the majority of the time I just don't want to eat anything.I've struggled with loosing weight all my life, and the majority of it would come from "junk" food and not much nutritious food. But it's to the point where I view all food as the same nutritionally. The reason I think this way could be because no matter what I eat I feel sick.Anyway, I'm just looking for advice as to how I can break myself out of this habit and maybe some ways that you all have dealt with similar situations with loved ones / yourselves. Any help, is greatly appreciated.
After submitting multiple posts and consulting multiple people who have successfully recovered asking what I could do to help my severely bulimic best friend, I finally told her mother. My friend told me something that particularly alarmed me, so I sent a LONG Facebook message explaining what was going on. The next day, my friend told me that her mom had asked if what I said was true, she had said no, and that was that. So I followed up with screenshots that proved I wasn't making it up. Nothing. They're both in denial. Not only is my friend (who is over 18) not getting help, now she's not talking to me because I violated her trust. On top of that, one of her other friends messaged me to tell me that I'm a bad friend and that I'm making everything worse. I hate this. I hate it so much. I always said I'd rather lose her to anger than to bulimia, but I figured once I told someone she'd finally get the help she needed and things would be okay. I was wrong. Everyone told me there were no easy solutions, but as it turns out, there are no solutions at all. Can anyone offer me some encouragement or advice?
I'm 18, at the end of spring last year I started clearly getting an eating disorder. Thought it was anorexia for a long time and maybe it is but I feel like it isn't so yeah.. * I've gone from a pretty healthy weight to very very thin in about half a year because of it  * food disgusts me most of the time and I can't be around people who are eating (not in a misophonic way) because I just hate being around food  * this is the MAIN symptom that makes it scream "not anorexia!!" To me.. The #1 reason I don't eat. I have this HUGE paranoia about getting a stomach ache when I eat. It never happens, in fact spicy is my favorite kind of food. But I am scared to eat because the thought going through my head is "you're gonna get a stomach ache don't do it don't eat" and like I said I never get them. Sometimes my paranoia gets so bad about it that I think I have a stomach ache for real when I don't.  This makes eating really hard, I'd love some advice on what the hell this is... Thanks
I am a middle aged female who has a history of anorexia and bulimia. When I became pregnant the first I was able to kick it. I was OK for 13 years after that. I was overweight for many years and then I started dieting. Extremely restricted diet... Extreme exercise. Of course people were complimentary. Then it got out of hand.My kids started to notice I wasn't eating. (my husband really is clueless at this point.... He's just happy I'm skinny again) So for the kids sake I try to eat... But i can't. I do eat but I have to purge right away.I'm scared.... I am so embarrassed to tell anyone. Can anyone suggest a next move for me?So now it's a year.... And my kids are so proud of me for. the loosing weight....but I'm a fake.
Hello! Im an 18yr old gal struggling a bit, I previously was diagnosed with EDNOS, mild depression, and GAD when I was 15, worked really hard to build a normal relationship with food, be healthy, and love myself. Everything had been going really well until completely unexpectedly my boyfriend who I still am very in love with broke up with me. He was a big part of my ED support, always made me food since he lived with me, and made me enjoy going on dinner dates! But since the break up my mental illness has gotten out of control, i'm very anxious, depressed, and having suicidal thoughts (which i will not act on) for the first time in my life. I have not been able to eat. I have no interest in food what so ever. Im not actively trying to be thin like I was when I was really struggling with my ED, but I am now at my lowest weight ever and don't know how to help myself. I've tried snacking lots and drinking supplements. Its just too hard to gain weight when i have absolutely no will or interest to eat. I'm on an antidepressant and feel seeing a therapist (again) won't be very helpful, I know all about my problems and why I am depressed and anxious and what it stems from and everything. Do I go to an ED treatment facility? Who can help me at this point? Because my GP sure doesn't know what to do.
My girlfriend likes all types of foods and will eat with me for some meals. When we do eat together, sometimes she will say comments like "This is the first thing I've eaten today" and it concerns me.Other times, especially during breakfast (which she rarely eats) she will take two bits of her meal and then say she doesn't feel good and can't eat anymore. I've asked her if she could have some sort of allergy or celiacs but she says no. She just feels nauseous after she eats any food.I don't know if she's anorexic or if she just really doesn't like food a bunch! She is very, very thin.Its hard to tell what to do or whether or not she needs help. I don't know if she is healthy or not. 
I can't stop binging. It's like clockwork. I binge after a week of conforming to diet and eating healthfully. I promise to never to binge again and hit my macros for a week. I binge once more. Rinse, repeat. Every fucking week. Its so easy to resolve to not binge while I'm eating healthfully but then I enter some state of mind and I can not stop eating. In the past, I purged after with exercise, restricting the next day, or sometimes throwing up, but lately I've given up. I'm so sick of it. I started my cut in September to lose a small amount of weight. Simple, right? Instead, I've succeeded at gaining more weight. I think I should stop tracking calories but MFP has become my obsession in a way, using it provides me with comfort and stability. I could use some guidance. (16F btw)
Since I was young I have had a lot of anxiety around food and body image. I have used myfitnesspal for years which both calms my anxiety and feeds my fixation. Whenever I have gained weight I have crash-dieted it off and then gone back to maintaining. However, the goal weight that I like to maintain is at the high end of the healthy range (I like having muscles) so I haven't felt in danger of bad health effects from my food issues.Lately though, I've been going through a tough time with a breakup, bad injury, school stress and some weight gain. I also accidentally found a proana forum online (I'm not kidding about accidental. It was linked in a circlejerk Reddit thread!). Since then I have been checking proana sites hundreds of times a day. I'm eating less than ever before and my usual weight is starting to strike me as fat. All of this is having a negative effect on my other goals, especially finishing my dissertation. I want to stop reading those sites and go back to my (somewhat) more healthy eating habits and goals. But the proana forums are so welcoming, eating little and losing weight quickly are satisfying, and I feel so sad and stressed that it's hard to turn my back on these things!Any ideas? I already go to a therapist for anxiety and depression, but I'm usually pretty cagey with him about food, and in the past whenever I've brought up food issues he has said the most unhelpful things. I'm also deeply ashamed of all of this so it's hard to talk to anyone about it. 
My eating disorder stems from anxiety. I cross posted this in /r/anxiety but I wanted to post it here because I really do think it's something with where my body was when I was at my most anxious/lowest weight.For about 3 or 4 years, I've been having regular (as in, hourly) short "bursts" of dizziness and slurred speech. My fingers and sometimes my toes/feet will often sort of clamp up uncontrollably as well, like I'm not in control of my actual nerves. These bursts last about 3/4 seconds, and usually happen when I stand up or when I'm walking. It's quite similar to a headrush from standing up too fast, but with the slurred speech and weird finger cramping added in.The last 3/4 years when this started happening have been the worst (in terms of anxiety) I've experienced. Some people close to me died which I didn't deal well with and I just completely lost my appetite for a few months. I pretty much became scared to eat because my anxiety stems from a fear of vomiting and I thought that eating anything would cause me to vomit. I was quite underweight at one point but I gained what I needed to this year and am now in the healthy weight range. I now get enough protein and water. I never get ill or get headaches. As I said, things were terrible, and I hardly left my house, but this last week I finally managed to go to the doctor to get a full blood test done and he said I wasn't deficient in anything and that all my organs were fine. This surprised me because I thought I might be dehydrated or anemic at least, or diabetic at worst.Does anyone have any ideas about what it might be? I can't be certain, but it does happen when I think about it. I don't know if this is because I feel it coming on and then I think about it, or if I think about it and then it happens, like some kind of tick. If anyone has any ideas I'd really appreciate it because it's happening quite a lot and I feel like a fucking idiot when I'm slurring and almost stumbling over if I try to keep walking.
Because my relative has guardianship, I am being forced to go into inpatient treatment for anorexia even though I am 18. I am not told where nor exactly what date. I'm not ready to recover right now, so I'm very nervous about it. My main questions are:How much weight will I be expected to gain? Will it just be up to the normal weight threshhold? Do I have the right to refuse to eat? If so, to what extent can I refuse to eat? If I adhere to dietary restrictions by choice, will they cater to that? How strict are they about exercise? Will I be allowed to have my phone? What was your experience like? Did you want to go, and did it help?Thanks. 
So, in the beginning, I started to get guilty about any kind of food I was eating in high school . Then it eventually came to purging. I started purging in senior year, which has continued into half way through my sophomore year of college. Whenever I do eat something, I then feel guilty about it and I just want to purge. No matter what it is. I can't talk to anyone about this issue since they'd get mad at me. I don't know what to do or who to talk to without sounding crazy or where to go for help. 
I don't know where to start with this... My sister is currently 21 and lives with our parents (I'm 23 and live 4 hours away by myself). When she was 16 she attended a boarding school and during this time began self-harming and had a short period of time where she didn't eat enough, because she wanted to lose weight. Since then she has gained weight, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and has been through a couple of bouts of heavy depression that she is getting treatment for. About 10 months ago she started losing weight again, seemingly in a healthy way. Recently, while I was overseas for a study-program, she was hospitalized for around three weeks due to prolonged severe insomnia - with which she still struggles. Before I left for my study program, I visited home and noticed she sometimes went to the bathroom right after eating. I am now back and this behavior is now happening after every meal. She will stay in the bathroom for a while, flush several times and afterwards there is cleaning product in the toilet. She does not appear to be binging however, and eats normal portions (however less than she used to). She is slightly above normal weight.My sister and I have never been very close. We never disliked eachother, we just never seemed to speak the same 'language' in the sense of interests, humour or affection. We haven't bonded over or shared anything in a long time and we have had no previous discussion of her (or mine) thoughts/feelings towards her mental health. I do love and worry for her though, and I'm scared of what to do about these new symptoms as she can be very hard to approach. I am unsure of when/if to involve our parents, as they seem to not be aware of this behavior yet (I think it may be a matter of time). They are very supportive and truly doing their best to help her with her depression, but I think she is ashamed about her problems and often clash or react coldly/aversively to talking or sharing with them. She sometimes does confide in me about things, mostly about issues with other people, that she does not want our parents to know about. I'm scared about placing even more strain on her relationship with them, if I alert them to her abnormal behaviour around food.I want to let her know that I've noticed and encourage her to talk to her psychiatrist about this, but at a complete loss of how to broach this topic with her without making her feel threatened or lessen the likelyhood of her seeking help. Keeping my parents out of the loop doesn't feel right either, as they are the ones who are most around her. To make matters worse, I have limited time at home, and even less time available to get alone time with her due to family visiting and her high need for defending her privacy and personal bubble while in our home. Please, any kind of advice or even just reponses would be highly appreciated. Thank you.
I have been diagnosed with Nocturnal Sleep Related Eating Disorder...I sleep-eat. I binge while completely unconscious, and feel so sick in the mornings that I can't function. Are there any approved treatments besides prescriptions for this (sedatives have only exacerbated the condition)?
Hi, I've been struggling with undereating for over a year now and was looking into getting into an outpatient program. However, after going through the initial interviews and etc. the center I was planning on going to said that since I am medically unstable they cannot allow me to do anything other than inpatient. With the spring semester starting soon I really cannot do that. My medical results were not THAT alarming (though I am underweight and had irregularities in my workup) I was wondering if I really started pushing myself to eat more could I stabilize myself and possibly do outpatient or should I look into other options? 
My fiancee has bulemia, and it caused a seizure that put her in a coma for 4 days this summer. We worked hard to get her into an inpatient facility, and then she refused to go last minute. All the outpatient facilities in our area then turned her down because of the coma... they said her disorder was too severe. Now it's Christmas and she's stopped going to therapy entirely. All this time, I've been seeing a therapist specializing in eating disorders so I can get advice on how to help her. But now I'm the only one still trying, and her bulimia is worse than before. I know our relationship is ending, but I can't leave for fear that something will happen to her and no one will be around to help - the only reason she lived last time is because I was working from home that week and was able to call an ambulance immediately. I'm at the end of my rope, and I feel like I have no one I can talk to without humiliating her. Help?
I was wondering if you could post my beacon for help-I have BED and am probably going through my worst period of it ever. I've never felt so out of control and helpless (although I'm in therapy and on Vyvanse)Does anyone have any insight as to how I can feel more in control and ways to kick the urges to the curb? I'm at the point where I'm so ashamed and self conscious, that I barely leave my apartment.edit: Please PM the OP, /u/SheWeeHerman, when you've posted.
My question is about handling medical leave for eating disorder treatment in a professional career.I've made the decision to go back to treatment for the first time in over 5 years, and have suffered with anorexia nervosa since I was 13 years old. This time, instead of being a high school student, I work full time as an IT systems engineer. My employer offers generous insurance/medical leave (3 months, paid).My treatment will most likely be partial hospitalization 5 days/week. The only person at work who knows anything about this is my manager, because I had to decline taking over a customer account and said I may need to go on a leave of absence to receive medical treatment and couldn't commit to the account yet, didn't mention anything specific.Obviously, I don't want anyone at work to know why I'm gone, and ideally not even notice I'm gone(huge corporation, huge office). I have to set an "out of office" notification for anyone sending me emails since there are things people rely on me for and don't know how to word it so coworkers don't worry about me or gossip.Could anyone provide tips/personal experiences for handling treatment while in a professional career? Also, how to word the "out of office" email to not raise any flags for nosy people(could I just say I'm on PTO, because it technically is paid time off)? Usually, the advice I read is aimed at students leaving school/university for treatment.
Help! I'm pretty sure my elderly Mom's Live-in care-giver has an ED. She's in her 60's and has been leaving shockingly-messy vomit & diarrhea in & around her guest room / toilet (the other caregivers use this en-suite bathroom too, during their shifts) and in another toilet in the utility room. Other caregivers have noticed the messes as well. We are all terribly worried. I think she's had an ED for decades: among other signs, she's extremely thin & her teeth are so bad she wears a tray. Equally concerining: I'm very worried about hygiene as she cares for my Mom and prepares food. She also works in food service. We are all extremely fond of her plus, she's very talented. But her ED and its effects on her personality and decision making have often been an problematic. She's FIERCELY independent and defensive so I don't think she will be easy to approach. We've danced around the issue for years (she breezily claims it's merely trouble gaining weight) but it now seems like she is getting way worse. I can explain more of my observations if needed. I can't understand why she would not flush & clean up her toilet? I can't find anything about this type of situation (Care-giver who has restricting with purging ED) Advice??? 
Hello all, I could use some advice. My girlfriend has been wrestling with her ED for about 7 years. When we started seeing each other about four months ago, she was in therapy, seeing a GP and a nutritionist. She seemed very happy, she was putting some weight back on (which was very necessary) and I made sure to be supportive and positive. In the past month, she's ceased seeing her therapist and nutritionist, her GP is concerned based on tests, and she's slowly and surely pushing me away. No visits, hardly any contact at all. In her defense, it's a rough month for her; holidays always bring family problems to light, but this month also marks the anniversary of her friend's passing. I offer to be there is she needs me, but I try to respect her space. It's at the point now where several days will go by, and if I try to talk to her or see her just for the sake of seeing her, I'm attacked. She'll say something like, "I sent you articles about [bumilia and relationships] and told you I needed space." That's fair, I can't argue that, and don't push the issue. She says she wants this relationship, but really, it's not much of one at all these days. I'm virtually non-existent. Call me selfish, but I'm trying to protect myself from getting hurt (I can't stop wondering if I should stay or go at this point, which I obviously don't want) while trying to be supportive of her, hoping there's something I can do to help her find her way back to her recovery path. Is there anything I can say or do that won't set this powderkeg off? What's the line, and how do I walk it? Any help is sincerely appreciated.
Geology is an unstable career where you often have to work in remote or isolated areas away from your home town. I'm looking for advice on how to manage an ED relapse when I am in a small town with zero resources.
My girlfriend is anorexic. Its not as extreme as things I've read about. however its been going on for some time now. she used to starve herself, work out before school, and then again after school. now she's slowly recovering. when we go on dates she eats just like normal, but when she's on her own or pretty much whenever she isn't with me she doesn't eat. she knows that she needs to gain and she's been trying but I just want to support her as much as possible. she attends therapy 3 days a week, but she's getting sick of it because she wants to travel. any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I love her to death and want her to be healthy
My 16 year old sister-in-law has been in the hospital for AN since collapsing in September. She was sent to a program that specializes in AN in late October but was sent back because she refused to not leave the facility unsupervised. This has made me feel like she isn't sincere about recovery because that was the one rule at the facility and she consistently broke it despite numerous warnings because she "wanted to be alone to think." She has no problem following the rules and not leaving the hospital unsupervised at home.While I fully believe that her AN is real and serious and not a choice. I think that she hasn't made the choice to get better yet. As a former teenage girl I remember the desire to perpetuate teenage angst and I feel like, at least for right now, she is stuck in that mode. Not wanting to get better because she is not ready to move on from the "poor me" stage. She has also told me numerous times that she can't get better because she doesn't have a good support system. I've told her multiple times that whether or not that is true doesn't matter, you can't rely on others to make you better. You have to do the work yourself and part of recovery is learning to find the strength within to overcome your illness.Anyway, I mention all these things because I am torn about what to do for Christmas. I don't want to reward her hospital stay and enable her to not choose recovery. With that in mind, I was thinking of offering her a girls day when she's back home. Something we could do to bond that she could look forward to coming home to while she's at her next program. But I don't want to do anything that would be a detriment to her recovery. Would it be bad to take her to get her hair done and a makeover or is that counterintuitive to recovery? Am I off base with offering a gift for after she completes her program?
For the first time since my eating disorder began 5 years ago I have not binge/purged or gotten sick after eating for 50 days. Even just in May of this year that would have been a daily thing. So thats a huge thing, massive, insane, and Im almost at a healthy weight too, just the tiniest bit below the bottom range of a healthy BMI.. But the problem is I dont feel any better, I feel miserable all the time, I hate myself and I hate the way I look and I have all the issues I had before. I dont know what to do. I feel so fucking disgusting and ashamed, like I cant bear the thought of looking at my family when I go home for christmas and like the weight will just spill out of my clothes and everyone will see. Has anyone been here and it changed? I feel alone and miserable.

I have been dealing with a restrictive eating disorder since last winter. I have been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I have not been diagnosed with a specific one, I'm thinking it's very similar to anorexia if that's not what it is. I am about to begin a recovery meal plan. I was wondering if anybody has any insights as to what I should expect in the recovery process. I am not sure what it's going to be like to eat until I'm not hungry anymore and what that will do to my body. It kind of freaks me out, but I know this is what I need to do.Thanks
I've noticed now that I've tried to stop purging, my body does it anyway, and I want to know if anyone else has dealt with this issue, and if they know how long it lasts or what I can do make it stop. I called my doctor about it, but she just said it will stop eventually and I have to wait it out, but it's still scaring me. It's making me feel like I'll never actually recover this, because now my brain can't even stop my body from throwing up. Has anyone been through something similar and can provide information? Does anyone know of any methods of recovery from involuntary vomiting? 
My girlfriend has an eating disorder and body image issues. She applied to work as a personal trainer. I feel like this would make her eating disorder worse. How do i tell her she shouldn't apply to these jobs without being controlling. 
Someone I know has a combination of bulimia and anorexia and is in pretty good therapy, I think. What I want to know is, what constitutes being in recovery versus the condition being in full force? How often can I expect this person to still be purging if she is working towards recovery? I know the DSM says that purging at least once a week for three months. Can I just assume that anything less than that is recover?
I think I have an eating disorder, but involving trying to eat when I cannot, not trying to stop eating or trying to get thin. I have always been thin, and have always had difficulties eating. I have never come close to thinking I need to lose weight; if anything, I am often thinking about needing to eat to get bulkier. When I try to eat, I feel sick, and if I force myself to eat, I feel like I am going to throw up.This is true for almost every morning when I wake up, I have difficulty eating anything. Drinking is no problem, I can usually do fine with a liquid or a smoothie. By lunch and supper, sometimes I can eat, sometimes I cannot. By the time it is late at night, I can usually manage most of a full meal, my problem is just during the day I am not capable of eating like everyone else.I do feel guilty and shamed when I try to eat and fail. I make many full meals that all go to waste.Usually I can solve this problem by smoking weed. Lately, however, it does not seem to be working all the time. I do also try to regularly weight-train, hoping to build up an appetite.2 years ago I was given medication for acid reflux, which did not help me. I have not been to a clinic or seen a doctor since then, since they were too convinced it was acid reflux and would not pursue the case any further. I took matters into my own hands and just continued smoking to eat instead. I did stop smoking for a month to record the results. After a few days it seemed to get better, but only a bit. I was not always able to finish breakfast regardless, just more often than usual. It did not seem to be the cause, as I have been like this long before I was smoking.I feel like I am starting to lose weight at an unhealthy level. Living in Quebec also means I have to wait 4+ hours to see someone (forget about that, I have to work like everyone else).Can anyone offer suggestions on what I can do?
I have Binge Eating Disorder, and recently came out of three months of treatment at a rehab facility for it. I learned a lot and if I follow what I learned and the plans I made I will find recovery. However I can't do it completely alone and after exploring the world of AA, NA, CA at the rehab facility, I want to find a 12 step group that I can work with. Unfortunately the closest ones are 1 1/2 hour drive away from me, but there's both EDA and OA. So far I think EDA is the better way to go as they preach balance which is in my opinion and those of my therapists the best way to overcome BED. However OA seems to me to be more established, and have a higher membership.I met one lady from OA who had been a member of 7 years and was adamant that being abstinent from sugars (her 'trigger food') was how she would find recovery but over 7 years she only managed 3 months of success. From what I've learned from various ED books from credited specialists in the field balance not abstinence from certain foods is the best way to have success. Was this woman just taking OA teachings and making it an extreme or is abstinence from certain foods something OA preaches?
I don't really know how this subreddit works exactly, but I'm sort of desperate here. I've been in recovery for about 6 months and lately I've been having strong feelings of going back. I don't know if it's from the stress of school or winter season approaching but I've been gaining a little weight from stress-eating and it's making me feel entirely horrible. Does anyone have advice on what to do when you feel like returning to old habits? I really want to be better but I can't seem to push it out of my head.edit: Please PM the OP, /u/alyssajulianne , when you've posted.
Hi all,I'm here today because I'm hoping to maybe find some answers or receive some input / direction as to what my situation is.I believe I may have some sort of mild eating disorder, but I'm really not entirely sure. I should start this by saying that I'm a 25 year old male, although I'm sure you'll get that in my next paragraph, haha.I was only recently clued into this possibility when I met a female a few months back that was in the recovery phase of her eating disorder (anorexia). She told me all kinds of different things, and some of which I couldn't understand (though I definitely tried and have been supportive of her).Anyways, some background on me growing up:I've always been somewhat small in size. I'm 25 years old, and I'm 5' 4" on a good day (lol). I am of normal weight. The odd thing is, I can sort of gain it, but I can't seem to lose it.Throughout my life I was always one of the smaller kids in school, growing up, everything. Sometimes I was picked on for my size, so that definitely always impacted me and how I ate, especially my nervousness towards eating in public.In 2014 I spent 2 months on work release in prison (for something pretty silly), but during that time I gained significant weight (from the poor diet), mostly in weird places. I noticed my face became thicker and my thighs and stomach got larger. I lost my natural "six pack" from being skinny. This has obviously bothered me a lot but I think I managed to just ignore the fact that it does bother me subconsciously.Now, here is where I'm actually going to get into symptoms..I've finally realized that I don't like eating. I have never liked eating, my entire life. Though I've gone through periods where I do enjoy certain foods. In general, I've come to terms with the fact that if I didn't have to eat and could just take a pill to get rid of the hunger, I would.I've always thought I was a picky eater, and I am, to an extent, but I noticed that I have safe foods that I go to. I will find things that I like and those will be the main part of my daily food intake for months until I get completely sick of the specific food. I will actually continue to eat the food even after I'm sick of it, I just eat it because I know it was a "safe" food at one point. I will often wake up in the morning very hungry, and think about the food I will eat during the day - something that seems really tasty. But once I get up, get moving, and get a shower - I'm suddenly not in the mood to eat. Yes, I'm hungry, I can feel it, but I just don't want to eat. Again, I don't like food. It feels like so much effort to even eat a small snack and force them down. But I am without a doubt hungry.Big meals are often daunting to me and I will pick through them or barely eat anything.I become very discouraged to eat by certain things that I may find in food. It could be a texture, something that once happened with that food (hair in food), or anything at all.I am nervous eating in front of people, because I don't want them to judge what I eat, how I eat it, how long it takes me, or how much of it I eat. I know these are all personal things I could probably deal with, but addressing them, I can see a problem. Just last week, a few friends and I went out on Thanksgiving to a restaurant and they all ordered food and I didn't have any input towards it. I just said "I'll eat whatever" - which is what I do ALL of the time, and then I end up getting food I don't like even more than the food I probably would've forced down anyway. I ended up having a few bites of the food that came, even though I was definitely hungry.I will often limit myself in how much I eat, even though I know I don't need to. That is a good thing and a bad thing. I sometimes feel shameful when I eat too much of a certain food.I frequently allow myself to become so hungry that the thought of eating ANYTHING makes me completely turned off by actually eating, thus prolonging my intake of food even more. When I finally do eat, I will eat a very small portion and be done with it. Only to be hungry an hour or so later.As I type this message, I have not eaten much. I am hungry at this moment, but I just don't want to eat.I'm currently living with my parents (that's a whole different story), so often times my mother will bring home dinner. Today she brought home dinner, and I'm hungry, but thoughts about the food and its texture makes me not want to eat food at all.My mom will also often cook certain foods and I will force them down even though I don't like them, or I will pass on them entirely and just not eat for the rest of the day. My behavior towards food is very strange, so I can't really pin point it exactly.Addressing these feelings is all very new for me, but recently I've been receiving medical help for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Because of this, I've started trying to take more of a notice in my behaviors and my emotions and start addressing them properly.Also, I'm aware that depression can often impact appetite and food. But even when I'm not having bouts of depression and lows, I still don't like eating and will avoid it until I absolutely have to eat (IE: feeling light headed, severely weak, sick).I'm under the impression that I can't technically be diagnosed with an eating disorder unless I am severely underweight or overweight (is this all correct? I'm not sure). And though neither of these are the case, I still feel like there's something more to my disinterest in food as a whole.If there is anybody out there that can give me some input as to what I'm experiencing, I would be so beyond grateful.Thank you so much for reading this!Darren
I'm not sure if I exactly have an eating disorder but I am aware that I have bad thoughts and behaviours about food.I'm overweight. I eat way too much.I don't know why. food tastes really good, I love food. Food is one of my favourite things and it hurts to think about reducing my portion size or refraining from eating certain things. I really don't want to do that. I feel like I'd be missing out on what I love because I can't eat as much of it as I want.I eat really fast, fill my plate up with more food than other people and will often have seconds and sometimes 3rds. Instead of 2 cookies, I will eat every cookie in the bag if I can. I have absolutely no self-discipline, no willpower, nothing to help me fight my urges.I even eat when I am not hungry at all. I will eat when I am bored. I will eat just for the sake of making my hands busy.I have tried to lose weight 3 separate times. And every time I've eventually given up and gone back to my old habits because I don't want to eat less, I don't want to restrict my calorie intake. I don't want to lose what I love; food.And I'm really not sure if seeing a nutritionist or a psychologist will make it better. because I know it's really bad for me, but I feel like I don't want to change my habits either.
My girlfriend has had an eating disorder for over 6 eight years. We started dating around about a year ago. At times its bad, and she throws up every few days. Other times, at least I think, she is able to handle it better. We have had many discussions about it, and I am always supportive of her and speak with her about it. She acknowledges its a problem, but constantly downplays the severity of it. She also suffers from anxiety.After she went through a really bad week, I told her she had to get help. Before this, I obviously was suggesting that she get help, but not being as forceful. I wanted her to know that I am there for her, and was afraid to push her too hard. She agreed to start seeing a therapist. She has been going for 2 months. She has still not told the therapist about her eating disorder, because she doesn't feel comfortable yet.About 2 weeks ago, she asked me to go with the therapist with her. During the session, we spoke about ways for me to best handle her anxiety and the problems within our relationship. But deep down, I knew that this time could be better spent and my girlfriend could open up to her about her eating disorder.There have been numerous times that I've told her that I want to tell her parents, or someone else, because I think I am the only one that knows, and I feel that I am not doing enough to help her. She has asked me to go to another session with her, where we will discuss her anxiety and our relationship problems. I was considering, during the session, to move the conversation, and hopefully have my girlfriend open up to the therapist. I worry that this problem will just continue, and she is just going to the therapist to appease me. I only want to help her. **Would it be wrong to bring this up at our next session, and force her hand in telling the therapist that she is not only suffering from anxiety, but also has an eating disorder?** If I told my girlfriend my plans, she would refuse to go, and beg me not to tell her. I just want to help her :( I am writing this just minutes after I heard her throwing up. **How do I help?** Sorry for the rant!
Hi there! I was wondering if anyone has experience with recovering from an eating disorder while participating in sport. I have recently started acknowledging that I have had an eating disorder for almost a decade now that I'm in college. I used to run track and cross country, but became a rower my freshman year because I was "tall enough for it." At the time, I was pretty deep in AN and very light/underweight, but I wanted to be strong and tough, so I rowed. I got pretty good over my novice year and gained strength and speed - but I also gained a lot of weight and exacerbated some really disordered eating habits, my BN and BED took over. I took my second year as a men's team coxswain, telling myself I needed less physical pressure to recover. (Yes, I was very tall for a coxswain. And much too heavy.) Needless to say, I lied to myself and really didn't get better. I ended up breaking my leg on a club run earlier this fall (freak accident/repercussions from years of AN and BED/BN) and I've been in physical therapy. I'm getting help and have had some difficult three or four months and I think I am actually getting somewhat better. I'm definitely going to be going to a campus group therapy (I unfortunately had a really nasty time with the eating disorder specialist at my Uni, which has one of the highest levels of eating disorders in the country, where she eventually just flat out told me I didn't have an eating disorder/seemed to positive and upbeat sometimes and too depressed and broken at other times/wasn't sick enough, and that wrecked me) and I ended up joining a sorority last spring when I was feeling super-alienated from the female population in general that has a big focus on positive body image and some of my sisters have experienced/recovered from a variety of eating disorders. I'll be living in with a set meal plan and never be alone (being alone is definitely when I start engaging in poor behaviour), so I'm really hoping that this will be the support I need.The real question: Will being an athlete help or hinder my recovery? I can't decide if I should join the crew team as a women's team rower at my university again this spring (obviously only if my doctor clears me). It's a club team, but we practice 5 or 6 days a week and we have a great deal of competition within the team to be fast and I also hold myself to very high standards. I am very hard on myself and I know that. It's all I've ever known in college, but I'm also worried it'll make my eating disorders and disordered behaviour worse. But I also don't want to lose my friends and my team and the feeling of being on the water. I'm extremely on the fence about it. On one hand, I know that rowing is part of what really made things worse in the first place, but the team is now made entirely of last year's novice (not as catty or petty as my year) and I am more aware about what I am struggling with. On the other hand, I'm afraid I'll have no structured sense of exercise or eating (or life, let's be honest) without rowing; I know I tend to skip meals and over-exercise (or binge and do nothing) unless there's something like rowing holding me accountable to other people. So part of me sees rowing as a viable way of recovery, while part of me is scared that I'll spread myself too thin again. If I place recovery and myself above competition and performance, then rowing could be beneficial. If I approach it with the idea that I'm rowing to get on the water, to be with my teammates, to spend one last semester in a boat - second to my health and academics and recovery - then I can do it. If I can't make that distinction, I can't row. I'm worried I can't, or that rowing will be a downward spiral. That's where my struggle is. Thank you for any advice you have <3
I didn't have a single binge for 6 months and now I had 8 binges in 3 weeks.....What are some strategies to use to get back on track?
I am a high school teacher, teaching at a new school this year. I've grown really close with a student recently and I'm concerned she has an eating disorder. Of course, it could just be normal girl things, but I wouldn't know. She sits in my office with me and my officemate during her lunch period, but she doesn't eat anything. She just drinks no calorie liquids. She also talks about food. A lot. I know what she's eaten 4/5 days of the week for her breakfast. She doesn't ever tell me what she eats for dinner though, only that she skips a lot of  meals. Occasionally, she'll buy something low calorie from the cafeteria, but she usually doesn't eat all of it. She also drinks 4-6 cups of coffee in the morning (she's only in high school!) and sometimes gets disoriented from all the caffeine. I've brought up with her that I'm concerned about her eating, and she mostly laughs it off, but she is concerned that I am concerned. I don't think she's actually concerned about her eating, just that I am aware of it. She has told me that she's going to stop talking about food because I pointed out she talks about it a lot, but she can't seem to stop. She's not underweight, either a healthy weight or just above, but I'm still worried. From what I've shared, do you think I'm right in assuming she has an eating disorder or that one is developing?Thanks.
I had a big binge yesterday. I tracked every calorie in MyFitnessPal. I've struggled with anorexia, orthorexia, and other body image disorders for the last five years.I essentially I ate several days worth of calories in the span of 12 hours. I feel disgusting. I just want to know how to get over this particular episode because I'm confident that I won't ever do this to myself again.
I haven't been underweight or extremely restricted my diet for about 3 years, after 4 years of dealing with anorexia. I'd sort of considered it over and done with because I've been able to eat most foods without feeling a crazy amount of guilt or counting calories and because I am physically healthy and fit. But certain thoughts, feelings, and behaviors resurface. Recently, I've been working quite a lot with long stretches between meals, and when I get hungrier and hungrier during the workday, it instantly sends me back to when feeling hungry was a reward. The reason I describe this as dangerous is that it has resulted in me fainting - multiple times in multiple unacceptable environments. This has me really concerned with my long-term health and wondering how I can stop it from getting worse. I technically eat enough in a given day, but apparently my body is more sensitive to lack of food, probably because of my history with AN. How can I keep this eating disorder at bay and prevent it from coming back and/or really destroying me in the long-term? Are there any mental/dietary exercises that could help? Articles or resources that could help me better understand AN?Without delving into my life story, I should add that I never received professional treatment for AN and there are few people in my life who know about it (or, if they know, they don't know how extensive it was). Because of this I haven't developed much of a medical/academic/professional understanding of the disorder other than moderate research.
Not sure if this is the right subreddit but during May-August I had an eating disorder. I lost a large amount of weight and was pretty happy, even if I was still obese. I got therapy at the end of August and I was pretty much recovered. However, I gained some of the weight back. I've tried losing it the healthy was but it just won't work. I've been trying for months and I have only gained weight. I am so close to going back to my ways of the summer, but I know it's not what's best. Please help, I don't know what to do. I'm still obese but I want to be healthy.

Hello there,I'm in ED recovery right now (anorexia for several years on/off), and have been able to slowly increase my caloric intake over the last two months. So, I know I shouldn't weigh myself during recovery, but while I'm still around a few hundred calories under the amount that I should be able to eat to hold my weight, I'm already starting to gain weight (slowly). I've moved to just over the lower limit of "underweight"...I don't think it's water retention because it has been going up so slowly, but I don't know. It just seems as if my metabolism is still so damaged that it isn't able to cope with the "surplus". How long does it take for metabolism to recover? Is it possible that it won't ever do so fully?Note: I have an underactive thyroid, but the last blood test showed that with the pills I take, the hormones are balanced right now.Thanks for your responses!
My girlfriend is developing anorexia. For the past few months she has been tracking her calorie intake with the app MyFitnessPal, with her life revolving around calorie intake. She gets visible upset if she goes near her "recommended" goal, which is a small number of calories, even though she should definitely eat more. Just today she went for a 8 mile run. She has lost body fat, most noticeably her with breasts and butt shrinking. I don't need any more proof that she is anorexic, but I can't get her to admit that she is damaging her body.I've come here to hopefully gain other people's opinions to hopefully help her in a more discrete way, as a last ditch effort before her family learns.She has not lost weight per say, which confuses me, but she has literally every symptom of anorexia nervosa. I just need help to help her, mostly for someone other than myself to warn her about what's she's doing.I apologize for being vague, but she is underweight or at least at the edge, and definitely not eating enough due to the stress in her life right now.I just need someone to confirm that she has something that at the very least resembles anorexia, so that it doesn't look like i'm the crazy one. She's crying for help in her own subtle ways, and even got me to write this.Thank you.
My girlfriend hasn't eaten for several days and she says even looking at food makes her feel physically sick. I've tried to talk to her about it and convince her to try and stop but she gets defensive and keeps saying there's nothing wrong. She wont admit that its starting to become a problem and i feel like i need to tell someone, but she says if i tell anyone she will never trust me again and she wont speak to me. When we have spoken about it she says she feels guilty when she eats and shes worried that if she eats anything she wont be able to stop. She thinks that its a good thing that she doesn't want to eat anymore. I think she's in denial about how serious this is and she needs help but i'm worried that she'll resent me if i do tell someone. How am i supposed to deal with this without upsetting her?
I noticed my sister (let's call her Jill) unhealthily losing weight a couple of years ago, as she was on the wrestling team and trying to make weight for her highschool competitions. I had a feeling about what was happening when my sister would disappear into the bathroom for long periods of time, but I did not confront her. My best friend and roommate at the time had been on the same wrestling team, and was battling with bulimia and severe depression also. Though I was not sure if this was the case for Jill and I was afraid of making her feel bad. In retrospect, I wish I had come to her sooner.Recently, Jill came forward and admitted that she was a compulsive liar growing up. First, lying about the simplest things that make no difference in our daily lives. Then it became worse, like telling family members I had an abortion when I did not. I didn't feel angry, just sad and I told her I really appreciated her coming forward and I want to do whatever I can to help her. She then admitted to being bulimic for the past couple years. She wanted help, but when she brought it up to Mom and Dad they both flipped out, saying it was her fault and if she wants to do something about it she has to do it herself.Jill has been silently struggling ever since, and I have been urging her to go to the doctor. I am about an hour away in University, but she is home still in highschool. I recently told her that I would bring her to the doctor, and get referred to a therapist. The only problem in money, and insurance. We get about 80 percent coverage on our health plan, but it is under our parents and they wont even take a second to listen about her problems. We are currently living in Canada, and there is a hope clinic nearby which has programs for people with eating disorders. That is what I am hoping we can get her into.Just wondering if anyone has any opinions on a plan or a way for me to get the info from my parents, or if theres a loophole where I can act as her guardian (I am 21 going on 22, Jill is 17)She will be coming to the same University as me next september, where they offer free counselling and health services- but we cannot wait that long.
I really need help and some insight into my husband's bulimia. He originally suffered from it over 10 years ago and it has now returned. I've tried looking online but would love help from this community. I met my husband early this year and we had a whirlwind romance and got married quiet quickly. His bulimia started again a few months ago. He was very unhappy in his job and was struggling to find another, there was stress from planning our wedding and new home, and him and I also had some issues of our own.We are now married and living together, he has found a new job that he enjoys, but the bulimia is still there. He binges every single night and then purges. I'm very careful with the way I approach him because anytime I've tried to bring it up he gets defensive. I've never made him feel bad or confronted him (I clean up the bathroom and never say a word). Another major point is our sex life. When we first met it was great, now it is pretty much non-existent. I went through the stages of thinking that its me, before finally realising that it might be the eating disorder. If any men can give any insight on this it would be greatly appreciated. I should add that he used to go to the gym and eat right religiously but that has also ceased. I know that his bulimia isnt due to body image only, but personal issues that he's gone through in life. I'm trying to be as loving and supportive as possible. But I don't know how patient I should be before I really intervene as I'm worried for his health. He takes tablets for the acid but that's all I know of. I'm struggling because I haven't known him for a long time so I don't know the best way to approach him and make him feel better. I've thought about speaking to his brother who knows about the bulimia to ask how he overcame it last time but I'm afraid because my husband will see that as a betrayal of trust if he ever found out. Is intervening the right thing to do? What options do I have? Please help. Any advice and insight would be greatly appreciated. 
I recently (a month ago) got into contact with someone that I've grown quite fond of. He's 15 years old, and based on some information he has shared with me, I'm very worried about his eating habits. These are my reasons:* He admits to severely undereating since January of this year (so 11 months now). * He counts calories and attempts to zero them out with exercise. I'm not familiar with his exercising (such as when or what types) except that it's only a tool for weight loss.* He began as overweight. According to the chart in the sidebar, it seems his current weight is healthy, but his goal weight (he has a range he believes would be acceptable) would be slightly underweight.I've confronted him about how he plans to maintain his weight loss once he reaches his "goal," and his answer is that he'll simply continue doing what he's already doing.His motivations are varied. One, he wants to be "smaller" than his boyfriend who is 3 years older than he is. Being slightly larger than his boyfriend bothers him significantly. Two, he's bullied at school, partly due to his weight. From what I've gathered, the bullying isn't overtly physical but emotional and passive; however, it is a daily occurrence. Third, I asked at the end of a rather emotional conversation about this topic if there were any other reasons for what he does, and he simply said "to prove people wrong." I think this references bullies but also his ex-boyfriend who he has mentioned was very abusive.I've attempted to encourage my friend to approach his parents, friends, his boyfriend, or adults at his high school, but so far those attempts have not proven successful. He does hide his eating habits from his family and friends, though his boyfriend is aware of the under eating but doesn't press the topic. Regarding his parents, his relationship with them is not very positive so relying on them is not something I view as a viable option for further suggestion.Why I'm requesting this post is to get advice on the effects his eating habits have or will have on his body, any creative ways I can help him even though I'm long distance from him (beyond just being available to talk), and if there are any resources he might be able to reach out to outside of his friends or family for help to lose weight healthily or to seek therapy. As a last note, I do know where he lives and could contact his boyfriend, a "close-ish" friend of his from his school, his parents, or the police in his city if I chose to, but doing so would likely lead to him cutting off contact with me.Any help or advice is appreciated, even if there are small things for him to improve on, or steps that you can suggest. My heart breaks that I can't be there with him to help him, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to just ignore the problem.
My friend often eats inedible things like plastic, sand, and glass, and they can't help it. Is there an efficient way to offer them support?
My girlfriend was treated for AN when she was 16 in an inpatient facility. She had struggled with it for several years however had recovered pretty well as far as I am aware. She is now 21 and we live together (I'm 27). She used (one year ago) to work a physical job on her feet all day in a factory and it was very physically demanding. When we started dating she had just moved to the city where I lived and gave up that job. That job naturally gave her a lot of exercise and she now works in an office rarely on her feet. It seems to me that she feels since she isn't on her feet that she has to make up for it by exercising. Everything was fine up until about six months ago. It used to be fine as she would exercise a normal amount and she would eat a healthy amount of food and not really count calories or watch what she ate. However slowly she has increased the amount of time she runs for and started counting calories and switching all the foods she eats to the low calorie alternatives. We used to go out to eat pretty frequently but now its pretty rare as she feels bad if we do and must over-exercise. Now she only eats food that is low on calories and its nearly impossible to get her to take a break from exercising. She is currently at a healthy weight but is restricting her calories and has been losing weight. She's always been open about the eating disorder and what she eats and I don't want to change that by confronting her about my concern. What has worked so far is that she tells me everything she's had to eat that day and I add up the calories based on what she and show her that she is not eating enough even without the exercise and that's worked for now but I know there will be a time when she will still feel she needs to exercise or she will start telling me she ate something and she didn't. Both will be bad. Her mother has also expressed concern about her eating and exercising habits so I know I'm not the only one who see the problem. I am about to start weight lifting again and I am pretty knowledgeable in the nutrition side of it and she has expressed interest in joining me. Which I could see as an opportunity to use to get her to eat to gain weight and muscle to take advantage of the weight lifting. However my concern is she will add cardio on top of the weight lifting or she will still continue to restrict her calories. Advice?
I'm SO nervous. I have had an ED for around 4 or 5 years and have been underweight for most of it. I was hospitalized multiple times. I had to quit my job because of it and was put on disability payments because of that combined with depression/anxiety and a rare form of cancer (that's a story for another sub/post though). For about 3 years now I have been seeing a therapist/social worker about it, and I made some progress, but I am no longer getting better. I actually may or may not be getting worse again. So my therapist has suggested she make a referral for me to an inpatient treatment center.Okay, fine. But HERE'S THE PROBLEM... The center is a 6 hour drive from my house in a different city. The program is 90 days long. I have a boyfriend that lives near me and a dog that lives with me.My boyfriend is literally the most amazing man in the world I love him so damn much it hurts, and he has done nothing but support me and love me and make me laugh and make me happy through our whole relationship. He is amazing and I don't deserve him. He has a great job, a great car, he is smart and understanding and patient. I am SO SCARED about being away from him for 3 months. I would miss him terribly, he would miss me terribly, and I'm worried he would get overwhelmed with me being gone for so long and break up with me. Or break up with me for other reasons, like the reason I'm gone or the fact that I'm so far away or that he can't have sex for 3 months or like whatever. There are so many reasons for him to just leave me. I'm scared of that.Now, for my dog. He is THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. He's a black lab named Zep and he's amazing. He's my best friend. He's gotten me through the darkest and hardest and saddest times in my life. He's been with me at my worst. We have routines we do every day, like his bedtime snack and stuff like that, and he sleeps in my bed and we cuddle every night. He hates it when I go somewhere without him, and I hate it too. Would he forget me if I left him with my parents for 3 months? Wouldn't he miss me? Would he be mad at me? I can't sleep at night without him in my bed. What would I do, just go 90 days without sleep? I just cannot be without my dog. I can't see that happening.On the other hand, I can't get better. I need help. I can't live with this ED forever.Any advise? Anyone at all? I don't know what to do. I feel lost and confused. Any advise or really any comment is appreciated.
My therapist said she won't be very concerned about my ED unless I become underweight.I'd have to restrict for a month before I get to that point. But I'm so sick and I'm suffering so much. I just want someone to help me. Why do I have to get worse before I get better? How can I get help if my therapist doesn't think it's serious enough?
I was wondering about the experience of others with pregnancy and post partum.I have BED and did really well with therapy and a medically supervised eating program before falling pregnant and the struggled with lapses into overeating, eating in secret, etc during pregnancy until I was diagnosed with GDM. Post-pregnancy, my eating has never been worse with almost daily binges. It's just been such a struggle to bring structure back and make healthful choices. I'd love to hear how there have fared, and if you have any advice for me. Did you have to go back to therapy?
My friend struggles with bulimia. I'm really worried. She already damaged her digestive system. What should I do?
Hi. I've had very severe anorexia for a very long time and have gone through multiple cycles of inpatient and refeeding. At present I am trying to weight restore from a underweight BMI outside of hospital for the first time. I'm used to dealing with most of the side-effects that go along with this process but I'm struggling with something I've not dealt with before: really sore teeth. It's not related to hot or cold. Many foods, even softer foods, are really unpleasant and uncomfortable. Does anyone have advice for dealing with this? Are there foods that might minimize this side effect? My teeth aren't particularly sensitive to hot or cold, but just to the act of chewing itself?Any guidance on this matter would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Hey guys,so, I have this friend. We are not really that close, but we do share one experience that makes us particularly close to each other: we both have invisible illnesses.One year ago my friend (who is overweight, but not obese) started a project to loose weight within the next 1,5 years to a number that would maybe maker her happy. Is has been going well, if one considers her illness and her circumstances. She herself says it's a food addiction (would this be classified as ED?) and that she goes to food for comfort, which she needs sometimes because of her illness. She made some healthy lifestyle changes. She's on a good track, with a few bumps. In August, for example, she gained weight instead of losing it, which caused her to be quite anxious about losing her progress, but otherwise managed to stick to her plan.But this month was her birthday and she did get a lot of chocolate and did eat a lot of it. She gained weight, again, and this seems to have put her in a somewhat desperate place. Today she told me that she not only has started changing her meal plan drastically, but that she also has started to take appetite suppressant pills.And I am becoming anxious. I have had friends in the past who dealt with anorexia and I remember that friend starting out similar. Still, I am not sure if and how I should intervene, seeing as I personally feel as if I have little authority on the subject of ED and weight loss (never had any experiences with both subjects myself). I do come from a family with a lot of overweight people, who are quite happy and don't care too much about their weight. I might lack the perspective of someone with ED/food addition and a heavy body, but I do feel as if there must be something I should say. I am afraid my friend idolizes weight loss because of her mental illness and strive for it on this way to feel happier once she is there, though she does not seem as someone who would ever be satisfied with herself. She has a very low opinion about herself, especially about her body and the way she generally looks. Maybe I am overly anxious because I have seen people drift into ED only after losing weight instead of being happy with the end result.I am not sure if this post fits this board. I am just looking for input from more experienced people on how to approach this topic with my friend, what signs to look out for and how to be a good friend to her, as she has been to me.Thank you.
My best friend has a severe ED. She is honest with me about the fact that she restricts severely, abuses diuretics, exercises compulsively, and purges just about every day (because I've struggled with anorexia myself and I understand). She's over 18 and I live over 150 miles away. I've said all the "right things" and I'm consistently supportive, but there are no magic words and she won't see a doctor because she says she's not thin enough for it to matter. Her mother knows, but they don't live together and she has no idea how severe it is. I don't know how helpful she would be, anyway. In the past she's been a huge advocate for recovery, but things have been hard lately and she no longer seems to want to get better. I'm honestly afraid I'm going to lose her. Is there ANYTHING else I can do? If she gets any worse, I'm going to regret being a bystander for the rest of my life. I can't lose her.
Hey I have a question for individuals who have made strides in their recovery of BN. I'm looking for ways I could help/support my mother.My mother (52F) has been struggling with BN for her adult life. She had kept it a secret for the first ~20 years of her marriage with my father (58M), but took a leave of absence from work to attend an intensive group therapy for ED three years ago (she realized after taking care of my brother who was diagnosed with AML that she had an issue that needed professional help). It was a ~16 week program through the provincial government and she felt during it that she was doing very well and she was more open about it.I know that part of her program involved her regularly seeing a therapist for her ED and relationship troubles and I think this helped a lot. I think she would benefit greatly by seeing a therapist again but a year ago my father had a cardiovascular event which caused him to be placed upon long term disability, and since this happened she has fully taken over the role as primary provider and housekeeper (I try my best to help but I get home after her) for our family. She doesn't have much free time during the day to attend therapy sessions, nor do I think she would want to (I'm not sure on the exact details of her previous therapy sessions but they very difficult emotionally and she also had a lot of negative emotions brought up in her marriage counseling sessions).But since I've moved back home to finish my second degree I've noticed more signs that she has been slipping into her old ways. I've told her (in private, no one else knows) what I've noticed and she admits that she still does every once in a while (I'm unsure of the frequency, but I know it is less then before she went into her program). I'd like to note that she has told me that she has a large problem with constantly eating when food is present (if she is watching the tube with my father) or if she is knitting in the den. I'd love to go shopping (I'm very practical when it comes to buying food, no frills for me just the things required for the meals) but since my father is at home all day, he does most of the shopping and my mom does some on her way home.I would like any sort of help/guidance that I could give to my mother in order to help her reign her BN back in check. It is very hard for me to see my mother struggle with BN because I know she has faced a lot of adversity in almost every aspect of life and through this she has developed an aura of confidence and pride that is infectious. But it's painful to see and hear her say how much she hates herself for falling into her old habits and how she wishes she could put it all behind her.How can I help her? 
I've dealt with this for the past four years. After healthily losing weight in September 2009, I started using diet products to keep the weight off. Eventually I started throwing up until I was discovered by my mother and friends so I read about chewing and spitting which is what I struggle with now. It has reached a point where I have spent thousands of dollars of food to simply dispose of. This has made it worse because I simply put it in the trrash, the garage, and my neighbour's trash can which has resulted in a putrid smell. I really want to stop but I have no idea how, I have caused my mother and my friends (who know about my problem) untold grief and I am sick of hurting them. I just want to stop but I do not know how...What do I need to do to break this habit?What kind of resources are available for this specific disordered behaviour?
I have had bulimia on and off from ages 12 to 19, then at 19 I had developed a severe perfectionist mentality. This is when things took a turn for the worst. Since that time [currently 22] I've gone from using behaviors a few times a day to once a month. I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression and was in therapy for two years and made a lot of progress. I recently moved away to school to get my Phd in biophysics. I have never felt happier than I do now, however there is a girl in my class who is not dealing with the stress of our first year as well. I do not believe she has an ED, but rather issues with self harm. I want to reach out and help her, but just thinking about bringing up all my old issues has caused me to have a slip up today. How can I help someone else when I still have trouble controlling my compulsions?Are there ways to take care of myself when someone else's struggles are impacting me?
I think I might be developing an ed. I have depression, so i didn't eat well, but now I'm starting to get better from that and eating better. But, I've been gaining weight, just a few lbs (still underweight) but I'm scared of gaining more and more. I've always been very thin just naturally, and I feel like it's a part of my identity or something and I'm scared and angry about losing that and becoming "normal". I've already started eating less on purpose. I don't want to spiral down this path, but I don't know how to stop it. I'm worried nobody will take me seriously. Sorry if this was too long.Can anyone offer advice?
I had a very bad eating disorder during my sophomore year of high school that included anorexic behavior. I underate until hunger hormones took hold and for a year I was caught in a cycle of binging and restricting, and later just occasionally binging. I gained back all of the weight I had lost and am now overweight.Towards the end of high school I was eating well most of the time because the food in my home was very healthy. However, I'm now at college and am facing several issues.I would like to focus on getting my body healthy. However, my school is fairly small and only has one dining hall, and the food here is...not so great. The food options are unhealthy and the healthier options are very limited, which I fear will leave me bored.I have a job but most of my money goes to tuition and my family can't afford to send me a lot, so eating outside of the dining hall is at most a twice a week deal.My problem is that when I'm not being healthy and eating healthy, I'm triggered and start to have major body issues, and resort to purging or binging. I just don't know how to eat healthy and not spend money here. I'm too tempted by all the bad foods and even though I try to work in healthier options as much as I can it's hard.It's hard for me to stay on track if I have a slip up and tend to suffer with black and white thinking, seeing the day as ruined if I've strayed. I don't know how to exit this mindset.Any help with any of these issues would be really appreciated. How can I get back to normalized and healthy eating given my circumstances?
I'm considering attending an art school a few hours away from home. They'll be making me board with them due to the distance. I'm worried that without my best friend and boyfriend around I will relapse in self harm or start up with my ED again (I've had EDNOS on and off for about 4 years now, it doesn't get nearly as bad anymore but I still have some tendencies of starvation). The two of them tend to keep me in check with my eating habits and notice if I'm avoiding eating. My boyfriend and I will most likely be breaking up at some point if I go as well so I know I'll be unstable for some time. I don't have self control without someone who cares around. Has anyone gone away to school or dealt with something similar? How can I keep myself from falling back?
I am a current freshman in college in recovery from anorexia and only a few pounds away from full weight restoration. College has turned out to be a great experience for me, I am happier and more socially connected than I have ever been before however the eating disorder is still an issue. I have a treatment team that I see almost weekly at the local children's hospital and I have weekly phone sessions with my therapist from home. A few weeks ago, my team wanted to send me home or admit me because my vitals were bad, but I convinced them to keep me here on the conditions that if I lose any weight or fail to gain for 2 consecutive weeks I will be sent home. I have a really great team and they have made it very clear that they want what is best for me and none of this should be seen as punitive and they always make sure to recognize progress that I make and set realistic goals.Its hard, but right now I have been eating my meals, drinking my supplements (ensure plus) and abstaining from exercise because I want to stay in school so badly. I've started to have anxiety around meals because I want to stay so badly even though eating is uncomfortable and I don't want to do it. I worry that my desire to stay in school could cloud my judgement of what is best for me, especially since I am over 18 so I can stop seeing my team whenever I want to, and my parents can't be involved without my consent. Besides the obvious scary medical things, what do you guys see as signs that somebody needs to return home or to treatment? I tend to minimize things and have never thought of myself as "sick enough" (despite spending a month and a half of last year in residential treatment and needing weekly medical evaluations).I'm scared of falling "off the wagon" because I want to so badly but I know that I will not be able to stay in school if I do not.
I need all the help I can get from you guys on Anorexia recovery. I am trying to do away with my food obsession/food restriction. I want to work with doctors and nutritionalists but I can't afford those resources. I like to workout everyday, and have always been active been before my ED (played sports my whole life). How much should I be eating? I want to listen to hunger cues but I don't think they're accurate anymore?
Hope this is the right place to ask what I can/should do to help, if anything.My recently hired coworker is throwing off some signs that make me wonder if she struggles with an ED. I don't know her nearly well enough to straight up ask her (I suspect that's not a great idea anyway?) and am not really sure its my place to do anything about it, but I feel like I can't just let her hurt herself if she truly does have a problem.Why do I (and others) suspect she has an ED?* Every time she eats a meal, she immediately or soon after excuses herself to go the restroom for a longer-than-typical time.* I'm told the women's bathroom often has poorly-cleaned up vomit in it...started showing up after she started. * I've had coworkers over to my house for lunch. After we ate she used my bathroom and I later noticed food particulate on the toilet bowl. * She's fainted before and has issues with vertigo* She has some throat and voice problems* She's not like crazy skinny, but she's definitely not overweight either.Now, to be fair, some things detract from my theory...she eats a completely normal amount of food, that I see. She complains about "getting fat" like a lot of people do, including myself, but doesn't seem overtly focused on the issue (and she appears to be a normal weight, idk how much she actually weighs of course). In my home scenario, the bathroom is close enough to where the rest of us were that in theory we would hear someone throwing up...is it possible to silently throw up??Like I said, I don't know if its my place to do/say anything. Maybe I'm way off base and she's just been struggling with illness these first few months or there's some underlying medical issue I don't know about at play. But I'm hoping there's something we could do to encourage her to seek help if she actually does happen to have an ED?Thanks.
I've recently become much better with my bulimia (very rare occurrences typically only when extremely stressed) and know I need to go see a dentist. The bottoms of my teeth are a little chipped, and in my mind, extremely noticeable. My boyfriend and close friends (who know the cause of it) all say it isn't bad and you can't see it. I just want to go in and get them either filed or I think they do a kind of tooth coloured capping cement for small chips. I want to be upfront about the issue so they can make the most well informed decision, but I have no idea where to start. Any help would be most appreciated. 
I'm new to college, first year there. I met this really nice girl who is a bit underweight, but very pretty. She has told me that she has bulimia over time. At first she was only saying she had an eating disorder in the past, then eventually said bulimia as the specifics, and then admitted she is still doing so "often". I am transgender, and have also told her that I self harm sometimes, but I am trying to stop as well.To be honest, I do not know a whole lot about bulimia other than the basics. I wanted to know how I should approach her about it more often with the correct phrasing and wording to help her. To me, saying something like "you look great!" or "you could gain a few lbs even!" seems correct, but I have a feeling that it could come off wrong but I don't know what is the better way to word things. How can I help someone who has these kinds of issues?
Last year, I developed a very bad relationship, and ever since winter break, I have been binging, and exercising to try and compensate for all the food I ate (which usually never compensates) and occasional try and purge sessions (which have become more frequent). I have injured myself many times due to over exercising, and I know if I keep this up, I wont be able to run soon. I am in college, and since I started developing a bad relationship with food, I have alienated myself from my friends. I really need someone to talk to, someone to help me out, but I really dont know anyone, and since I am a guy, it is very embarrassing. I do not want to tell my family (although they know I love food, and overeat often). I was just wondering, how could I meet someone at my school to help me get over this? 
I have been in recovery for bulimia for several years and I am doing very well. Of course I had the typical binging, fasting and purging but I also used exercise as a method of punishing myself for not being thin enough.As part of my recovery I was encouraged to stop counting calories, monitoring my food and exercising, I complied and after several years I became a bit overweight. For the past few months I have been working on taking that weight off. I set a healthy daily calorie goal and focused on eating more veggies and meats than I was before. I'm now at a healthy weight and dont intend to loose any more. My relationship with food and exercise has changed dramatically. Eating doesnt make me as anxious as it used to and I dont binge anymore, if I want something calorie dense one day I'll indulge in a little bit but not enough that I'll feel the need to purge.My workouts make me feel good and strong rather than drained and weak. I feel like my healthy eating and workouts are part of taking care of myself rather than punishing myself. I feel like I've adopted healthy behaviors but since I've reached this weight the "ED" persona has been a lot more vocal. I've been thinking about fasting or working out more and I've started fighting the old behaviors again and I'm worried about a relapse. I didnt have these urges a couple months ago and I'm very surprised to be dealing with this after all the progress I've made. Has anyone else had this issue and how did you deal with it?
To preface this, I want to say I've never been diagnosed with an ED, but I went to treatment (for depression, long unrelated story) and had a pretty good look at what I feel I am currently dealing with.When I was younger, my mother was very abusive and often used food as a weapon. We also ONLY ate fast food. I mean three meals a day. I fluctuated with weight a bit but was always on the thinner side until high school.I was 16 when I got the first "wave". I ate only 1-1.5 meals a day worked out CONSTANTLY. Really more like snacks. I dropped a significant amount of weight (from technically overweight to technically normal weight) in about 3 or 4 months.When I went in for depression treatment  when I was also 16, they put me on a lot of pills that equated ,to me gaining a lot of weight back. I was doing ok until last year and I lost several sizes in about 4 months.I HATE food. I want to stomp on it, burn it, yell at it, and just crucify it. I get super anxious whenever my bf forces me to eat. I try to eat oatmeal in the morning and something at night, but I just don't want to be fat again.It's so hard to describe how I feel. I don't really know how much to eat or when or what. I'm very lost and confused.I want to get better because I love my boyfriend very, very much and I want to be able to enjoy life with him. I know I'm bitchier and more tired, but I can't.What resources can I turn to? I have insurance, but I'm 20 with zero financial support from any parental people. What I make is not a lot. I don't know what to do anymore. I am very overwhelmed.
I(19) live in new york and my girlfriend (18) lives in europe. We've been going out since august but we had a thing since May. maybe a month or so ago she told me about her ED, and that she had never told anyone else, not her parents, friends, doctor, nobody except for me. She says she'll have long periods of time where she restricts to a dangerous level and her hunger cues have disappeared. almost 2 weeks ago she told me it was happening again. She hasn't been eating and the food she is consuming is making her physically sick. She told me she isn't purging as a behavior, but just looking at food makes her sick, and when she eats anything she can't keep it down. she told me tonight she hasn't been able to keep any food down in 2 weeks, and what she is able to consume is very little.she was telling me the other day that she's been trying really hard to eat and that she managed to keep down a little, but based on what she told me tonight, i think she may have been sick with that later that day. I want to help her and I've been doing research on eating disorders and I want to say it's AN but I don't really know. Based on photos, it does seem as this is making her lose weight.How can I help her?
I recovered from AN 4 years ago. The issue is, food was my coping mechanism before having an ED, and it is still a coping mechanism now. I'm still obsessed with food, organizing and storing foods, looking it up, comparing, thinking about it. I'll push other thoughts out of my mind to think about it and fantasize about eating it, especially when I'm nervous, insecure or wanting to clear my mind. I often prefer to eat by myself and if I've planned a meal I hate to deviate from it, but I do like to eat out as well and I'm a lot more relaxed than I have been in the past. People who get to know me will sometimes ask about my relationship with food. I don't feel like it will ever go away, or know how much it can go away - maybe it's something I'll always be stuck with, but as long as it's not dangerous, it's not a problem. :(How can I stop this obsession?
First of all, i am not currently seeing a therapist (they're expensive), and am wondering if i should.When i was in year 12 (16 years old), I found it very stressful due to study and started paying attention to my weight. I found i was gaining weight and started eating restrictively on and off. The combination of both the stress, as well as the restrictive eating made me begin to binge eat. During this time, i wasn't motivated to study and found myself under a lot of stress. Near the end of this year, i forced myself to eat a lot more restrictively and found myself able to study all day. Becoming more and more restrictive in my eating behaviour, i eventually found myself as anorexic (and extremely skinny). I went to see a doctor as i had not had my period for about a year who told me that i had to gain weight. This also alerted my parents for this first time, as they were there with me. So, i did gain weight and ate normally for a few months.However, after about a year, at my first year of University, I started binge eating (i think it was when i was stressed due to study). I met a fantastic person, my boyfriend, who supports me amazingly, however, when I am not with him, sometimes i lapse back into my former-self, losing control over myself, hearing voices convincing me to binge, and when i snap back into normality, i had already binged. I feel really guilty every time and this only happens when i am not with him. For example, once, when he was sleeping, the voice told me that it was okay to binge now because he didn't have to know, and that it would feel really good. That i could escape reality for a short while.I just want to be able to eat normally and not think about food. To just live life like everybody else.Any help or responses/kind words would be appreciated (this is the boyfriend and i'll relay any support)
My girlfriend has always struggled with her weight and in the past has struggled with an eating disorder (bulimia). I have seen no signs of this and she claims to have not engaged in this behavior in years. She is however trying to follow a diet but it's very off and on. She will go a few days but end up on a binge.My prime concern is how much she eats. She'll have a very small meal at breakfast and as far as I can tell doesn't eat anything else until 6pm when she will have a large meal. Her binges seem to be comprised of unhealthy foods. This seems to be a cycle she's caught in and I worry about her. Should I bring this up?
Ok, so I am 16 years old, male, and my GF (also 16) has had anorexia nervosa for about 6 months. It seems to be getting progressively worse and she is getting more lost as time passes.She has told me all about her illness and how she feels. Like the voice in her head which she is best friends with and enemies with at the same time.Right now, she says she is too tired to even try fighting her anorexia.She takes in one quarter of the recommended calorie intake per day for her gender and age, which she is adamant is perfectly normal.She goes to weekly counselling at the hospital (UK) and she tells me that it doesn't help her, and just makes her feel worse about herself. She also says she doesn't tell the nurses everything, which I'm sure is probably a bad thing.She has also previously self harmed and attempted suicide.Basically I want to know how I could motivate her to fight this and to try, because right now she is just embracing it. I comfort her as much as I can, but anytime I try to suggest something she shuts me out and doesn't listen.Should I maybe tell her mother some things? Like how few calories she is taking in etc? Because I know she doesn't know those details.Right now I am just lost and don't know how I can help. Someone please give me some ideas? Thanks.
This is my very first reddit post and first time on reddit. My husband has been on this site and has informed me that I may find more information here and assistance as opposed to facebook.I wish food and I didn't hate each other! Have 11 freebies for my birthday and am so overwhelmed by it! Wish there was some magic off switch to the part of my brain that says "you cannot eat that" or "that's a lot of fat and carbs, so can't do that"...I am debating seeing a nutritionist to get a meal plan going or to figure a plan. Whether I follow it or not is the question, but it would be easier then deeming all food as bad. A healthy relationship with food would be nice. Has anyone gone through this, Was it helpful?
My girlfriend for the past 5 months has had BED, very rare purging. She goes to a therapist but it doesn't seem to help much. She is currently reading brain over binge piece by piece very little. It tends to be during more stressful times she will binge more. She wanted me to post this for her as well. What can i do to help her? And how can she help herself? Please respond, i care so much for her and only want her to be happy.
For some context, we're in high school and have been dating a couple months. I've known this girl for almost a year now, and a few months ago she confessed to me that she that she wasn't actually a vegan like she'd been telling people, she was just using it as excuse to not eat when others were. Since we've started dating I've realized that it's a serious problem. She used to be overweight, but she's lost a significant amount since then. She appears to be at a healthy weight now, not underweight as far as I know, but she is still hardly eating and has body image issues.I want to know how I can help her, or get her the help she needs. I've talked with her about this many times, but I don't know enough to be able to make real progress, and I'm afraid of doing something wrong and discouraging her. I've been able to get her to eat a few times, but she has difficulty digesting most foods now after having practically starved herself for so long. I know that professional therapy is probably what she needs, but how can I convince her to get it? Her mom knows she doesn't eat much but doesn't seem to realize how much of a problem it is.I'm sorry if this is vague, but I'm lost on what to do and worried for her.

Hey, I'm a 17 year old male and I have BED, anxiety, and depression. Even tho according to the chart on the sidebar, I'd fit one the small figure, whenever I look into the mirror all I see is fat. Sometimes this comes and goes, and mostly isn't there if I just purged. Although it's there most of the time. My question is, how do I get rid of this "anorexia mirror" and see myself as I truly am, because I'm sure my image doesn't actually change this often. As well as the reason why it happens in the first place? Thanks for reading this and for any help or support I get.
I recently went vegan for ethical reasons and I've found that, as an unintended side effect, I don't feel the desire to restrict as strongly as I used to. I wouldn't say my attitude towards food is positive and I still worry about my weight a lot and have to force myself to eat sometimes, but I'm definitely doing a lot better than I was. Checking ingredients and having certain foods that are off limits is comforting and familiar to me too. Just being able to eat any food all willy nilly makes me feel out of control. I'm also working on goals around staying away from negative, being ok with gaining weight, and comparing myself to my sister.So obviously this is a good thing because it's helped me to start eating again (I haven't restricted in almost a month), but what I'm wondering is, is it enough? Is it okay to just replace all my bad habits with healthier habits and call myself recovered? Or do I need to eliminate my need for control and to be better than my sister altogether to truly recover?Whenever I tried to stop restricting in the past, I started having flashbacks of being sexually abused. I don't think I can separate my need to have absolute control over what I eat from my need to have absolute control over what happens to my body--period. Maybe this is just the little voice in my head that always needs to tell me that nothing I ever do it good enough talking. Or maybe this really isn't good enough. I can't tell. I just need somebody to tell me so I can either try to stop worrying about this and focus on my recovery or know that this isn't enough and...I don't know. I guess try to do more? I'm reluctant to try therapy because for me in the past it's only ever made things worse. I feel like even trying to let go of that control is only going to make me cling to it tighter and I might end up going back to restricting.
So my girlfriend has had anorexia for almost 5 years. She had been living with and has had a very poor relationship with food and recently exercise. She feels the need to balance eating with over-exercise.I got her to start going to a therapist around 3 months ago and the therapist has really helped her deal with some anxieties, but her relationship with food and exercise is still bad, but recently my girlfriend has started eating a bit more and exercising a lot less. I convinced her to go to a dietitian (hasn't seen the dietitian yet), but is now having severe anxiety towards the dietitian has gotten quite bad because she believes that because she is only a bit underweight, that the dietitian will think she is a liar. She believes that he dietitian will "laugh at her" and will tell her to leave. Now she is beginning to convince herself that she does not actually have an eating disorder because she is not severely underweight.So i guess my question is really what can I tell her to comfort her in terms of the dietitian and her not being severely underweight, and what can I do to help her with this?Thanks.
Hi, A few months back i made a post about my best friend who is suffering with her eating disorder and a not so supportive boyfriend. I'm happy to report that she has dumped said boyfriend but is still struggling with her ED. I love this girl more than anyone on this planet and i just want to see her smile everyday. I have noticed and stated it to her that she just wants to be loved like most but she is not looking in the right places and letting men and others use her and in turn at times using me.However she has been doing okay lately she has been eating well compared to the past but however i know her very well and she is not as fine as she says she is. She has fallen into a pattern of dating just sub-par men and although she thinks she's doing okay she is not as i know she is going to struggle with any rejection or feelings she obtains the only way she knows how.She and i have started to go to the gym again after her avoiding it for years due to over-exercising in the past. I am keeping a careful eye on her because i refuse to let her take control of her exercising habits again.My concern is that her father has returned to the picture and he is the core trigger of her ED. She gets these periods of time that last a week or two when he decides he wants to "fix" their relationship and i get thrown on the back burner and she won't allow me to be there for her and help and support her. She has coping mechanisms which include her ignoring the problem completely and distracting herself and it hurts me so much to see her do that to herself because when she sweeps things under the rug it all boils over eventually. I have tried inviting myself to her house and inviting her to mine so we can just relax and not let the ED become her support system as it often does. However it seems almost impossible to get her to relax as she is now working two jobs and is looking at returning to uni and it is clearly wearing her down.I'm tired of stepping on eggshells with her and i am reaching out to those of you on here to see if there is a way i can go about this because although i may not be her boyfriend, i do love her and she is treating me like one, aside from her letting me be there night and day. I want to be better than the ED i want to fight for her but i don't know how to when she won't let me in, regardless of how many times i tell her she can trust me and she knows she can trust me but her actions are not at all following her words.All suggestions are welcome especially from boyfriends of sufferers and those in recovery.
Hi. I have built up a relationship with a recovering anorexic girl, she does not know much about the reddit dynamic and I knew that it was a very good channel to seek out help for her.I met her outside of my office adjacent to a treatment center roughly a year and a half ago and we've been keeping in touch since. She's been a recovering anorexic for about 3 years and she's regularly upset about not making enough progress recovering from her eating distorder. She went from daily counsel treament sessions to a month's residency to tackle her conditions and she's gone through a very frequent shift in seeing different physicians, nutritionists, trainers and psychologists that have contrasting opinions about her eating regimen/recovery process.The other night she felt like she was going through a positive revelation with eating and wanted to discontinue sessions with her trainer so she could listen to her body tell her when to eat. She's currently seeing a trainer a few days a week and adheres to his strict diet schedule of daily caloric intake/exercise limits.She's very dispirited in this process because eating her same scheduled calories every day(it's been four months of this process) curbing any intense activity propels her into wanting to abandon this process. Her family has grown fatigued with her and she's currently staying with me, I love her and I want to develop a deeper understanding to best be there for her.What steps should we look into? Is staying with the trainer a good idea or should we consult a nutritionist? When is it safe to go back to eating normally after recovery? Thank you reddit.
My wife has had a BED problem since she was 16 (she's 32 now) which hits her in spurts. She can be fine for a few months, and then completely crash and binge for weeks in a row. She tries to hide it, but her mood during the day gives it away if she's binged or not. Normally, I just ask her how her day has been, which she normally replies with 'good' and changes subject. Sometimes she says she's had a bad day, and I ask her if there is anything she needs? She always says no.Lately her binging has been getting really bad, with her becoming increasingly depressed. She sleeps in late every day, doesn't interact with the kids as well as she used to, neglects her share of the house work, and has increasingly been less and less communicative with me.I have mentioned several times over the past year that we should go and see an eating disorder specialist, or attend group meetings, and she has always just said 'no.' However, since things have been getting so bad lately, I've been insisting on it more. She doesn't give me any reason to not wanting to get help, but does tell me that she can do this on her own. I have my doubts, mainly because she's been at this for over 15 years.Our relationship has gotten bad lately. We've stopped talking to each other. We haven't had sex for a month (we even had our third anniversary last week). She's always depressed. I sat down with her two nights ago, and laid my feelings on the line. I told her that she needs to get help, and the effect her depression and eating disorder is having on our relationship, and she just sat in silence. I came home from work late last night and asked her if she had given our previous nights conversation any thought, and she told me she had, but indicated that she's still not interested in seeking help. I don't get it, I lost my cool and I yelled at her. She left the room and disappeared downstairs, and I slept alone. This morning she didn't say two words to me before she left to work.I regret losing my temper on her, and I've never raised my voice at her before. However, I feel that my feelings are being completely ignored. I can't understand why, with our relationship and happiness on the line, that she still refuses to start a meaningful process to recovery. I feel that I'm being asked to just 'sit this one out' and let my wife continue her destructive behavior on her own time. I've never had an eating disorder or depression before, and I do struggle with understanding what such a negative relationship with food feels like. She doesn't share her emotions with me, so all my opinions on what she's going through are speculative at best.I love her, and I love our family, but I'm scared about the direction we are heading. However, I must insist on us getting her the help she needs, but she flat out refuses. What is my next move? Do I have a next move? Why is she so against making strides to help such a painful part of her life, and why won't she talk to me about it?Any advice is appreciated.
My SO of 1 year is recovering from an eating disorder and has had amenorrhea for the past one and a half years. We cuddle and make out but we have not had sex as of yet as I am afraid to initiate as I can tell that she has a low libido. How do i approach my desire for physical intimacy without affecting her recovery? I am concerned about telling her that i love her body, as she still needs to put on more weight to be healthy again. Also, is it possible for her to enjoy sexual stimulation and have orgasms while she is underweight?
I'm 27 years old. Over the last few years I've been to counselling on the NHS twice and privately once - ended up getting nowhere. I've tried a few times to settle into a 'normal', healthy routine of eating and exercise at consistent times since starting work full time after Uni 5 years ago, but I'm having difficulty.I find my motiviation to change highest in the morning, but often wane as the day goes on and find it increasingly difficult towards the evening. The thing I struggle most with is the routine - eating the same amount, doing the same amount of exercise. Doing the same things at the same times. Without this I tend to feel lost. Does anyone have any tips/advice/things which have worked for them which make things easier?I'm hoping to find a way to just enjoy a ready meal and a generally healthy diet instead of stressing about every detail - what I'm eating, when I'm eating, who'll be there, whether it has too many calories, whether I'll enjoy it etc etc.
I'm currently on only new 25mg of prozac everyday. I was anorexic and now bulimic. I was told prozac could help. So I'm just curious if prozac has helped anyone? I have a high tolerance, but I I'd love to hear other people's opinion about prozac.
I am looking for practical advice. My (25F) sister (21) has had bulimia for around 8 years. She has been living with my parents, and things got progressively worse until they now just pretty much live with it. As many people will know, like with any addiction, the whole family becomes ill. I have been living away for university, and have moved back to my home town to start studying again. I am living in a flat with my LT BF. We have allowed my sister to come and try living with us to see if being away from the family home, in a new environment could help. First few days she managed well, however, it is getting progressively worse, stealing, bingeing and purging starting up (my parents live down the road, so I don't think anything stopped anyway she just went there to do it, I think she was just able to hold things down for the few hours at a time she was here - which still IMO feels like a small win, at least there were a few hours a day of relief for her heart etc.). The original agreement was that if she couldn't stop here then she would go home again, and come back when she is ready. However, in practice this now feels so horrible to have to kick her out, and I feel we probably didn't work out the boundaries/guidelines/rules properly. So what I am asking for is if anyone knows what the boundaries are?? When is the line crossed? What are the repercussions? Do we send her back to live with my parents (who are really struggling under the strain of all this)? Do we (as some people have suggested) find a way to lock the kitchen at night? Lock my bedroom (so she can't steal clothes etc. another feature of her problems)? Do I discuss boundaries with her and let her help set them? Or as some others have suggested detach with love, and tell her these are the conditions (locking doors etc) of living here (without all the explaining and justifying and arguing)? I love my sister so much, and I am terrified everyday that she will have a heart attack and die. We are an open and communicative family, and have always been supportive of each other. I just wish I knew how to support her. How can I support her through this?
I am overweight and have been my whole life, except for when I was younger. Once I hit age 10 I started gaining a lot of weight, which led to me being made fun of for being bigger. I developed BN and I have been suffering from it the last 4 years. I am 19. I don't know how to go about getting help. They dont have any eating disorder help where I live, (like therapists or anything,) and I have tried to talk to my depression therapist but she told me she doesn't know anything about ED's and is unable to help. I talked to my primary doctor and he suggested I take prozac, because prozac helps with compulsive behaviors. It did not work. I really want help. But I feel like no one is taking me seriously because I am bigger. I have been having bad stomach pains lately, on the lower right side of my stomach and near the top of my stomach as well. And my teeth are suffering badly. Really badly. I am so scared and I just do not know what to do. I dont have the car to drive to a bigger city and I dont know anyone who would be willing to drive me. Is there anything I can do? I have tried to stop purging and I dont even binge half as much. I literally just cannot stand the feeling of even having the littlest of food in my belly. For one, it physically hurts. Not even mentioning the emotional/mental part of it.
I recently moved several states away from home to live with a friend because my home environment was unsafe and not a good place to begin recovery. Things have been going good between us, but I think both of us are getting a little tired of sharing a one bedroom apartment and want more privacy. We've talked about getting a two bedroom apartment, but to do so I need my own job. I haven't been restricting since I came here, but I've been trying to avoid retail, food service, etc jobs. I used to work at a grocery store when I was actively restricting, and at the end of my shift sometimes I seriously thought I'd pass out, and it scared me. I've mostly been applying for office jobs and such that will allow me to remain sedentary for most of the day, but I haven't been having any luck landing one. I think I may have to resort to applying for things like retail or food service if we want to get the new apartment anytime soon, but I'm scared that it will be too much for me physically.Is working physically demanding jobs with an active ED, or when you're just beginning recovery, a safe choice? Could I be further damaging my heart/other organs or worsening my chances of making a recovery if I'm on my feet for 8+ hours a day, doing heavy-ish lifting, running around the store, etc? Is there any way I can arrange to have accommodations made for me? I feel like your average store or restaurant manager is not going to be very understanding or compassionate towards someone who is unwilling to do basic tasks like standing or lifting, but I feel like I don't really have a choice but to apply for those kinds of jobs. I don't have a degree or any specific skills that would land me different jobs.Please note I don't have a medical team overseeing my ED right now, I just haven't been restricting for the past month or so because a lot of the stress I had at home that was causing me to restrict is gone now, I have better access to food in general here, and my friend's been holding me accountable. I don't know if that makes a difference at all, but I thought it might be useful information.Thanks so much for reading!
Recently my GF has been having a lot of difficulties with her eating behaviours. 8 months ago she started getting really into losing weight and running. After 6 months she has reached her goal, but now she is as unhappy or even more than before, this up untill the point that she feels really quilty about eating anything "not healthy" and her overall looks. No matter what I do I cannot seems to break through her barrier of selfesteem. She knows she has a problem but is at lost on what to do. I myself am not sure either, since relating to her problem is near impossible and I cannot just make it a little better by talking. **What other steps I can preform to help my GF so it does not get anyworse?****What sort of support would help her at this point?**Thanks for reading.
I am currently in an adolescent inpatient program for my eating disorder due to low weight and low BMI. I have AN with purging and restrictive subtypes, similar to the two other girls in the unit with me at the moment. My disorder is making me extremely upset at the moment, and I want to be able to recover my weight and make my eating habits normal again without constantly comparing myself to everyone around me and dubbing myself as a faker. I need to be able to recognize I have a problem that is serious and requires help, and I want to be able to think "I'm lucky because I got help before I had serious side effects" instead of "I'm not sick enough, I need to be sicker/skinnier".How do I accept that I have a serious problem and stop comparing myself to the other patients? I feel like a faker, inadequate due to my condition in comparison to the others, like I am not sick enough to be in this position and undeserving of the help I'm receiving.
I'm pretty sure I'm orthorexic and although I've been "in recovery" for 6 months, my weight has still been slightly decreasing. I wanted to take a positive approach to weight gain and browsed subreddits related to nutrition and weight gain, but I feel as if these sites make me think about my weight too much. I know how to gain weight, and I know how to eat healthy, but why can't I commit myself to do it? Why am I so self conscious?To those of you who have recovered, would you recommend browsing subreddits such as these, or would you recommend other communities instead?
I recently started my freshman year of college! I'm 10 hours away from home but I have weelky skype sessions with my therapist and have a team at the local childrens hospital. Mentally and emotionally I am doing great, I am not preoccupied with food, haven't been restricting or purging, have been exercising in moderation, I'm making friends and managing my stress well but I am struggling to keep my weight up. I'm kind of at that point where I don't want to be sick and resent not being able to do what everyone else does. I eat with my friends and eat a normal amount or until I'm full instead of following my meal plan which is so much more than everyone else eats since I'm supposed to gain 10-15 pounds. I tend to lose weight when I'm happy and active because I am not constantly focused on the eating disorder and spending my life planning meals. I'm so glad that I have a life and that recovery isn't all that I am but I want to stay healthy and in school. How can I feel less self conscious and continue living my life while keeping my weight up?
My brain is constantly screaming at me to restrict or to purge. How do you deal with obsessive intrusive thoughts?
I am worried that maybe my friend is relapsing. She has become addicted to fitness and building muscle. She was treated for anorexia a year ago through a hospital program and she doesn't like to talk about it, but believes that she beat it. However, I've read that people struggle with EDs their entire lives and she is under her doctor's recommended goal weight. She has a very popular instagram that seems to be glorifying unhealthy ideals. I've asked her but she doesn't want to talk about it. She wants to be a personal trainer, and I'm having trouble figuring out the difference between health & fitness and obsession & mental illness. My question is is it possible for her to balance fitness and AN?
I am looking for an inpatient treatment center that is like a spa.These two were recommended to me: http://www.sundancecenter.com/ http://sierratucson.crchealth.com/What is your recommendation and why?I tried google and looking at general sites that claim to list all the facilities, but the information is difficult to understand what the facility is really like. There are no aerial pictures and when I use Google maps some of the facilities look like strip malls.Are there any recommendations for inpatient facilities that resemble a spa?
I've been in partial recovery for several years, but over the last 9 months I've actually managed to be purge free, despite binges. I've put on weight, I want to start running again as soon as I can, but my psychiatrist put me on seroquel and it's made me bingey and I keep having cramps in my feet.Today, I failed and purged after a small binge. I was feeling crappy all day, but purging made me feel a lot better and happier for a little while. Then I was desperate for a run. Then I just collapsed in a heap.My eating disorder had been taking a back seat to everything else. But now, it's rearing it's head and I feel overwhelmed. I'm exhausted and I don't want to fight it. I just want to go with it in the hopes that I'll lose weight and finally for the first time in months, something will go right.It's only one purge, should I mention it to my shrink next week?
I have worked with her for about a year now. Over the course of the year, I have taken note of her eating habits. Since our company has frequent luncheons, it has been easier to see what and how much she eats. Not only do her eating habits make it glaringly obvious that there is an issue, it's also her physique. For a while, I tried to ignore the problem & told myself that she was just naturally thin. I am in no way trying to judge her. I honestly only have concern for her.Recently, I have become her assistant. The urgency to approach her (gently, of course) about this since we are in more direct contact each day has become very strong. I have an idea of what I need to do, I'm just hoping for guidance before I talk to her about this. Thank you.
A friend of mine is recovering from minor-moderate anorexia nervosa as well as moderate depression with some self harm (They have seen a general practitioner and will be beginning therapy at some point in the future). They are going on a trip to a foreign country with family and expressed the desire to try to lose as much weight as possible without arousing the suspicion of their family. When I said that that was an abysmal idea (not in exactly those words), they told me that this was 'the first thing [they'd] been excited about in ages' and that this will keep them from cutting. Is it appropriate for me to intervene, and if so, how?How can I voice my concern in a way that is helpful?**Mod note: The OP has requested that you PM /u/avret if you reply.**
I am partially recovered at the moment and I have not starved myself since January and have not purged consistently either. I have noticed some issues with my digestive system and my bowels.My stomach is very weak still. I have thrown up multiple times involuntarily because of how weak it is. Also I now tend to get bloated more easily.Here is the TMI part. I keep getting diarrhea even though I eat lots of fiber with plenty of water. The diarrhea is not that bad but it is still not good. I have been having issues with diarrhea for months and months now.Has anyone had this problem and been able to fix it? Should I go and see a doctor?Mod note: Please see a doctor before taking medical advice 
Found out over the weekend that my little cousin who is 16 was taken to an inpatient eating disorder rehab facility for bulimia. I knew that in years past she had had a problem with binging and purging but was in therapy for other issues and that was being addressed. However, seems recently that it has gotten very bad, coupled with some fiercely aggressive bullying from a select few kids at her school...and so she (willingly) was taken by her family to this ED clinic. Family is about 90 minutes away, but clinic is just down the road from me... hence me wanting to help out.Can anyone give advice on things I could bring her, what she might need, things that helped you if you were IP at a clinic, things you missed. I've read the guidelines for patients at her clinic on what to bring and what not to bring, so I know they can be quite strict, but hoping you all here could provide some personal experiences on what may be most helpful to her. Obviously I will ask her, but she is probably feeling quite vulnerable right now and may not be able to speak up for herself...Thank you guys xoxo
Hi all,I've been struggling with an ED and I am getting treatment from a dietitian and therapist. BED has been an issue of mine since childhood, but in the past year my ED has been leaning towards bulimic/restrictive tendencies, resulting in rapid weight loss. My sister is my best friend and wants to do anything she can to help, but she doesn't really know how. Her best friend is also struggling with an anorexia relapse, and between the two of us, my sister is having a hard time trying to handle it. My parents are pretty involved as well, but they aren't really as open-minded or understanding about ED's, so I've just resorted to setting boundaries and limiting contact. What are some good books, websites, or brochures I can give her? Some of the biggest things that have been an issue with my family are constant comments about my weight loss/body, commentary on what I am and am not eating, and trying to force me to eat more, etc. Any advice, reading materials, or even videos would be much appreciated :)
Been dating my amazing girlfriend for 8 months. She is a wonderful, extremely beautiful and caring person. She is very healthy now but yesterday she opened up to me that she sometimes makes herself purge when she eats something unhealthy. I starting digging in and asking her why she does this and the reason is because she hates what she sees and shes not happy with herself. I knew before we dated about 6 years ago she got very thin, and could not get her period anymore. Her mom forced her to the doctor and she took away her treadmill and she wasn't allowed to see her friends until she got healthy. I thought she was over that horrible part of her life but it seems like she somewhat isn't. She eats very healthy and eats well, and shes in the gym almost daily. Its when she eats chocolate or something sugary that she wants to vomit sometimes. I'm afraid she might be relapsing. I asked her if shes seen a therapist and she said she has few times and she says they just make her angrier because it won't help. I don't want her to have low self-esteem. It hurts to know that someone you care about so much is thinking so negatively of themselves, because she doesn't realize I love her more than her looks, it truly kills me inside because she will never understand how much I love her. I would do anything for this amazing women. She is the love of my life and I would die for her, and i can't understand how a person with that much beauty can feel that way. What can I do to help her or convince her that seeing a therapist is ok? tl;dr: Just found out gf has eating disorder. She says therapists don't help and that it isn't a big deal. What can I do.
Hi guys,Background I've messaged before about thinking I have a problem with food and things have stepped up a bit. I discussed my issues with a GP and a counsellor who described me as having anorexic tendencies but probably not full blown ED - in part because my weight is in the healthy band for my height. I unfortunately had to leave the area due to educational reasons, returning home for the summer (2 months) and will then be moving to finish education for 3 months meaning I'm not really able to build up a long term relationship with a counsellor. Also, because of these short stays there is no way I would get near the top of an NHS waiting list for ED services - the GP who called it anorexic tendencies said it would be around 18 months. New Issue I had an appointment with the hospital for an unrelated issue. He is concerned about the large amount weight I have lost in the past 6 months. He is doing his best to sort out support for me. My parents are in denial. They give weird mixed signals with things they say.  The problem is that I want to stop feeling this horrid about food. I want to mentally get better. I want to eat without guilt. I don't want to gain any weight, since the doctors have said I am a healthy weight. It is the weight loss I've had that they worry about. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Is it possible to recover without gaining weight when you aren't underweight? I'm living in fear of meal plans and forced weigh ins and calorie counting. Help.
I am currently in therapy for Binge eating disorder (which became bulimia) along with depression. There is one FDA approved medication on the market for BED called Vyvanse. It is essentially ritalin. Anyways, my therapist was asking me how much time I spend preoccupied with thoughts of food and my weight, impulse control, etc. I do not have trouble focusing like you would stereotypically imagine with ADD- I did fine in school, but my therapist said ADD and BED are related. For anyone who has taken Vyvanse, have you seen successful results? Is this a better course of treatment for this for those suffering ADD and BED? 
Long story short I got an underage drinking ticket (I'm 20), and I got sentenced with 6 months probation, so no smoking or drinking. Drinking is not so much the issue its the weed. It really helps with increasing my appetite, it's been three days since my sentence and I'm just not eating as much as should... Any ideas to help me through the next few months? How can I make sure I am eating enough when I have little to no appetite?
My (18M) girlfriend (18F) has an extremely toxic home environment. Her mother constantly abuses her (emotionally) and her father is apathetic. Her brother never talks, to anyone.Before we started to date nine months ago, she had three suicide attempts under her belt, and to this day struggles with depression, anger and trust issues, bipolar disorder, BDD, and - as I've realized - anorexia.She is not underweight for her height. I love her so much, and honestly she'd be stunning with or without a different body. But due to her past and her issues, she has very bad self-esteem.She seriously believes she is "fat" and "ugly" - and she definitely is not. Boyfriend bias aside - she is always complimented on her beauty, all the time, everywhere. But to her, none of it matters.I'm going to be honest: I know what to do. Anyone with these kind of issues must want to help themselves, they must receive professional help, and they must have support. But how can I do that for her? I'm at a loss. My loving words and supporting actions go in one ear and out the other. There is, honestly, nobody but me who cares about her and has the authority to do anything about her bad habits. She lashes out on me often, and it is really hurtful, but she always regrets it. I can tell when she's seriously remorseful, and she really doesn't want to be like this.She wants to love herself - which is the issue here.She's going about her recovery all wrong. Neither of us have money for her to go to therapy, and her family don't care enough to involve her healthcare - so she takes matters into her own hands. To love herself, she feels like she has to have an ideal body (nothing wrong with that). She wants to lose weight.To achieve that, she starves herself and over exercises. I've told her this is bad. I've showed her facts, reports, science, everything to prove that I'm not crazy when I tell her that is literally destroying her body, but she doesn't listen.She is restricting to a dangerous point. And just last night, she confessed to me that she purged because she ate more than she usually allows (which was still severely low for a daily intake)What do I do? I love her. I tell her that she's on a slippery slope to disaster. I support her recovery. I care for her. Nobody else does any of this, and even with my support, I can't stop her at all from crumbling into an awful mental (and physical) state. And in just two weeks, she goes off to college, and I follow a week after that. If I can't help her living in the same city, what can I do when we're states apart?tl;dr: Gf is really messed up, and has started restricting/purging. I want to help, but I can't, and I definitely won't be able to when we both go to college. She is too weak to follow through with anything herself. What do I do?
So my two biggest triggers are junk food and my mother. My mother is an abusive asshole which I live with so I can't really avoid her. Also being surrounded by junk food sets of this massive anxiety spike which leads to me wanting to self harm or to binge/purge.How do you cope with triggers in recovery?
How do I sensitively ask someone who's recovering from an ED if they're not relapsing? Should I even ask? If not, is there something else I should ask instead? 
I (17 y.o.) have a (17 y.o.) girlfriend. A few months ago, she told me she has been suffering from binge-eating disorder for the past 3-4 years. Leading to feelings of worthlessness, self-loathing, and issues with self-esteem/self-image (although there are probably some other influencing factors). This has lead to (occasional) self-harming and depressive episodes after she has binged. She has some other issues that complicate her ED, found further down. I am the only person she has told.Her ED has become better since dating me, with her binges being more spread out and infrequent, as I am there to support her, talk to her, and reinforce that she is beautiful. No matter how much affection I show her, she still isn't beating her ED. She needs something more long-lasting. I am leaving the country in a couple of months, and although I will still talk to her, I will no longer be here to give her that complete support. I have talked to her about telling her parents, a close friend, getting professional help, but she is extremely ashamed about it and doesn't really want anyone to know. She hasn't got the greatest parents in the world, but I'm sure that if they knew the extent of her ED they would be there to help. She has one close guy friend that could help her, but I'm unsure of how trustworthy he is. I think she doesn't have faith in a professional to be able to help her (for some reason).I need to know what to do, who to tell. If she says she doesn't want me telling her parents, should I do it anyway? She needs somebody to be there for her, other than me, when I leave.Here is some extra information about her * She has had diabetes since she was a young girl, and her blood sugar levels are always wavering. I'm unsure of the link between her diabetes and her eating disorder. * She is a very, very picky eater. She absolutely loves snack foods and desserts like chocolate, biscuits, etc., and those are the types of food she usually binges on. But, when she wants to eat healthier (or more "normally") she will eat plain chicken, oatmeal, margherita pizza, french fries, and other plain foods. She has begun to experiment a bit more with food, but it's still very limited. This obviously makes it hard for her to eat properly. I really wish she could be less picky, but I don't know how realistic it is to get her to experiment with other, healthier, foods. * She seems to have replaced some meals (such as dinner) with one or two "Quest Bars", solely because they taste like chocolate, or oreos etc. I am unsure of how harmful this is, and how it may be affecting her ED. * She does a lot of exercise, maybe spends 5/6 days a week in the gym when she isn't at school, and 3/4 when she is. I find her body very attractive. She doesn't accept this, or see this and compares herself to models etc. she see's on her social media. * She keeps a daily track of her macro-nutrients (protein, carbs etc.) and is always worrying/obsessing about the values and sometimes won't even go somewhere if she can't find out the macro-nutrients.I still don't believe that she has completely accepted that she actually has an eating disorder.Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
I'm 22. I have had issues with my body image and self-preception- mostly revolving around my weight- since high school. I have gained some weight since high school, even though I still have a mid-range, healthy BMI. I just loathe those extra couple pounds and have begun restricting in order to get them off me. I've put myself on a diet, and while I don't think the amount I'm restricting is medically unhealthy, it's driving me INSANE. I can't stop thinking about calories, food, and my weight. I can't stop craving food. I can't stop hating myself for the extra weight I have. I just want to be able to eat whenever I'm hungry, eat whatever I wish to, eat mindfully, and then stop when I'm full, but I'm afraid if I let go of the calorie-counting, even though it makes me miserable, I might gain weight. That would make me even MORE miserable and I have no idea how I could cope at all with any weight-gain, even a slight amount. This is becoming a serious problem, one that consumes my every thought, and I plan to talk to my therapist about it next Monday. This obsessing is hell. I don't know how I'm going to make it until then. I mean, realistically I know I'm not likely to attempt to harm myself in any way before Monday, but I'm just unbearably stressed out. I've begun resorting to other unhealthy coping mechanisms and I know I'm starting to go to a very bad place again. I just hate everything right now.How can I begin to cope with the idea of weight gain? 
I have had an ED off and on for a very long time but have been able to hide it because I have a curvier body type. Everyone just applauds me when I'm skinny, not realizing that it's usually because I'm eating little to nothing at all. I struggled with disordered eating for years until I met my last boyfriend, who said he loved my curvy (skinnier) body. I got off my disordered diet to enjoy dating him, and we ate out a lot, and cooked a lot, and I inevitably ended up gaining weight. I knew I was heavier but he appeared to still be happy with me. Fast forward five years, he broke up with me because he says he didn't love me anymore. I heard through the grapevine because it was actually because he wasn't attracted to me anymore because I had gotten "fat" since we dated. I've since gone into a tailspin and have been severely restricting my eating. At first I thought it was because I'd lost appetite from some normal break-up related sadness. But it has been weeks. I've been exercising a lot and I still buy food intending to eat it but it just rots in the fridge. I don't want to go down a miserable hole of endless fasting again, but it has always been my way of quickly feeling better when I feel shitty about my weight. And I can feel the pervasive thoughts about how great it would be and how easy it would be to just power through and lose a bunch of weight to make him regret breaking up with me. I have never seen a professional for my ED, but I finally got a therapist to get over this long-term break up. Should mention this to her? She asked if I had any self-destructive behaviors. Is there anything else I can do to mitigate these feelings of worthlessness? I guess I have to accept that I have a curvy/big body type that requires constant maintenance, and not everyone is going to like it. Help. I'm 30. I thought I was over this.How should I bring this up to my therapist? How can I work towards accepting my body? How can I prevent a relapse?
My friend has had an eating disorder for four years, but it only became apparent when she left home (she is an adolescent, and felt the need to leave because she suffers from emotional trauma at home). She has been staying with a friend who was looking after her, but had to be admitted to hospital.The hospital uses the Maudsley method - phase 1 is to ensure she gains weight and physiological health, and mental health issues are not attended to until this phase is complete (as I understand it). Maudsley focusses upon family therapy. I understand it has quite a high rate of success.My question is - is the Maudsley method appropriate for someone who has significant conflict or has significant anxiety regarding their family? Especially where that person suffered some level of abuse, felt the need to run away, and also where both parents are known to have some level of mental health issue themselves? As far as I can understand, these factors make Maudsley a less appropriate option, but I am unsure how to gain further judgement. The hospital that she is admitted to only uses the Maudsley method, so it is not as if she has had a method selected out of multiple options in order to find one that suits her.I raise this as well, because I am of the understanding that this person suffers from some level of PTSD - again, this is only available to me from my personal judgment, but my friend has not had a comprehensive psychological assessment or therapy, so I feel that the hospital staff may not be attending to this part. It is my understanding that such disorders need to be treated simultaneously and not in phase 2 or 3.I guess I'm asking if anyone has been in a similar situation and has any feedback that might help me understand the course that the hospital is recommending and whether or not my personal judgment has any legitimacy, though I understand that it is difficult to determine this from a single reddit post!Any help is appreciated.
This is going to be long but I am feeling alone and scared and completely exhausted. I've been dealing with a variety of eating disorders for 8 years now and I'm finally really breaking down hard.I've always struggled with weight but I never allowed it to really dictate my life as it has since 2007. In 2007, my university went through a very traumatic experience that personally impacted me and my friends. Then in the fall of 2007, I lost my virginity after being raped by a friend in his frat house. After that my self esteem went downhill rapidly and I stopped eating. The majority of the calories through alcohol binges most nights of the week. When I graduated from college, I stopped drinking as much, started over exercising, and continued my very tight food restriction. I went from a healthy weight to severely underweight in about a month. About 3 years later and numerous health problems, I began binging and went from underweight to obese in several months. My depression hit an all time because in my world being fat is the worst thing ever. After a year, I started purging and I lost a huge amount of weight and I now weigh a healthy weight. However I'm on the edge of being overweight which terrifies me and I'm in this terrible binge/purge/restrict cycle. I had really made good progress in recovery but one of my coworkers sexually assaulted me last summer (it's a he said/she said situation) so I still have to work with him and he teases me about last summer. That event through me back into this downward spiral. I met my now bf in 9 months ago and he's the first man that I have ever loved and he loves me. He know the high level of my ED history but doesn't know I still struggle with B/P/R. I work a very stressful job that requires 10+ hour days and the occasional weekend. I'm seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for talk therapy and medication but I still feel out of control. I've racked up almost 10K of credit card debt solely due to BP so my finances are overwhelming despite making a very good salary. I feel like I'm one step away from drowning but I can't seem to stop. BPR makes me feel better so when I'm stressed or upset or whatever, the urge is so overwhelming I often give in. I can't live the life that I want to live with a happy marriage with my bf, children, career success while still dealing with bulimia. What's worse is that I know this is physically in my control. No one is forcing me to BPR but I feel completely out of control. I feel gross and overweight and terrified that I'm wasting my life but I still don't stop. Any advice would be welcome. Should I tell my boyfriend about my continual struggles? (he knows nothing about my debt and previous sexually assaults. I need to get better and I need to recover and I need help)How can I break this cycle?
My sibling lives at home with our parents, one of which is an alcoholic and has been verbally abusive towards my sibling since they were a child, the other is in complete denial about the situation.I have no idea where to even begin with this, it's been on going for at least three years (I had been out of the country) maybe more and I think part of me thought it would just go away, even though I knew deep down it wouldn't. My sibling is very difficult to approach about anything and keeps very much to themselves, and doesn't have any social circle to speak of, and could potentially cut me out completely for trying to talk with them about this. The only time he is with other people is at his job, which he really seems to like and that is a positive. I am so scared for them, they are caught in a cycle of binging an purging. The situation at home is a toxic one, our parents are in a financial mess, I am mid-twenties and self employed just barely getting by but I would give anything to help them. I hope this makes sense, I'm desperate at this point for any advice that anyone can offer. What's the first step in helping my sibling?
Basically, recently, I have had trouble with binging/overeating but I have a history of other ED behaviors. I have always LOVED food and was a pretty tiny kid. Tall, lanky, but loved junk foods. I didn't start thinking of my weight until puberty hit--I didn't gain a significant amount of weight, retrospectively a totally normal amount of weight. It all went to my thighs, guts, and hips (at 16 I was diagnosed with PCOS, which is why I gained there/still hold fat there) and coupled with my newfound fascination with eating disorders, which I guess I learned about through health class/the "media" I began to think about my weight/what I looked like more. I sort of half-assedly attempted to make myself sick, like severely restricting, overexercising, but this would never last. I would always end up binging and then going back to my unhealthy, although quite normal for a preteen girl, eating habits. I never had an eating disorder. Throughout high school I definitely emotionally ate. I was super depressed and didn't have a lot of friends and was sort of an outcast. But I never hardcore binged. I generally ate what I wanted. I was lucky in that I never gained a significant amount of weight. I was never as skinny as I wanted to be (which at this point I've almost completely accepted I'll never be) but was relatively thin.Once I got to college I was really happy. I made friends, people liked me, talked to boys. Did not give a flying fuck about my weight. I gained weight freshman year without really noticing or caring. My weight fluctuated, don't want to go into that much detail because of triggers. Eventually, I went to Paris for a semester and began purging. It was really sporadic and still wouldn't consider myself bulimic. I began self harming that summer and eventually things got so bad I had to leave school. I lost weight because I was so depressed and that's probably where this started because after I was depressed I was so satisfied with the way I looked I wanted to maintain it. Anyway to the present:About four or five months ago I began restricting and rather than binging and then going back to a semi-normal diet, I kept restricting. First by cutting out food groups and then on and on until I had way more not "safe" foods than "safe" foods. I was (and still am) miserable. But I lost weight. And it felt really, really good. People started saying I was tiny, which made me want to lose more. But I became irritable, tired all the time. I kept lashing out at my boyfriend, I stopped going out because I was afraid I would eat. I began purging if I ate anything unsafe. Sometimes, not often, I would buy unsafe food just to purge it. Recently, I had to leave my apartment and move home, because of this and also because I stopped taking my meds (I am diagnosed bipolar ii + OCD). Once I got home, I ate whatever I wanted. I was SO HUNGRY once I stopped restricting. I ate everything possible. I craved dairy, meat, bread, everything I hadn't eaten. I ate and ate and ate. And gained. And felt so disgusted with myself. So restricted again. And then binged again. Finally, I told myself I am going to get better. I am going to eat healthy, but an adequate amount. I am going to run, which I've been doing (and, not surprisingly, when I actually eat enough, I have enough energy to run!).But now that I've fucked up my brain/body I have NO idea how to eat anymore. I don't know when I'm hungry, or when I'm full. I don't know HOW to eat.So I am curious how you guys got out of this cycle, if you guys have a certain food lifestyle that has helped, if any of you have PCOS and have found a way to maintain healthy and balanced? And how to stop obsessing about food? Whether I am empty or stuffed I am ALWAYS thinking about food and am so tired of it. I can't enjoy anything anymore.If there is any advice you have to spare, I would love it. I have been in therapy for years and I talked to my psych about going to an OP program which she didn't think was necessary, although she recommended a nutritionist which I am looking into.
I'm in the normal/healthy weight range. I was an extremely chubby kid when I was younger and obviously dealt with some rude remarks from peers and family. However, even eating a large and unhealthy meal or munching on a crap-load of junk food, I'll feel extremely guilty of myself. I know that I won't suddenly gain weight from this one meal , but I can't shed myself of this mentality. My guilt might seem quite harmless at first but then all I do is think about the meal that I shouldn't have had for hours or even days. Like, if I hadn't eaten that meal maybe I'll be a few pounds lighter right now or if I hadn't eaten that snack my face will be slimmer right now. How can I eat without feeling guilt after eating a larger meal?
 My girlfriend has AN and she is losing weight from not eating, going to the gym and purging. I'm 18 and she's 17 now and and has had it on and off since 14 or so and her parents were extremely unsupportive when it first came around. They brought her to dietricians only to not listen to the professional and their nutrition plan because they felt that it was not enough so they kept trying to stuff her with food. They threatened her that if she kept losing weight or if they caught her purging that they'd kick her out and send her back to her home country. They think it's some kind of teenage attitude problem as opposed to an actual illness and it  upsets me greatly. The parents and her grandma all call her names and tell her she's manipulative, ungrateful and asks why she can't be normal.They gradually just kind of forgot about it and let her on her own. Once we got together, I started to talk to her about it and since then we've met the school counsellor, but not much has happened as it's only 20-40 minutes each week. I'm always there with her and even then she leaves things out. Like, after I eat at a takeaway or whatever and she's there with me (not eating) and we go to her place, her parents ask if she ate and she answers that we ate at takeaways even though it was only me. I've found bread and other food items stuffed in drawers in her room which were given to her by her mum to eat but instead she just hides it. I've asked her to ask her parents to look for a person to talk to, but they never did so I found one myself and paid 300 dollars for an hour and she absolutely hated it. The person just went off and said that she's killing herself, she needs to be hospitalized etc just started really roughly and my girlfriend couldn't handle it so we crossed that off. My gf is in her home country now with her family and they went to a person there together only to be told the same thing they heard last time and it ended with the mum crying and the father shouting and getting angry at her. It's taking it's toll on her. She gets frequent stomach aches, punches her stomach when she's frustrated or feels 'disgusting' and I've notice scratch marks on her legs and arms. I'm really worried. I read that dealing with AN is difficult and requires a lot of support from the family to overcome but I don't think any exists here. Sorry I couldn't keep this short and it being all over the place, I had to get this out there. She made me promise not to tell anyone I know so it's been sitting with me.How can I help her? What should my next step be when her parents are unsupportive?edit: Post by /u/feladirr
im 17 and i have major body issues. ive found myself eating less and less. i love food but i feel so guilty when i eat a lot of it. i usually don't have breakfast. and it's because i think im fat, ugly, i don't see myself as beautiful. i found out about BDD and started reading about it. i read people will constantly look in mirrors and spend so much time fixing their hair and makeup. they try to avoid pool parties. this sounds like me. i hate wearing tank tops because i think it makes me look fatter. im always wearing sweaters, or slightly baggy clothing. and im so cold all the time. recently i weighed myself and i can remember feeling so much guilt because i had been eating more and more with friends and family. it really impacted me. i felt like i had failed myself. i constantly think about losing weight, my makeup, my hair, clothes, etc. but i haven't gone to a doctor to see if i have BDD. i don't know how to approach my mom about this. i like to think i can get over it but it's really starting to damage my mental health.im asking for advice because ive never talked about my body issues with others and it's not helping.do I fit BDD? what should I do if I do?
Hey, I seriously struggle with this and don't even know where to start. I constantly feel embarrassed going out with my friends and not being able to order off the menu. If I could conquer this, i would lead such a more enjoyable life. Whats the first step in getting this fixed?
I've struggled with disordered eating off and on for over 10 years. Over that time I've gone through separate periods of solely restricting, then solely binging & then binging and purging. I was discharged from a partial hospitalization center 2 years ago and thought I was in the clear. I struggled occasionally throughout that time but am now back to binging on a regular basis. I've gained weight and feel terrible about myself. The only thing that numbs this pain of hating my body is food. It's not yet to the point where food is ALL that I think about but I do think about it quite a bit & always eat food if I'm offered it even when I'm not hungry. I can't keep any food that I like at my house because I will eat it ALL when no one is around.I know therapy is a very important part of my recovery, but I can't afford it. I'm so mortified of my weight gain & behaviors that I can't talk about it to anyone, so I thought I'd start here for some support.How can I help myself?Any advice/encouragement would be helpful. Thank you!
I was in treatment for anorexia in high school. After treatment, I still struggled with disordered eating and thoughts through college. I was finally doing better; for about 5 years, I was eating normally, often in excess. I gained a significant amount of weight, and currently am overweight.Dieting has always been hard, because I find that when I try to log calories, I instantly fall into the rigid, controlling methods that led me to anorexia in the first place. I was doing OK this time. I was logging calories without being crazy. Then I skipped a meal.Then I skipped a meal a few days in a row. I just binged and purged for the third time this week, and I looked at myself in the mirror and realized that I need to get a handle on this before I spin out. I feel so much shame telling my family and friends that I'm in this situation. I'm living alone, in a city where I don't know anyone, and I don't know how to get support here without telling the people I love and, inevitably, letting them down.  I need to accept that I've relapsed. What are my next steps?
First of all, I wanted to say that this subreddit is very helpful and it's been a wonderful resource to me in helping my girlfriend with her eating disorder. My girlfriend is 19 and she has a combination of anorexia and bulimia that tend to cycle between each other (sometimes she goes through periods of restriction and then she will have periods of binging and purging)I have been helping her deal with her disorder for more than a year now and there's one thing I've had the most struggles dealing with. How am I supposed to react when she tells me about her plans of restricting? Every once in a while she will show me some diet plan she found on the internet that suggests restricting to crazy levels. When she talks to me about it, she acts very happy and excited about her new "diet". What things should I say to her when she does this? I typically try to say that her choice of eating habits are hurting her but she only says "no I need to do this to be thin" or "I don't care I have to do this". I haven't been able to find a way to talk about this with her without making her angry or anxious. Anything I say seems to hurt more than help. I love her more than anything else in the world and I can't bear to see her do this to her body. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!
I'm home for the summer right now, but when I'm living with my roommates most of the year, the one girl's comments about food really upset me. I'm a healthy weight. I am mostly recovered from my eating disorder (bulimia. started recovery about 1.5 years ago...), but I still get into overeat/restrict cycles. I know I eat too much when I'm stressed; it is something I am trying to work on. It's not binging per se, just eating large-ish meals. When I was in treatment, they told me a meal this size was a "normal" meal, but I'm still not sure I believe them.Anyways, even when I'm not eating "a lot", my roommate makes comments about what I'm eating a lot and it makes me so upset. She'll say "omg, don't eat x, it's so bad for you!". More often, if I go to make lunch or something, she'll ask me if I'm actually hungry. If I order something at a restaurant and I'm thinking I might finish it, she'll make a comment to encourage me not to finish.Even writing this puts me on the verge of tears. She does not have an ED/MH issues herself (we've openly talked about this before. She feels like she can't understand the MH issues so many of her friends have because she has never experienced a mental illness). She knows about my ED-history now, but hasn't for most of the time we've known each other, and finding out didn't change anything.I don't know how to cope. I don't want to say anything to her because she sees mental illnesses as "weaknesses" and thinks people can just "get over" them if they choose to. Like it's easy.How do I deal?
The last several years I have had trouble with eating throughout the day. I averagely went to bed around 4am and got up around 2pm, and typically only ate later in the day.Right now I go to bed around 8am and if I have nothing to do that day, I get up at 5pm. I eat everything (not overeating, tho) starting at 2am and ending when I go to bed. I know why, it's a mental thing. I am scared of getting hungry throughout the day, so I just push everything I eat later and later. The later I get up, the less time I have to go without eating until night and I can eat. Also, when I know I am about to eat, or have food with me, it's all I can think about. I have separated food and my life. It's subconscious, I don't literally think these things to myself, but I have thought and reflected a lot and this is what I've come to. I really want to change. But I am soo scared of moving it up. Every night when I tell myself, 'tonight's the night, just 30 min' I just can't. Or i move up my first meal and wait an extra 30 min for the next.Please help me, I hate this lifestyle now, I want to eat breakfast, and go out to lunch, and naturally get up early and go to bed at night.
Apologies in advance for the length of this post. I'm looking for some thoughts or advice, if possible. First up a few details about me - I'm 29, and I'm a trans woman. I've never been anything other than quite thin, but a few years ago I began to get really self-conscious about my size. This was before I was able to get on HRT and I had some pretty major issues with my body (most of which are slowly resolving themselves after nearly 2 years of HRT).Most relevantly I hated where weight went on my waist and my belly and made me feel bulky and so, so masculine, and it killed me inside. So I always kept myself fairly thin, but never such that it was a problem. Eventually I started cutting right down on what I was eating to try and be thinner. For a while I kept a spreadsheet to keep track of what calories I was taking in and always aimed to have as few as possible. I liked the sense of control over my body it gave me after feeling for years like it betrayed me. I'd never had that before.So I eventually got to a point where for months - more than 2 years, if I'm being honest - I was barely eating. I'd go days without a proper meal. I'd be happy about losing weight and want to be even thinner and convinced myself that this was totally normal. I was always hungry but I just ignored it. People would comment on how thin I was, and my family would always be trying to push food on me. I'd say I ate loads and I didn't know why I was losing weight and I think I believed it, I just didn't let myself consider that other people had a very different relationship with food. Looking at photos of me from then I look so unhealthy.I realised a few months ago that I was seriously underweight, and I've been trying to work on raising it back up. I still sometimes feel ill at the thought of food, so I'll ignore the hunger and not eat. I know that I should eat more and I'm forcing myself to and I'm trying to. There are days occasionally when I barely eat anything and other days when I'll really push myself and I'll do really well - and I am slowly putting weight on, even if I'm still underweight - but it's far harder work than I think it should be or seems to be for other people, and I'm beginning to realise I might have some variety of eating disorder. If anyone has any thoughts or advice or any idea where to go next with this then it would be so very much appreciated. I want to put weight on and get back to being healthy again but I really think my relationship with food and eating is holding me back and I don't want it to any more.
It has come to my attention that I seriously need help. I started binge eating in 2011, when I was in an emotionally and physically abusive boyfriend. He limited my calories and told me what I could and couldn't eat. We were in this relationship for about 3 years until I broke it off. I still continued to binge eat when I was stressed, but I have become aware of how frequent it has become.I currently live at home with my parents, and when I'm home I'll binge a lot within a span of 10-30 minutes and I feel absolutely disgusted with myself afterwards. After I binge, I purge. I know this is so unhealthy and I hate myself for doing it.My parents don't know that I do this and I am so scared to ask them for help. I want help, and I need help. I don't know where to start. What do I do? How do you stop binge eating? How do you stop purging? How do I stop self-harming myself? I need help.Thank you guys.
I've come home for the summer from college and I'm really concerned about my sister. She has a history of eating and body image issues - I'm not sure exactly what as she is quite secretive about it but she's started opening up a little more about it recently and I believe she used to have orthorexia which has now morphed into anorexia, or something like that. She went to college this September but had to come home at Christmas because she couldn't cope, she got extremely ill and underweight and developed anxiety. She's doing a bit better now and has regained a little weight but I'm still really worried about her.She eats regular meals but a lot of the meals are very restricted - she is clearly not getting the calories or nutrition she needs. What concerns me more is her behaviour: I've been home less than 2 weeks and she's already had at least 3 meltdowns (maybe more but I've lost count) when she hasn't been able to go food shopping on time, when her exercise time was delayed by 5 minutes, when her cooking time was delayed by 5 minutes... really little things that she doesn't seem to be able to cope with at all and just breaks down into hysterical crying and wailing. These incidents seem to revolve mainly around her scheduling of food and exercise related activities and she gets upset when her schedule is disrupted.She is a really difficult person to live with (negative, rude, tries to control everyone according to her schedule, these hysterical crying fits over tiny things, she is sensitive and very easily offended.... she has a difficult personality, and has treated my mom like crap for years), part of which is due to her illness but partly it's just her personality. Even so, she's still my sister and I care about her. but I have no idea how to help her when she won't accept help. She won't take any criticism or advice and she has refused to even consider seeing a therapist. She's 19 so our parents can't force her to go.Can anyone give me some advice? I'm only home for holidays so seeing her behave like this has shocked me. I'm also not at home for much longer before I leave again so I am especially at a loss. How can I help her?
Ive currently been with my girlfriend for 6 months, and i love her so so much. I care for her so deeply, and i can tell we'll be together forever. She's struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, self-harm and body image issues in the past, and she has since stayed nearly 2 months clean of self harm, but still gets recurring bad thoughts. She basically will call herself 'fat' all the time, and point out all of her own 'flaws' in her body and bring herself down, and she refuses to eat much when we're out. She's told me that she hates eating, and that her mum wont let her leave the house until she's had breakfast, after which she claims she is full. She is kinda obsessive about food as well, as in she talks about it quite a lot. After shes eaten lots of food in one day, she feels bad and she always says bad things about herself and her body. she always talks abut how she works out, and she told me she avoids hunger cues. She's mentioned things about purging after meals, but this as a long time ago, but its still very likely that she does it. My question is what do i do? How do i support her. I tell her daily that i love her and i wouldnt change her for the world, and thats shes beautiful, but she just goes on about how 'ugly' and 'fat' she is. It does upset me a lot when she says the things she does about herself, and it does frustrate me when she wont eat, but i tend to hide these emotions from her otherwise she'll get upset, which gets to me as well i guess... i just feel so useless. I just dont know what to do... i feel like its my responsibility to get her on her feet again, but i know it isnt. She refuses help of all kind. Believe me, all her friends, family and myself have strongly persuaded her to get help, but she wont. She's still under 18, so her mum is taking her to see a psychiatrist about her problems, but a referral From a doctor hasnt been made yet. And no, breaking up with her is not an option.
My doctor told me that reintroducing empty calories will improve my relationship with food and help me get to a healthy weight. I'm currently eating more, as requested, but I still over-analyze the process of eating these "fear foods." I'm making waaay too big of a deal about it. I make such a big deal about it that I fear my relationship with food is still damaged. Is there any way to make eating feel casual again? My goal is to get to a state of sensible indulgences, but I fear I've forgotten how to do it on my own.
To give a bit of background we've been together for about 4 years and have been living together for almost 3. We're both almost 22 years old and about to finish university. We live together in a flat (roommate situation? for you americans) with a 3 other guys and as a flat we're all pretty close - almost like family you could say.She's been struggling with BN on and off since she was about 14 I think. The severity comes and goes, and for the 1 and a half years she's been doing really well and keeping everything under control. However, she's just started her Masters degree and the stress of it all has really taken a toll on her mental health.She is adopted and by all means to an outsider her situation is as perfect as anyone could hope for. Her birth parents were too young to keep her, hence the adoption. Her adoptive parents (I'll refer to them as her parents) are great! Very supportive and loving family. Its only the 3 of them in the immediate family, but their extended family is also very close and supportive. Her relationship with her birth parents is fine - they come from a different walk of life so understandably there can be some frustrations with everyone not seeing eye-to-eye, but its nothing extreme or unhealthy. Thats a bit off topic, but I'm sure her adoption is what ultimately caused (?) her ED. Also she has 2 younger birth sisters about 10 years younger.I'm really sorry for the long wall of text - theres a lot of factors that go into this.She's mentioned before that the pressure to fit in with such a "perfect" family is constantly looming, and having a family full of fit and healthy people (while her birth mother is probably an unhealthy weight) puts a lot of pressure on her to stay thin.Thats pretty much all of the background I think. Now on to more recent things.She hovers around the unhealthy/healthy BMI (as do I - naturally).She is quite short.She is very active - intense sport 3 - 4 times a week.We eat healthily. She is a great cook (and loves it). No junk food.Masters degree has caused her B/P behaviour to start againHer parents are now more involved - they knew earlier, but everything was under control back thenShe (we) has just started a bit of counselling (half because she wants to/half because we want her to)I can see its helping her cope with the stress of it.Its getting worse.Our flatting situation can be a bit toxic at times for someone with an ED ("Females should be thin!", "She's too fat!" behaviour). It was never extreme, no one genuinely has those views but the jokes still understandable hurt. To counter this, we agreed to talk to the main culprit (nice guy, very understanding), and he has stopped. He shared that he has had family go through the same thing. Because of this, he and my SO started talking to help her cope. Ultimately this made everything a lot worse. He's not the most positive person and has troubles of his own (unrelated) and I fear his outlook may have reinforced in my SO that life is bleak etc.Ultimately, she is very intelligent. I tell her she is beautiful, and that I don't mind if she puts no some weight. I try to point out that because of her lifestyle she will never be overweight and its not really something she needs to worry about. On a logical level she knows all of this, but that is of course why this is a disorder - her behaviour is illogical. She knows the damage she is doing to herself, and she knows how much a normal person should eat but that doesn't help her BN.I just don't understand why.I understand that it isn't a choice for her, in the sense that she chooses to binge and purge. I understand she can't just stop her feelings. I understand that by eating little, sleeping little this makes her mentally unhealthy and fuels the fire of BN, and I understand that it is a cycle.I don't know what to do anymore. What can I do to help? I've tried sitting back and letting her come to me for help. I've tried being a bit more forceful on the off chance it might be a bit of a phase (I hate saying phase, because its not the right word, but I think you understand what I mean). And now I'm trying to take a bit more control of her eating habits which she has been quite receptive to.She respects me a lot and we have a healthy relationship, so I told her I will be around her when she eats. We will (try) keep meal times to breakfast, lunch, possible afternoon re-fuel), and dinner. She can eat what she likes and I will step in if I think its too much/becoming a binge.I'm hoping some of you who may have gone through this, or experience ED from any angle might be able to help me, help us.I really appreciate any input. How can I help my SO?
I am about 12 weeks, nearly 13, pregnant with my second child. Through my first I did not suffer from any eating disorder. I have been extremely sick and I am on medication for my morning sickness, and as a result I have dropped an unhealthy amount of weight.My biggest problem right now, is worrying about the future. I'm eating whatever I can, when I can to try to put on weight and get nutrients to my baby. My ed doesn't seem to be affecting me much. I'm worried about after the baby is born. Will seeing my new body make me freak out and throw me right back into restricting and purging? How can I combat this and ready myself for the changes I am going to face?

I am a master's candidate at Northwestern University/Medill finishing up my degree in longform health reporting. For my final story, I would like to write a piece that profiles someone who has struggled with orthorexia. I think the condition deserves much more attention and I would like to profile someone because I think a more personal story will resonate more with readers. I would love to speak with someone about their experience with orthorexia who is either in the Chicagoland area or in the Midwest in general, as I can travel. Thank you.
I have been bulimic for over 10 years but I have decided I cannot do it anymore. I want to stop, however, I am extremely fearful of gaining weight when I stop purging. I am working extremely hard on limiting myself from binge eating. I have gone 4 days without throwing up and have kept my calorie intake relatively normal. Even in those 4 days, I feel like I have gained a lot of weight and it's terrifying me. Is my metabolism permanently destroyed? What can I expect my body to go through when I stop being bulimic?
I have had BED since I was a child and have struggled with my weight since I was 11 years old (currently 19F). I am sick of feeling ashamed in my own body and don't know what to do to further recover. Every time I try to lose weight it turns into a miserable failure of binging and ultimately hating the gym. However when I just try to stick to my recovery I feel like I am never making any progress. My therapist always said that if I focus on my recovery, eating to my hunger, and healthy body image, then the extra weight i have will come off naturally overtime. I can't help but be worried that my weight is going to keep going up and that I will ultimately be in a place I cannot recover from. This year I gained some pounds from being really stressed at college, going on birth control, and a failed relationship. This weight gain has pushed me into a more unhealthy range and has made me seriously consider changes I need to make. Should I try to diet, which has always led to failure?Should I listen to my therapist?Please help reddit!! TL;DR : have BED, weight keeps going up over the years despite recovery efforts and therapy, should I actively try to lose weight or focus on healthy body image and let the rest happen on its own?
Talking to her (she's 20, just as reference) about it just makes it worse. She ends up binging after being confronted, or after having been to therapy. We (family) have tried bringing it up a number of ways, just letting her know we're there and offering support if she wants it, but the mere mention of food basically makes her binge eat for days.We recently got her to realize she has a problem and she started going to therapy, but it's been making her worse. She gets home and binge eats way more than usual.She is young and packing on the pounds and it's really worrying, what can we do to help her? She does want help but I don't understand this situation at all. We're worried about both her mental wellbeing and her physical health.
I've lived the last 6 years with what I would consider 'disordered eating', very obsessed with my body, purging, restrictive calories, incredibly intense exercise. However in the last month I have developed what I can only consider a serious case of BED.I can't go three days without a moderate to serious binge and have put on enough weigh to make me want to not leave the house. I feel suicidal, I'm trapped. I can't afford to see a therapist but I feel like this is destroying my life.How can I recover without therapy?
I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder last summer (but through therapy I learned that it probably started about a decade ago). I'm significantly overweight, and sometimes it's still difficult for me to "accept" that I have an eating disorder because of my weight.Logically, I know that fat people can have eating disorders. But there's this hurtful idea in society that eating disorders only happen to thin people, or they make people thin. It just makes me feel like an outsider among people who have EDs, and like I'd be lying if I said "I have an eating disorder."Having an eating disorder and being obese feels like a contradiction, and I'm not sure how to reconcile it. How do you deal with doctors? How do you deal with friends and family and explain the problem?
I grew up outside the US and was getting antidepressants from my parents outside of the US, last year in November I dropped the medication because I wasn't seeing a therapist and felt that I didn't need them anymore.With medication my bingeing episodes where occasional and not as severe but now I have been having them very often to the point that i've gained weight, my clothes don't fit me anymore, not even my work out clothes, and I can't afford to just change my wardrobe.I have been seeing a therapist once a week but I keep on bingeing and gaining weight.After doing research I feel like I can benefit fro Vyvanse while I get back to my regular weight but as not being grown in the US I do not know **which insurance would be good to get and what kind of doctor should I see?** I live in Texas if that matters.I understand eating disorders don't go away overnight but the weight gain has made me feel so depressed that I have contemplated *suicide* (not that I even want to die but it is a recurrent thought that I can't avoid). I honestly just want to disappear until I go back to who i was 6 months ago. I feel trapped and lost. Any suggestions?
I feel like I ate too much yesterday, ended up coming home and feeling very bloated, and overweight. Kept looking at myself in the mirror and grimacing and picking apart my looks.Generally on Thursday mornings I wake up early and exercise, but this morning when my alarm went off, I just...didn't get out of bed...and then the second alarm went off and I just...stayed there...Now I'm sitting on Reddit, trying to tell myself I should get my homework done but I keep getting distracted by watching episodes of Seinfeld on Hulu.And the overpowering thought in my head is about how much of a loser I am for not getting up and just doing some quick exercise. For eating too much last night. For worrying too much about food. For worrying too much about the clothes I wear and if they're going to make me feel fat or look fat or not.I'm feeling very depressed and upset with myself. It's hard to keep going like this.How do I deal with these issues? How can I relax about my looks? How can I learn to accept myself as I am?
I've really been struggling with my eating lately and it's starting to dominate my life, thoughts, and actions again, though in a different way than before. I'll explain and I hope you can give advice for overcoming this binging cycle.I have a history of restrictive eating. I was hospitalized. I did inpatient. *As a man who's never been underweight, my anorexia has never felt "real" to me.* I try to distance myself from it when possible, as it's been a source of shame to me. I got better enough to live and feel normal but I never fully recovered all of my physical and mental normalities. *This shame really has me in its grip lately.* Eating around other people, especially if I'm eating more than them, causes me shame. Eating outside of my routine causes shame. I can't feel normal when eating. That being said, lately I've been eating more and eating what I think is enough for me.*However, nighttime binging for me has run wild in the last few weeks.* I'm devouring everything in sight almost every night as soon as everybody goes to sleep. I've binged before in my recovery out of hunger, and I know what it feels like: I get ravenous, I lose control, I just need to satisfy the empty feeling in my stomach. The binges lately have felt different. I'm more in control and I don't feel as hungry. *With past binges I've wanted to stop and I couldn't. Now, I want to keep going.* I think a lot of this has to do with the shame I mentioned earlier: around others, I'm afraid to eat a lot and am very particular about food. Now, alone and away from judgment, I can eat whatever I want. I also get emotional satisfaction from this nighttime eating. I have no friends or job, as I'm home for the summer from college. I have an emotional void that night eating fills. It gives me something to get through each day.I'm finally realizing that these binges might not be triggered by hunger and this terrifies me. I don't want to go from one end of the spectrum to the other. I'm lost and just hope somebody out there can give me some guidance or wisdom.How can I reduce the obsessive thoughts around eating?How can I stop the binging at night cycle?How can I learn to deal with the shame around eating in front of others?
I am currently trying to recover from AN without a treatment team, just my mum. I am still counting what I'm eating with an app, although not restricting, but I really just want to be able to eat without my phone, but even the thought of not knowing gives me major anxiety and I'm scared of loosing the control. How can I ween myself off counting or to just stop cold turkey? How can I deal with the loss of control?
My girlfriend is recovering from ABN for about a year now. She has been extremely slow in increasing her calories and actually started eating less after she started getting help, although the purging stopped immediately. She is now eating approximately what a normal-weight woman would require to maintain her weight, sometimes less, but exercises quite a bit. She browses Pinterest for exercise pictures, along the lines of "get you summer 6 pack in 30 days" "exercise to slim your legs" and then below the headline is a series of exercise routines. The text is usually accompanied by a picture of an athletic female.My issue is, while having an athletic body is not a bad thing, I can't articulate why constantly browsing these sorts of things is bad for her and hindering her recovery. She almost misinterpreted something I said so she thought I was implying she didn't have a nice body and she shouldn't be trying to achieve these picture perfect bodies, but luckily I managed to nip that thought before it fully formed. Can anybody tell me if actually browsing these images and fitness plans is damaging? How can I articulate this to her without upsetting her? I know that exercise is a form of purging, but the exercise she does now is a healthy amount for any regular female of her age and I am focusing on trying to encourage her to eat more to enable her to exercise without feeling exhausted.
Hey, I'm hoping to give a speech about people afflicted by anorexia, or maybe eating disorders in general, in my communications class. The point of the speech is to refute common misconceptions that might hurt the anorexic community; like generalizations, assumptions, or myths.I've done a bit of research around the internet but I think it would be a lot better if I got some actual opinions from people with first hand experience or common knowledge from the ED subreddit.Anyways, what do you think are some common misconceptions about people with eating disorders?Thanks in advance.
I have a friend who I believe has been purging at some BBQs I've hosted. I'm friends with both her and her husband. I want to be supportive and avoid things that maybe triggering for her. I'm unsure if I should say anything. I'm thinking I should not as it is not my place. Should I perhaps talk to her husband? I assume he knows. It would be to let them know I'm aware. I do not want to "fix" her, I just want to provide a non-triggering comfortable environment.How can I help her?
I just really need someone to talk to. As of <24hrs ago I'm new to reddit,Since about 17 I've been overeating and throwing up after I eat, like a bulimic but I've been too chickensh*it to confront it. Breaking up with my bf, I've had experiences likened to a panic attack but not diagnosed because I'm too afraid/broke to see a real doctor. Now as a 22 year old I've been to a shrink once this past semester and never gone back. What do I do? My boss, (now ex)boyfriend and friends have told me to go back to a shrink. I feel so alone and don't have time for a shrink or s.o to "rescue me". Should I follow their advice to see a shrink? Is there something else I should do? 
Is tracking calories a healthy thing for those in recovery? Does it depend on the person, or is there a general consensus from the nutrition field on the best way to detach from disordered habits?
I was one of the people in the study testing Vyvanse as a treatment for binge eating. Being part of that study also helped me realize I had ADD, and once the study was done I went through testing for ADD so I could get the Vyvanse prescribed to me that way. I stopped taking it for several years when I decided to try to have kids, but I am back on it now. I have been doing wonderfully for the past five months, but now I am starting to see myself leaning towards anorexic behavior and it is frightening.For anyone else who had this happen, what did you do to help yourself from going down that road? I don't want to go off it and start binging again, but I cannot bring myself to eat enough anymore.
My girlfriend has dealt with binging and restricting for nearly 20 years. She experiences the feelings of being overwhelmed about things I have come to consider 'normal parts of being an adult.' Most recently, she graduated from a clinic for others suffering similar issues. She struggles with her body image and has the most severe shame-spiral reactions I've ever seen in a person. I'd like to be able to have conversations about the hard stuff, and I'm okay if I have to ease into them, but I know that if I ignore the conversations for her benefit, I will grow resentful of not being able to share my feelngs.We practice "I" statements, such as "I feel," or "I worry when." I ask her if she wants me to listen or solve first, so that I can provide the most helpful attention. We go to couple's counseling to have smarter people than us point out things.It's been a few months since this situation was revealed, and I'm feeling like I'm losing my mind because she's still lying about little things and it is causing me a lot of distress - I don't want to go home and see her; I'd rather forget about her when I'm away. It's very frustrating.**What are some methods I can use to approach her without triggering her, or tripping the shame-threshold of no return?****How can I support her without sacrificing my own wellbeing and happiness?**
Hi guys. I need some help figuring out what's going on with me and how I can get help. I've been struggling with my weight almost my whole life, beginning since about 3 or 4 where I remember my family always making comments about my weight. It started with comments like "you need to lose weight so boys will like you," and "you'll be pretty when you lose weight." At the time I was a good swimmer, so my parents would make comments like "to swim better you need to lose x amount of kg."I grew up with the message in my head that said "you're too fat, you need to lose weight, you'll only be beautiful and worthy if you lost weight and were thin." When I was younger, I would try to restrict what I ate, then ended up binging on everything I wasn't allowed to eat (but was in the house, anyway). It was like my parents gave me the order to lose weight, but at such a young age I had no idea how, and I snapped under the pressure.My first successful attempt at weight loss was on exchange in Japan where I restricted and exercised excessively. I lost an unhealthy amount of weight in one month. Nobody said anything because I was losing weight.I came back to my home country and put on double the amount of weight, and it has just been rising ever since. I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of diet - binge- fail -diet - binge - fail that I can't get out of, and the only result is that I just keep getting bigger and bigger.Few years later, I've moved to Europe and I live on my own in a student room. My relationship with eating is out of whack. I was on a popular diet for six months and lost weight, but then I cracked and ate everything I could find, gaining the weight back. I share a kitchen with a big building and I sometimes just order take out or eat in secret if there are people in the kitchen, because I'm so ashamed of being seen eating. I buy a lot of food I refused to eat on the diet, and just binge on them in my room. It's much worse in times of stress, for example I have exams now, and I'm going back to my country for the summer - I'm scared that people will see that I'm still fat.All I want is to be a normal weight. I want to stop gaining weight, I want to stop feeling so ashamed about eating food, I want to stop binging. I'm in DBT for Borderline PD and I think because I stopped doing other self harming methods, my eating has gotten much worse. However, when I tell my mentor about these feelings, they just get ignored.tl;dr: **I think i have compulsive eating or binge eating disorder, and I want to know what I can do to get better. How do I bring this up to my mentor and get appropriate help?**
I know two people who always go to the toilet straight after they eat, even if it's very little proportions. They have both made comments about their weight in the past, despite both of them being very skinny. They do tend to portion control to a large degree. I understand it could be a fast metabolism but do you think in any other situation, they could be trying to lose weight or have something that borders on a eating disorder? Is there something I should do or say?
Hello, So last summer my older sister ( mid 20s, F) had a painful bone surgery to correct an old injury. As a result, she was couch ridden and nauseous from painkillers for months. This caused her weight to plummet dramatically since she had no appetite and any food she had to eat made her feel sicker. She’s average height and went from a healthy weight to very underweight in 3 months. All her bones protrude in an unhealthy way. She has always had a naturally “thin” body shape but hated her some parts of it before. She now likes being underweight. She was convinced to go to a nutritionist who wanted her immediately hospitalized. But my sister is smart and knows how to manipulate people, and she swore she would stick to a prescribed eating regime. She is stuck at home with my parents, however, and they tell me she has not followed the doctor’s advice to eat multiple small but healthful meals throughout the day. She only eats a few select foods, and although healthy, she's not eating enough to look or feel healthy.When my parents call her out on not eating enough, she lashes out. When I was home for the holidays, I was shocked at her skeletal appearance. She has literally wasted away to nothing. I struggled with eating issues a few years back, and told her that the stomach pains and loss of your period are not worth looking skinny. I told her I was terrified that her heart will give out if she doesn’t get healthy, and she told me to shut up. She has been to a few doctors, who tell her that she is severely underweight but since none have said she’s in imminent danger of death she thinks she’s “healthy”. My parents are at a loss as to what to do, and I’m 1000 miles away. To worsen the situation, she has recently been getting into modeling. Modeling has always been one of her dreams, and now she has the emaciated look that the media portrays and it is terrifying in person. She just had her first photo shoot, and I don’t even recognize her in the photos. I expressed my concern for getting into modeling when her health and body image are already fragile, and she insists she’s fine.She overexercises.  I think her exercise regime is hurting her even more. Her body is probably eating itself.The main problem is that she likes the way she looks now. When she posts photos on social media, her girlfriends make supportive comments. She has bought a new wardrobe of smaller clothes. Luckily I’m not alone in concern for her, since some of her friends have messaged me privately saying they’re worried about how skinny she looks, and I tell them to tell her that instead of me.TL;DR: I don’t know how to help my sister when she likes how emaciated she is and is getting modeling jobs for her new body shape. I don’t want to lose my sister. How can I help her see that she is killing herself?Thank you for reading.

Hi Redditors,Just wanted to relate what I'm going through and see if anyone has some words of wisdom. I currently fall into more of the ED-NOS category and I've found it really hard to find information/resources on the internet to help me understand what is happening.Long story short, I struggled with anorexia in my early teens, and recovered fairly well throughout high school. When I went off to college, though, my moderate exercise routine became an obsession, and for the past 10+ years I've consistently upheld an extremely rigorous and time-intensive exercise routine. I won't get into too many details here, but exercise was exhaustive and intensive, often combined with restrictive eating and intermittent fasting.Over the past few months, I've experimented with recovering on my own. I had a revelation while traveling around 6 months ago, and decided to cut exercise out of my life cold turkey. I'm sick and tired of being a slave to exercise, and my fixation on working out has truly, in retrospect, had a hugely negative impact on so many aspects of my life. I see other people living relatively more normal, healthy, balanced lives, not depriving themselves or beating themselves up with crazy amounts of exercise, and I recognize that I really want to live that way as well. I also want to have time to do other things, and be able to commit myself to people, relationships, other experiences, and my career, instead of just being focused on my workout all the time. Since this revelation about 6 months ago, my only forms of exercise have been low-intensity walks with my dog, and gentle-moderate yoga. A far, far cry from what my life has been like for the past decade.It has been tremendously difficult to figure out how to feed myself properly without my usual intense exercise regimens, and over the past 6 months I've really been experimenting with how and how much to feed myself. I have zero hunger cues, so I often feel like I'm stuffing myself, even though I know that the reality is that I'm not meeting my ideal daily intake for food. That said, I really do feel like my body is blowing up. Presumably this is a result of so many years of stress and semi-starvation on my body, but I'm already well within the "normal" BMI range and heading rapidly toward the high end. I am not binging or purging at all, just trying to be reasonable about what I eat and make healthy, sane choices.I'm feeling really frustrated about what feels like a massive weight gain in the past few months, especially because mathematically it doesn't compute. However, I know that a big part of recovery can sometimes mean weight fluctuations and water retention. I guess I'm just really surprised because I am by no means anywhere near underweight, yet still my body seems to want to hold on to everything so hard.What is recommended for recovery from exercise addiction? How do you deal with the weight gain?What helps best when struggling for 10+ years and goning through multiple recoveries? Especially for those recovering well into adulthood (I'm close to 30 years old)?I really appreciate any advice. I haven't been able to find much information on what to expect on my recovery from exercise addiction.Kind thanks for those of you who have taken the time to read and respond to my post. Your comments mean so much to me.
Hey everyone, I was thinking about writing a long post about my background, but I find it better to just divide it into a TL;DR post.Point 1: I love foodPoint 2: I'm afraid of eating too much foodPoint 3: I'm underweight and was told by my parents and a doctor to gain more weightPoint 4: I'm eating a lot, but just not quite enough to gain weight. I know I can eat more and more, but I'm afraid I'll go off the deep end. I'm still afraid of food (counting calories) even though I'm consuming a lot more than I used to.Point 5: I've been following this trend of "weight gain" for about 2 months, but my weight has been stagnant/slowly declining for the last year and I have yet to see any progress.Point 6: My dad is overweight and I fear that I will become like him if I keep following this lifestyle.Question: Is there such a thing as "overeating" in AN recovery? I've been trying to pinpoint the perfect number of calories for me to eat, but I'm completely ignoring my hunger cues and am avoiding sweets because of it. I feel like I'm living a healthier life, but I'm not sure if I'll ever make any progress this way.Question 2: If I do go off the deep end and finally start gaining weight, will I be able to stop? Will I be able to slow down the weight gain once I reach a healthy BMI, or will I gain a new eating disorder and become overweight? I want food so much right now that I feel like I'll get addicted once I start eating food carelessly again.
A little background I am 18 year old female and have struggled with my body ever since I was 13. I am currently underweight. I didn't want to admit that I am sick, but it's time to face my fears. I hate/love my body. Some days are really good for me I will eat a normal 3 meals and a couple snacks, but other days I will only have maybe one meal and drink a lot of coffee and this will go on for a couple weeks. I had my first accident of not eating and passing out. It scared me a lot and I realized I need help. That lasted a couple days and now I am back to hardly eating anything. I came to this site for help and to see if any others have been in my situation before.What is the best first step for me to take towards getting help?
My SO has an eating disorder and depression - she wants to start running in order to "get in shape". However, she is already slightly underweight and I'm afraid running would push her to a dangerously low weight. Beyond that, I'm afraid she wouldn't know where to stop. On the other hand, exercising is often listed as a great way to help with depression and would probably help boost her self confidence. We go on walks together fairly often, but I'm not sure if it counts as exercise enough to her - she really wants to run. I want to do whatever I can to help her with the depression, but at the same time I don't want to make the eating disorder worse. I would really appreciate any other advice you guys could give me as well in order to help. Thank you in advance.
Thought you guys might be interested in my senior thesis on a Eating Disorder Recovery Center. We did 6 months of research (which I came to you guys with some questions), and 3 months of designing. Thank you so much for your help![Here's a link to my thesis on issuu](http://issuu.com/heathergaboury8/docs/thesis_book_final)
I'd like to post the following to gain some advice or insight about healthy dieting for someone prone to ED behavior.I've never had a full-blown eating disorder, but I've been unhappy with my body/weight for as long as I can remember. In my early teens, I began using some really unhealthy restrictive eating habits, working out daily and always monitoring the scale. I forced myself out of these habits in high school, because I saw a documentary about anorexia that scared me shitless.I'm 22 now, and a bit overweight after college (though definitely still at a healthy weight). I've gotten really into the gym and want to trim down in a healthy manner, but every time I start to lose some weight I'm tempted to "speed it up" via not eating. It's so easy to slip into unhealthy restrictive eating.Is it impossible diet/lose weight in a healthy way once you've got an ED kind of mindset? Does anyone have any tips for how I can healthily diet without it being so triggering? If not, support is welcome as well.
I'm a 29yo female at a healthy weight. I've recently realized I've been using food and restriction as coping mechanisms since my childhood, and my situation is getting progressively worse.A year ago I noticed I had put on a lot of weight after an injury had prevented me from walking (or leaving my house, really) for 2 months. I started dieting immediately, lost some of the weight I intended to lose in a healthy manner, then began restricting a lot. I restricted to an unhealthy amount for some weeks, before starting to binge. This was last february; come march, I was bingeing and purging on a regular basis, generally at least a couple times a day (sometimes as much as 4 or 5 times). I managed to start restricting again for 3 weeks, then skipping meals, then fasting for a couple of days at a time. And then the b/ping came back. I'm now trying to at least avoid purging, but I feel sick all of the time and I'm so scared to gain back weight I feel like (no kidding) killing myself.On the outside, though, I don't look sick. I'm a very normal, average woman, on the high end of a normal bmi. I feel unworthy of help when so many people with "serious" eating disorders are so much thinner than I am. I feel like an impostor, and I'm too ashamed of my fatness to ask for help. I don't have the resources to look into counseling, and there are no free services available for this type of issues in my country (that i know of), but even if there were, I could never bring myself to be subjected to ridicule because I complain about purging and restricting when I'm not particularly thin.So far I've admitted to my problem with only one person close to me, who urged me to seek help, but I can't. I just can't. I feel hopeless and ashamed of myself. I see mysellf as a disgusting glutton without an ounce of self control, and a part of me still mantains (despite the evidence to the contrary) that I should be able to recover by myself, in secret. That I should be able to just "turn it off".I guess this came out as an incoherent rambling, so, to cut it short...**Is there a meter to judge if someone is sick enough to deserve help?****If yes, do I have a chance of resolving my issues by myself and move on without becoming a joke for some professional looking to help real sufferers?**Thank you in advance for your help. (Sorry for any mistake- english is not my native language.)
I'm 22/f, recently diagnosed with BED, and in a very peculiar situation that involves near-unavoidable contact with many of my trigger foods. I am currently on a cycling journey with 28 other young adults across the country. Our team feeds us breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and many of the foods are ones that require a lot of self discipline for me to be around. We eat meals as a team. Because of this, I've had three total binges (each progressively worse than the others) on this trip thus far-- and want to hear from you all- what has worked for you when you've been put in environments around your binge foods -- to prevent from bingeing? I buy greens regularly to increase satiety and to round off my meals, as well as leave the eating area when I'm done. Anything helps!
So I'm fairly certain I have an ED (I think it to be AN). My entire life I've always been a picky eater but as of this moment I've started to notice that it has cost me relationships, as soon as some acquaintances found out eating habits I would hide from them only eating in isolated places as to not be judged. I am extremely skinny and have lost whatever muscle I used to have. I've noticed an increase of hair growth (everywhere but on the top of my hair which has actually started to recede a lot), dry skin, but most importantly I seldomly have an appetite and when I do it makes me feel noxious to eat.Anyways I'm a baller on a budget and don't have an insurance. My family has some money but they aren't very convinced (when you have been around me for most of my life and never thought to mention "Hey, maybe you're AN" it makes sense that you were only aware as I was). Just looking for some advice and maybe an idea as how much 30 day inpatient was for those of you that had it?What other suggestions for helping myself?
I've never been diagnosed with ED but I've had some nasty bouts with anxiety and depression. Currently I'm trying desperately to gain weight as my husband and I are trying to conceive, and it has been impossibly difficult. I've never eaten much and it is generally very healthfully. However, I tend to just not eat. In December, after some difficult marriage troubles, I became very underweight. I've gained some weight, but am still underweight. Whenever I eat I feel physically sick.  Understandably that makes me not want to consume the necessary calorie/day diet I need to put on weight. I've been to my GP and they can find nothing wrong with me. My husband has suggested I try counseling for an eating disorder. However, I am not afraid of gaining weight-if I could snap my fingers and be my goal of a healthy weight, I would. But I feel as if I have a hangover every time I eat. Do you think I should seek ED counseling? Do you think it could be a benefit (that perhaps this is psychosomatic) or since I don't have the accompanying mental symptoms that it would be a waste?
There are not a lot of Eating Disorder 12 step groups on Los Angeles and being a 12 Step guy, support groups don't do it for me and OA doesn't either.Does Anyone else want to start a Eating Disorders Anonymous Meeting in Los Angeles?Has anyone started a group like this elsewhere and how did it go?
Hi, I'm a 20 year old female. I'd really like some advice about whether or not I have an ED. I don't particularly want to talk to my mom about it unless it's serious, because she's told me she had an ED when she was my age and would probably freak out. (She is a wonderful mother.)Basically, I'm just terrified of gaining weight. I weighed a little more than average two years ago and lost that, and that really isn't enough. I cry thinking about my body and I log the calories on everything I eat. I restrict my calories greatly but then will feel bad about myself and eat a lot, then restrict, etc. I work out almost everyday, though I still feel like I'm not at the right weight. I do not purge.If someone asked me what the worst thing that could happen to me was, I'd say gaining weight (disregarding anything happening to my family).I am at a healthy weight for my height, so can I have an eating disorder? Or is this just a matter of a bad self-esteem?
My partner (M) and I (F) suspect that his roommate (22M) has bulimia. He tries to cover the sounds by briefly turning on the shower or the sink. I also suspect that he has used some type of laxative (some red liquid?) as he offered it when my partner had indigestion. He has dark circles under his eyes, gaunt face, usually wears baggy clothes, and has lost a lot of weight. My partner has tried to talk to his roommate about it, but he has always denied it. I'm worried that if no one talks to him about it now, it will never be addressed. He is a Latino, first-gen college student with little financial resources - how do I approach him about this? Should I approach him? I've known him for 4 years and we're friends, but really only surface level. I don't want to ignore this problem, but I don't know how to approach it. I'd appreciate any advice. Thank you so much for your help. 
To preface, both my sister and I have been going through weight problems and were frequently shamed by our parents as we were growing up due to our weight. My sister has always been fairly skinny. She was an athlete in high school and used to exercise frequently. When she left high school it took a turn for the worst. She stopped eating a lot because, from what she told me, many of her peers would tease her about how she ate a lot of food. her condition has been deteriorating and last summer, she actually attempted suicide. She was sent to a help facility. She was eventually released from after she told them what they wanted to hear. After she got out, she started making an effort to intake enough food, but when she left for college in the fall, she fell back into her old habits of not eating.Throughout the year, my parents have been trying to help her, but she gets angry with them and confides with me about how oppressive they are to her. I've tried to tell her that maybe my parents are right, but when I do, she becomes angry that I'm against her. She came home this week for my high school graduation and seeing her state made my heart sink. She looks very sick and underweight and she looked extremely weak. My parents recently told me they had given up and had no idea what to do for her because she wouldn't ever listen to them. I'm really concerned for her health and I really don't want to give up on her because she's my sister and I love her. Anyone have any ideas on what I can do?
My gf went into self-guided recovery for her anorexia around the time we got together (3 years ago), and she considers herself recovered now. She doesn't have the eating disorder she had before, that much is true--she's now a healthy weight, and she claims she doesn't consciously restrict. And she no longer identifies as someone with an eating disorder, which in itself is a big step.She still has unhealthy body image about 50% of the time, calling herself or specific body parts fat when she clearly isn't and they obviously aren't. If I try to reassure her that she's not fat, she tells me she doesn't believe me and that my opinion of it doesn't matter. If I try to get her to compare her body to other peoples' bodies to show that she's not fat (ie, "you don't think I'm fat, right? well I'm bigger than you, so you're not fat either, then, right?") she says the way she evaluates her body has nothing to do with the way she evaluates others'. She also claims that her assessment of herself as fat or not has nothing to do with her self-esteem/sense of self-worth now. I don't know if I believe that or not.She also still exhibits behaviors, particularly during times of stress. In fact, I might go so far as to say it seems like her eating disorder resurfaces during times of stress. She claims she "can't eat" when she's stressed out. She frequently skips meals and/or eats "meals" that nutritionally and calorically don't qualify as a full meal, and she'll get mad at me if I try to tell her it's not enough. Again, she claims that she's not restricting or even trying to lose weight. I can always tell when she hasn't had enough to eat, because she's very irritable with me and mentally slow/foggy, but she's completely unreceptive to any feedback in that regard. I know that she used her eating disorder as a coping method for stress/anxiety and depression, and it's my theory that she unconsciously falls back on these coping mechanisms now, but can't see it because she's convinced herself that her eating disorder is over.She doesn't count calories or monitor her intake or weight anymore, but she's really not as recovered as she thinks she is, and I really worry about her. Since she gets mad when I voice my concerns about it, how can I gently guide her to the realization that she's got a lot of recovering left to do?
Hello, my girlfriend is fighting to recover from anorexia, but she's having some really severe trouble, and I can't find anything very helpful in the previous discussions. So, I was hoping for some advice.She's 23, suffering from anorexia, she’s currently at a very low BMI. She recovered (physically) once before in a programme at the hospital, but immediately returned to low weight and unhealthy behaviours. She talks all the time about how much she wants to recover, but is paralysed by the fear of taking too much food, eating abnormally, becoming fat, and she say that the voice in her head is too strong no matter how hard she tries. Right now her and I are living with her mother in the hope that it could be a safe space for her to recover.But recently, I've learned that she is obsessed with her (very thin) mother’s portion sizes, and body shape. At every meal she eats less than she wants to (this she admits) because her mother has eaten far less than her. She finds herself unable to take eat something if her mother isn't eating one too. She also obsesses over what her mother eats when she is away.She's very conscious and rational about the fact that she needs to become healthy, but she is having terrible problems actually doing any of the things she talks aboutHow can I help her push past her fears?
My 15 year old daughter has developed an eating disorder over the past few months. Aside from the things the hospital recommended (not let her go into the bathroom 30 minutes after she eats) what are some other things I can do?It seems like every time I go into the bathroom, there is puke on the floor, or all over the back of the toilet seat/rim, or in towels. Is it wrong of me to make her clean it all up and punish her for not cleaning it up if she doesn't? I am not sure how to go about this, but I am getting tired of cleaning up vomit everyday.
Hi, my girlfriend is 19 and i'm 21. We're far away from each other at the moment so it is a little more difficult. i've known my girlfriend for a long time but we have been together for a year as last month. She had an eating disorder through high school, she would starve herself, make herself throw up and often pass out. She went to programs and for a few years there was a lot of frustration among her family because of her eating disorder. She is feeling better about herself now a days, she doesn't do any of the behavior which caused the eating disorder but often she will be hard on herself for eating something bad which i can easily talk to her about and make her understand one thing doesn't change everything. Often she tries to talk to me about how bad she feels about herself a week before her period and she'll 1 or 2 days where she is down and she dislikes aspects of her body through out the day. She tries to tell me what she hates but i just get so frustrated because i can't do anything. I get so so angry (not at her but at the fact that she hates how she looks sometimes.) I don't want to get angry anymore when she tells me this stuff, i just love her so much and i can't help it. How should i go about helping her when she is feeling like this? How should i go about listening and what is the appropriate way to react?Thank you, i just really want to help and i don't want to continue my behavior because it's not helping anyone.
So I have been in recovery for an eating disorder and seeing a therapist since March. We have made some good progress but I realised I transferred my control from food to exercise. For the last few weeks I have been working out many hours per day, running many km most days and binging as a result. I had a bit of a breakdown on Sunday and having seen the psychologist yesterday we decided I should take a week off. (At least). I am petrified.I haven't done any exercise for 2 full days and I feel so guilty. The voices in my head are strong and telling me I'm a lazy so and so and I'm worthless and telling me not to eat because I don't deserve it. It's day 3 today and I feel so bad and this is so hard. Any advice ? any stories / experiences / thoughts would really help....
To begin, I'm not exactly good with words, so I apologize if this is written poorly and I hope I still make my point very clear. My friend has been dealing with (I'm very new to this subreddit so I don't know the acronym) compulsive purging for about two years now. She's had a long history of trying to go cold turkey on and off, but that really hasn't been working for her, as you might think. She's talks to me every day about how she feels like it is spiraling out of control and getting much worse and I'm getting really concerned for her. The worse part is, we are both high-school aged kids, so the help she can seek is very limited.Her parents have a very stubborn and gross mindset that mental illnesses like depression or eating disorders (and even allergies) are just people overreacting and don't actually exist. She outright told her parents about what she has been going through, and her parents told her that they not only don't want to spend the money, but they'd be embarrassed to have their daughter seek help for something like that. On top of all that, she's undergoing surgery in a few months, and she was told (by her parents) that the surgery could be effected by her eating condition. She's very scared, but she's also very timid. She told me she'd much rather keep purging than confronting her parents. What can I do for her as a concerned friend?TLDR: My friend is a compulsive purger, but her parents don't want her to seek help. How I can help her?

I'm a 16 year old male, and for the past year I've had significant struggles with body image. For my entire childhood I had been heavier than everyone else, but not overweight to the point that I needed to lose any. However, over the summer I began to restrict my eating in an effort to lose weight. It helped a little, but I lost a massive amount of weight when I got the flu and couldn't eat for a week. Over the course of a few months with the combined restrictive eating and illness, I lost a significant amount of weight in a few months. I was aware that this weight loss was unhealthy but I finally felt okay with my body when really I shouldn't. My physician and my parents told me that my weight was in a really low percentile for my age and that if I didn't gain more weight it would be bad news if I got sick again. For most of the schoolyear though I became even more obsessed with nutrition labels and calorie counting and not gaining weight. I literally had to look at the nutrition facts of EVERYTHING I ate but I thought I was still eating healthy. I started to realize the damage I was doing to my body though around March when I needed to count the number of calories I ate for a health assignment. I forced myself to eat more than I usually did but still clocked in below my recommended amount. On a regular day I was probably getting significantly less than that. I've seen the errors of my ways and I'm now eating more and I'm eating 3 meals a day almost every day. However, I'm still terrified of losing weight. My parents want me to gain some weight but it sounds repulsive to me. Even though I would be a healthier weight the thought of being fatter sounds horrible to me. I need advice on how I can accept my body and how to cope when I start to gain the weight back? Thanks.
I am over weight and hate it. I decided to start losing weight and in addition to eating healthier and more moderately, I have started to throw up after "bigger" meals.I am not anorexic, I don't binge like a bulemic. Is there a word for me?
Need advice on what to do about my sister who is both anorexic and bulimic. She's at a dangerous weight and mentally she isn't the same person. I've tried talking to her but she shuts off at any mention of her problem. She has 2 kids and I'm terrified of calling CPS, because either her ex will get them (absolute loser that can't take care of himself) or my parents (they drove her to this, we believe our mother has munchausens. plus she absolutely hates them and we are planning on moving out by august).Other information- shes 31 and been dealing with this for a year at most. And she had this same problem when she was 16 -18? she was eventually placed in a live in rehab. So there's at least a 10 year gap where I don't believe she was suffering from these problems.
I'm getting married in a few months and going through various "life stressors" and feel like I'm beginning to relapse back.Does anybody have any good places to get free ebooks or pdfs besides the generic NEDA, etc? I have several different hard copy books but would like to read them before going to bed on my iPad, while my fiancè sleeps. Thanks so much in advance!! :)
Shes's(16) been admitted to hospital for anorexia and self harm. I'm(20f) wanting to give her some moral support but I'm unsure how.I was raped by our cousin when I was 6, then by the next door neigbour at 15, and I've been self harming since I was about 10-11. I don't think she knows any of that as our family has a very hush hush mentality about anything bad.I haven't seen or talked to her for a few years, but I want to be able to give her some support if she feels so inclined. I want to be able to tell her that I can relate to how she's feeling, but I don't want to make it about me, so I'm unsure how to even mention the eating disorder, as I've heard many people don't want to even hear those two words. How do I go about writing something supportive without stepping on any toes? Any help is greatly appreciated.
So I've been looking around the internet for some help but I figured I should have started here in the first place. This may be a little wordy but please bare with me.Background: I'm in love with a woman with an ED. She is the most compassionate, intelligent, and beautiful person that I know and she has been struggling with her body image and eating habits for at least five or six years now. We're both in our mid-twenties and we go back about 9 years. We've lived and worked together for a year before college and then fell somewhat out of touch until about a year ago. We still tell each other everything and we are slowly rebuilding our relationship and working back to a point where we are best friends and lovers. I'm going to marry her one day. I've known about her struggle for a while and I'm still somewhat lost on how to help her.She has a pretty messy family life and has fallen out with her dad and one of her siblings. She has also dealt with depression.What I know about her ED (please correct me if I'm misinformed or just being ignorant on something, I'm trying to learn as much as possible): She is very upfront about her struggle. She fully acknowledges that she has an ED and has sought help in the past but just moved to another city and she's hesitant talk to any professionals about it. It has been at least a year since she has last talked to a therapist. Based off of what I've seen and what we've talked about, I know that she is extremely unhappy with her appearance. She doesn't look unhealthily thin but I know that the physical and psychological toll can be hidden. She was never heavy, overweight, or anything resembling that. She regularly under-eats or skips meals which seems like anorexia(?) and consistently talks about how much she hates her body. She regularly tells me that she needs to lose weight and sometimes says it is because she wants to impress me. That freaking kills me.Sorry about the extended background info, but I want to make sure I give enough context before I ask a whole bunch of questions.So here are my biggest questions:1. **Where is the line between pushing her too hard to get help and letting her do things at her own pace?** I don't want to push her away and seem callous but I'm scared that inaction will become too comfortable and nothing will change. I was pushing very hard for her to see someone again and she told me to stop until she at least moved to her new place (she just got there this week).2. **How do I show her that I love her body without seeming patronizing?** She is absolutely beautiful, top to bottom. I mean drop-dead gorgeous. I love everything about her body but I'm worried that she thinks I'm trying to fight the ED and not genuinely attracted to her.3: **I'm a pretty skinny dude. Is my size making things worse?** She's both shorter and skinnier than me but I still think that she has this idea that a girlfriend should be significantly smaller than the boyfriend. I've actually been gaining a few pounds intentionally to see if it helps.Thanks in advance for any advice, resources, etc. I've been really torn up about this whole thing and I'm just looking for some perspective. Any advice helps.
I have a history of depression, including lots of self harm and multiple suicide attempts. Around October of last year I had been without hurting myself in any way for about a year and three months, when I started self-harming again. I'll leave out the details, but I ended up being admitted to a mental hospital.After leaving, I became very conscious of my weight (I've always been sort of fat), and I restricted how much I ate. Between November and now, I've lost a lot of weight as a result of eating very little most days, and not eating at all some days. I've never purged, but I've tried.I weigh myself almost everyday, and I get really upset when I noticed I'm up a pound or two for whatever reason. I'm at a healthy weight now but I'm still trying to lose weight, and I'm still eating very little except when I'm around other people for an extended period of time so I'm expected to eat.Do I have an eating disorder? Or, I guess, does it seem likely?
Hi guys,I'm 22F, with a history of mental health issues (anxiety, self-esteem, depression) and a long term chronic condition. I'm fairly short and used to be, in my teenage years, pretty rounded. My parents said it was puppy fat, but I think they knew different.When I was about 17/18 I started changing how I ate. I said it was because of health stuff. I'd eat really small, inexpensive lunches. My argument was that I was allowed to keep all my left over dinner money. People started saying how much better I looked. I kept pushing for more weight loss.Aged 18 I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I was having daily panic attacks over being less than perfect. About failing. About letting people down. I started running: I'd run to reward myself, to punish myself, to break the monotony of life, to have a break from work. Sometimes I wouldn't eat properly before running, or after running. Aged 21 I was diagnosed with depression. Again, fueled by my self-loathing, my insecurities etc. Age 22 I was diagnosed with a chronic medical condition: I spent time at home, being fed by my mother, living on steroids. I gained weight. I was finally able to move out and get my life back in order.But I've found myself falling back into the same habits. I don't binge, I don't purge, I'm a healthy weight for my height. But I feel like food is one of the constants I have. When my day is bad, I know that food is something I can do for myself. That I can control it.I work in a highly stressful field. Things go wrong daily, hourly. It's a field where you can't be perfect, because perfect doesn't exist. There are too many variables to be perfect. But I find myself striving for perfect. I can't be perfect because of my anxiety, because of my job, because of my depression, because of my chronic condition. But maybe people will like me because I'm skinny. At least being not as fat as I was will make my life seem more in order.I weigh myself regularly, get sad if I eat too much. Get sad if I gain weight (even if it isn't real weight, it's that you've just drank a pint of water weight).I'm going to make an appointment to see a counselor about my anxiety and depression (I've realized that bouncing from relationship to relationship to make me happy isn't good enough). But I don't know whether to talk about food. It sounds stupid, but I don't know if I really have a problem or if I have convinced myself that this is an issue. That I am actually just a normal, anxious 22 year old who just wants to look and feel better, or if their is something more to it.(To add to this, if my work thinks that I'm mentally unstable, they take me off the job. Yay for another anxiety inducing issue!)TLDR: anxious, depressed 22F, not sure if I've actually got a problem or that I've talked myself into thinking it.

Hello :) I want to start trying to tackle my occasional binge eating and restricting, and I was wondering if anyone has any good resources they can let me know about? Like a good book or website that guides you through how to deal with binge eating?Reason why; I gained a lot of weight last year when I was very depressed. I just ate far too much all the time to cope with my depression. The extra weight ended up having physical impacts on me in that my hormone cycles are all off and not working as they should - to the point that I got paranoid and suicidal one week each month. :(I've made a start, I've lost some weight and am feeling better. I'm still borderline obese though and I want to lose weight and learn how to eat healthily for my health, because everyone in my family is obese and sick and I can't let that happen to me.So, I've done okay. Since march, I've been eating better than usual. Even if it's only making small changes here and there. I'm cooking more and consuming healthier food. But; I had a lot of binging episodes. Probably at least one weekly.  I struggled to eat my meals yesterday (but I still did!) and I'm worried the restricting/binging pattern I had as a 14-18 year old will return. I never got help, because I was always overweight, and none of the doctors believed me when I said I had trouble with food, and that my trouble was restricting, not the binging.Most information I have seen is just restriction or binge/purge type disorders - neither of which apply to me. So I would be incredibly grateful if you can share your resources for binge eating - any useful books, worksheets, or websites would be great :) It's also really hard to tell what's good and what's not when your new; so I'd love to hear what has worked for all of you :) tl;dr I have worked on most of my body image and self perception issues through therapy - i feel better about myself, mentally healthier and now i'm trying to lose the weight i gained when binge eating. i'm doing well so far, and am eating healthier than ever but i notices some old binge/restrict patterns coming back. I would like some self help resources if you know any :) 
To give a brief summary of what's happened to me. For most of high school I'd been on the thinner side (probably slightly underweight) caused from the fact I'd spent so much on my computer gaming and consequently skipped meals inadvertantly.Towards the last few years of **secondary school my mother passed from cancer**, I lost the few friends I had and fell in depression. The depression hadn't got really bad, but I only barely passed my final year. I had nowhere near the scores to get into university, but I didn't know, and still really don't, have any idea what I want to do.For whatever reason I decided to be healthier (I wasn't even unhealthy to begin with, I just didn't get out, and was use to years of missing meals because of gaming to early hours, sleeping in, and so on), but since I knew nothing about doing so, I started walking, then later running everyday. It helped with my mood regulation a lot, but because of my poor knowledge I under-ate and only ate how I thought was healthy.Since I'd been at a lower weight for a few years, you can imagine **my weight plummeted**without me even noticing. I suffered from a lot of the psychical symptoms but hadn't attributed it to the weight loss. I hadn't noticed the weight loss itself and was used to family members commenting on my weight because being thinner before losing a lot of weight. But on the coming Easter I over-indulged, which I wasn't worried or stressed, or anything about, I'd done it every Easter that I can remember as it was special since I never had the chance to eat treats at home because of my sister's allergies.But I think **because I was so underweight that it threw me into months of binge eating** everyday, causing havoc on my digestive system, extreme bloating and brought back my depression. It scared me so badly because I had no idea what was happening. I just spent months in anxiety and physical pain. But because I hadn't had any ED related thoughts or anxiety, I didn't attempt to make up for the over eating in any way.I hadn't seen a psychologist in over a year (I'd seen two over the two years prior), but went to see a different one because I had no idea what was happening to me. While I don't feel she helped that much (didn't help to build a healthy relationship with food, or eating normally or anything), it allowed me to vent a bit (but didn't quell my fears in why I was over eating) but lead me to the path of my current job I've had for about a year.The over eating stopped once I got on track with a part time job, but only (which I didn't realise at the time) was because I went back to two meals a day because of my hours always being early and thus I went to bed early missing dinner.So as you can imagine again, I lost all the weight again (which I didn't even notice again, which surprises me because it scared me when I saw images of myself so gaunt). Although Easter came around again and I'm now in the same predicament again. Luckily this time I did did research and quickly find out why it was happening, and how much I had needed to eat versus how much I had been eating.Which brings me to now. I've been binge eating everyday since Easter, par one or two days where I couldn't eat or was only able to eat one meal because I felt so sick and had constant diarrhea. I'm struggling really hard to get myself to eat three meals with snacks all of which reaching the intake I needed (so not to undereat). I'd unknowingly restricted certain foods when I was underweight only because I thought they were unnecessary or unhealthy. But knowing what I know now, that there isn't anything unhealthy or bad, that isn't all moderation (which made sense with every other part of my life, helping my thoughts and mood regulation to do with my depression).But **the binge eating now is putting my job at risk** because I'm calling in sick too much and I'm worried my boss thinks I'm going out, not actually sick, etc. I'm gaining weight so quickly I'm worried I won't able to come in because I won't fit in my clothes anymore. **I'm in constant physical pain** and **really anxious** and **I feel like I could slip back into depression**. I'm angry and I yell at my father a lot. He's the only one I've told everything I've been through.I'm scared what's going to happen. Getting a job for the first time helped me so much, with the social aspect, confidence and money. Most people got their jobs in high school, and later went to university. But I finished poorly, which didn't worry me too much I just focused on the next step which lead me to the job. But I scared that's going to all fall apart. I'm trying to work on getting a hobby and finding friends after not having any at all for years but the binge eating has thrown me over.I'm really happy I've regained the weight back, not only because I like the way I appear more, but because it's brought back my libido and I feel so much more energetic. **But I can't seem to eat normally** no matter what I try and the stress and pain is excruciating, especially since it's everyday.I don't know if this is even the right place to ask this because **I don't know if I've ever suffered from an ED**, but I've noticed a lot of similarities in the physical symptoms, but never had any disordered thoughts or was weight/body image conscious. The only thing I think I might of had was orthorexia, I don't even know if it's considered an ED.If I don't do anything, is the binge eating going to taper off eventually? Is what's happening to me a normal part of returning to eating normally? (I've read from those who've had anorexia and had the same thing happen to them during recovery, but I don't know if it's the same for me) **What can I do that'll help me not binge or restrict?**(I'll just mention in case it's important, but I'm a male).
Over the past year, or maybe more, I have been binging and purging. It's difficult for me to admit, but I understand that it is what it is. It's beginning to consume my thoughts, and I fear for what might happen.What I'm wondering is, what are my options. I don't really want to "come out" to anyone. What avenues are available to me (specifically in Canada)?Thank you for your time.
Hiya. So, I was diagnosed with severe EDNOS last year and had a really rough go of it - but I've been on the recovery track since about February and today I'm just trying to maintain my goal weight. I have up days and down days, and a few things still set me off sometimes (eating in front of others, eating certain foods, etc), but all in all I can feel my relationship with food getting close to normal-ish again.I'm home from University for the summer, and that means being around my parents. My mom has a history of anorexia and eats very, very little. She also makes a big show of when she is full after small meals (puffing out her cheeks, talking about how stuffed she is and how she could never eat any more) and comments about what others are eating (like if a portion looks large or if something is unhealthy). All of this happens more often when she is stressed - and, just our luck, things are stressful at her job and at home right now for reasons that I won't explain here.As you've probably guessed by now, her behavior REALLY bothers me and makes me anxious about food. I feel fat and uncontrolled around her. I feel guilty for eating at all - today I'm pretty sure she skipped dinner, and we all went out for froyo after but she refused to have some. Half of me is running around in circles in a nervous panic, vowing to restrict better tomorrow, and the other half is trying to just stay calm and on-track.Any advice for how to handle this? Should I talk to her, or just make more of an effort to avoid her at meal times? How do you deal with a close friend/family member with eating habits that trigger your own ED?Many thanks.
Skipping one meal doesn't mean you have an ED. But what about purging? How often do you have to exhibit disordered behaviors before you know something is seriously wrong?
Due to some pretty heavy physical and mental issues in the past 6 months, I've been going to doctors, psychologists, been put on anti-depressants, and finally today I was at a psychiatrist to make a diagnosis: He said depression and anorexia.But I'm having doubts. It's true that I am very preoccupied with my weight, and that it's one of my primary goals to not gain weight - I'm very physically and mentally weak atm, so I've scaled back to have as few goals as possible, and I've settled on staying in school and keeping my weight under control (since I used to be morbidly obese). I used to have so many goals.I don't think it's unreasonable to want to control my weight after all that work, and most slim women do control their weight, even if it doesn't require as much mental effort as it does for me.The 'stress' it causes me might as well have been on something else, I don't feel like my emotional turmoil is because of food and weight, it just so happens to be one of the things I focus on right now. Like, I could have been perfectionist or obsessed with a number of other things, I would feel the same, but the diagnosis would be different.So I feel like the anorexia diagnosis might be 'distracting' and misleading to the underlying cause of my physical and mental issues? I feel like as soon as the psychiatrist heard that I had lost a lot of weight, and did not want to gain any, he completely equated that to all my symptoms. He's asked me to write down everything I eat for 14 days. I don't know if he thinks that will prove anything?Can doctors misdiagnose anorexia?Could a restricted diet contribute to my mental and physical issues?
It started with just being self conscious about my weight. In 2012 when I moved to college, I started eating healthier since I was living with my aunt, so I lost weight. I've never been overweight, or even chubby, I was normal but I got thinner and people noticed it, which made me feel really good about myself. A year and a half later I moved to live alone and downloaded a calorie counting app, so I started losing weight consciously and willingly, just by counting the calories. My family and my boyfriend have told me that I look way too thin now, but when they say that I kind of feel good with myself, even though they intended to tell me I looked sick. Obviously none of them know that all this weight loss is intentional, and since my career demands me to stay up all night sometimes, I blame it on the stress. My concern here is, I've lost all the weight I planned to, but I'm afraid I could gain it back again so I keep eating small amounts of calories daily. I don't want to lose more weight, but I am really afraid of getting heavier again. I can't eat certain foods without worrying after or while I do so, and actually (Despite I know it's only mental) feeling my butt getting full of cellulite after I eat high-calorie food. I'm not happy with my body after all this weight loss, I'm only happy with the numbers. I wish I could care less about my food. I'm afraid to be actually anorexic, because I've heard you can have anorexia even if you don't look like you do. I sometimes eat a lot and then feel very bad about it. Do I need help? How to be happy with my body and not worry about my weight?
I feel as if I've tried everything as far as attempting recovery is concerned. I've been in therapy since I was an adolescent and I feel like I'm stuck in this vicious cycle of restricting, purging, and bingeing.I went a year restricting. I lost so much weight I was on the verge of hospitalization. I was given a clinical diagnosis of malnourishment. Then I'd have occasions where I would finally break down and eat, and then subsequently I'd purge out of guilt.Now I guess I'm what you would consider a normal weight, but I'm far from recovery. I'm completely obsessed with food, consumed be self-hatred, and an uncontrollable urge to eat. At times I eat to the point of being nauseous and bloated but will continue to eat anyway. It all feels so familiar, I've been going through this "cycle" for years now.Restrict & purge. Then binge and binge and binge. I'm so sick of this, I feel like I've done every exercise, read every book, and quite frankly feel like I've exhausted all my efforts. I feel like I can't stop. Like I'll never have a healthy relationship with food. Sometimes I wonder if its even possible to recover from this. Does anyone have any advice/insight they could give? Anything would be greatly appreciated.

I technically have bulimia but honestly I see it more as a binge eating disorder because I honestly hate throwing up and i avoid it for as long as possible. I sense its more of a binge eating disorder because i can not literally help my self around food because i know i have a way to get rid of the food via throwing it up. It honestly disgusts me how hard it is to control my self i can go all day eating healthily and then its in the am's and there i find my self surrounded by plates and wrappers. How can I control my binges? I do not purge after normal meals, only when I binge, so I think I need techniques to prevent binges. How can I handle the urge to throw up after I binge? Thanks
Hi all, I am struggling with finding the willingness to be committed to my ED recovery. I have suffered consequences both physically, emotionally and spiritually and have been through several treatment episodes. My first treatment episode was twelve years ago and my last was almost four and I am twenty five now. I am currently in a relapse and struggling to gain and maintain a healthy weight.I feel completely stuck at this point. I think I want to get better. I feel horrible but still struggle with being completely willing to do what professionals suggest. More importantly, I am not sure how honest I can be with myself.I still find myself getting defensive over things that are stupid and I think I lack the faith that I'll be completely okay. I have currently begun (re)attending a 12-step group for my ED and I see people who seem happy and willing but for some reason I don't believe that will be me- which is not rational.What has been the catalyst in your willingness to move past resistance in dealing with your eating disorder? Is there something I can do to feel more ready and committed in recovery? Any words of wisdom please!

I'll keep it short as to not ramble on.- I developed anorexia aged 15 after my brother's suicide- After 5-6 months I transitioned onto bulimia, it was officially diagnosed and I was under mental health services. I was not at a healthy weight.- For the last 8 years thereafter (I'm now 24) I've had lengths of time bulimia-free with lengthy relapses in continuous cycles, but I am a healthy weight- Aged 19 I was diagnosed with a personality disorder- I'm currently having a bulimia relapse which started in JanuaryAs I've grown older I've questioned why I was one of the few who develops disordered eating, and furthermore - was it because of my personality disorder or my trauma aged 15? Predestined or by chance of events?I'm incredibly lonely, and suicidal. Ive struggled my whole life with making friends (most likely because of the personality disorder), my job is a very serious job, and demanding mentally and physically. I have a long term relationship but my other half has bipolar and it can be toxic at times. I also have a gym obsession. My SO has a demanding job which leaves me quite lonely. All of these things are relevant as my bulimia almost comforts me in my times of sadness and anxiety. On the flip side, knowing the seriousness of bulimia adds to my anxiety, but it's the only way I know to settle the rest of my negative feelings.I've tried many prescription drugs over the years and I'm happy to cope without them, or at least try to. I've exhausted all therapy options, but I'm on the verge of blowing my lid.I don't wanna be like this any more.Will I ever break free from it without damaging all aspects of my life? How will I manage, and what could I do to help myself?
I would really appreciate some support. I am girl from Russia battling with her anorexia. And it is so hard for me because in Russia the anorexia community is enormous and it is even considered to be beautiful. How can I not succumb to the pressure to be anorexic?What do I do?
I lost some weight after taking Zoloft for 6 months. Because of the crippling nausea and weight loss, I stopped taking the pills. I have been off of Zoloft for about 6 months, however my appetite never quite came back the way it was, and sometimes I experience lingering feelings of nausea. Does not hinder my ability to function though. I noticed that recently I've been overly concerned about gaining weight and am at a lower weight.I do not eat breakfast, but usually eat something small once at work, and lunch later. I eat dinner occasionally however as my boyfriend is out of town and I hate cooking, I haven't really been eating dinner. And this is fine by me. I am pre-occupied by the size of certain body parts. I know that I look like a 12 year old because I have an extremely flat chest as well, so it can't possibly be appealing to those around me. BUT, I can't bring myself to eat more and gain weight. So, my question to those who think they may have an answer, is whether or not you think this is an issue. I do not count calories or have eating rituals, nor do I see fat in the mirror, but I am almost obsessive about food and what I do or do not eat. Usually I will restrict eating if I'm feeling depressed.
I have had anorexic tendencies for the past five years. I was officially diagnosed when I was hospitalized a year ago. Things got better, I wasn't "recovered", but eating a meal didn't count as a binge for me. Now. I'm worried I'm relapsing. I didn't eat for an extended amount of time, and after fainting, I decided to have some plain food, which made me sob. I'm becoming so afraid of eating, to a degree completely unfamiliar with me. Is this normal relapse behavior? What should I do?
I was recently admitted for an overnight stay at the hospital and since then I've seen a dietician, a therapist, and a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with an unspecified eating disorder about two weeks ago.So now they want me to go into an intensive outpatient eating disorder program. It'll be about 4-6weeks (or however long I need it), Monday thru Friday, from 8:30am-5:30pm. It's about a 40min drive one way from where I live. If I do it, I would more than likely lose my job (I'm a student worker on a college campus) because I would have to take those weeks off. I would also lose about half of the money I get from the VA (veterans affairs) for education because I wouldn't be able to be enrolled in classes (I have to take at least one on campus class for full benefits). Overall, I'd lose the majority of my income for two-three months, and my job.My question is: is it worth it? Is it possible to actually get better/manage this or would I just be wasting my time/money? I want to get better, I'm tired of feeling like, this but I don't know if it's worth everything I'll lose?Also, does anyone have any experience with this type of program in general?
Over the past few months, I have been restricting without tracking my intake.Now, my parents have forced me to start gaining weight. I want to gain weight, too, and I've started tracking every single thing I eat to make sure that I'm eating enough.This makes them happy, but it makes me miserable. I miss being able to eat things without having to track, and now I won't even eat something if I don't know its caloric value.How do I stop thinking about calories? it doesn't matter what my perspective of food is (good or bad), calories will never not be on my mind. I have forgotten how to eat for pleasure.
**What causes an Eating Disorder**Eating disorders are complex illnesses with a genetic component that can be affected by a wide variety of biological and environmental variables.Eating disorders include a range of conditions that involve an obsession with food, weight and appearance.  The obsession is often so strong that it disrupts an individual’s health, social and familial relationships, occupations and daily activities. It is estimated that over 10 million people in the United States suffer from eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder, and the statistics are growing.Research on the causes of eating disorders is constantly evolving, and we continue to gain increased insight into risk factors that may contribute to the illness.  However, the answers remain multi-factorial, and they reflect a complex combination of biopsychosocial factors that may intersect differently for each person.**Several major risk factors for eating disorders are outlined below.****Genetics**Increasing numbers of family, twin, and adoption research studies have provided compelling evidence to show that genetic factors contribute to a predisposition for eating disorders.1 In other words, individuals who are born with certain genotypes are at heightened risk for the development of an eating disorder. This also means that eating disorders are heritable. Individuals who have had a family member with an eating disorder are 7-12 times more likely to develop one themselves. Newer research is exploring a possible epigenetic influence on eating disorder development.  Epigenetics is a process by which environmental effects alter the way genes are expressed.TemperamentSome of the genes that have been identified to contribute to eating disorders are associated with specific personality traits. These aspects of personality are thought to be highly heritable and often exist before the eating disorder and can persist after recovery.2,3 The following traits are common among people who develop an eating disorder but all of these personality characteristics can exist in the absence of an eating disorder as well.4,5    obsessive thinking    perfectionism    sensitivity to reward and punishment,  harm avoidance    neuroticism6 (emotional instability and hypersensitivity)    impulsivity, especially in bulimia nervosa    rigidity and excessive persistence, especially in anorexia nervosa**Biology**Even in healthy individuals without eating disorders, states of semi-starvation have been shown to trigger obsessive behavior around food, depression, anxiety and neuroticism that promote a continued cycle of starvation7.  Additionally, brain imaging studies have shown that people with eating disorders may have altered brain circuitry that contributes to eating disorders.8,9  Differences in the anterior insula, striatal regions, and anterior ventral striatal pathway have been discovered.  Problems with the serotonin pathway have also been discovered.10,11 These differences may help to explain why people who develop anorexia nervosa are able to inhibit their appetite, why people who develop binge eating disorder are vulnerable to overeating when they are hungry, and why people who develop bulimia nervosa have less ability to control impulses to purge.Trauma**Traumatic events such as physical or sexual abuse** sometimes precipitate the development of an eating disorder.12-14 Victims of trauma often struggle with shame, guilt, body dissatisfaction and a feeling of a lack of control.  The eating disorder may become the individual’s attempt to regain control or cope with these intense emotions. In some cases, the eating disorder is an expression of self-harm or misdirected self-punishment for the trauma.  As many as 50% of those with eating disorders may also be struggling with trauma disorders.  It’s important to treat both conditions concurrently in a comprehensive and integrated approach which is why The Center for Eating Disorders offers a specialized treatment track for women and men with eating disorders who’ve also experienced trauma.Coping Skill Deficits**Individuals with eating disorders are often lacking the skills to tolerate negative experiences.**  Behaviors such as restricting, purging, bingeing and excessive exercise often develop in response to emotional pain, conflict, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, stress or trauma.  In the absence of more positive coping skills, the eating disorder behaviors may provide acute relief from distress but quickly lead to more physical and psychological harm.  Instead of helping, the eating disorder behaviors only serve to maintain a dangerous cycle of emotional dysregulation and numbing feelings.  Effective treatment for the eating disorder involves education about and practice of alternative coping mechanisms and self-soothing techniques such as in Dialectic Behavior Therapy.FamilyThe family is an integral system in the healthy development of a child and can play an important role in the recovery process. Unfortunately, in the past, parents were often blamed as the sole cause of their child’s eating disorder. As more research is done on the diverse contributing factors discussed above, it becomes more and more clear that this is not the case.  While stressful or chaotic family situations may intersect with other triggers to exacerbate or maintain the illness, they do not cause eating disorders.  Its also important to note that some family dynamics, which were once assumed to be precursors to an eating disorder, may develop as a response to a family member’s struggle with an eating disorder.  The Academy of Eating Disorders (AED) recently released a position paper that clarifies the role of the family in the acquisition of eating disorders. The paper points out that there is no data to support the idea that anorexia or bulimia are caused by a certain type of family dynamic or parenting style. Alternatively, there is strong evidence that family-based treatment for younger patients, implemented early on in their illness, leads to positive results and improvements in conjunction with professionally guided family intervention.  While parents and families are not to blame for eating disorders, they can play a role in helping kids establish a positive body image, one of the most important protective factors against eating disorders.Sociocultural Ideals**Our media’s increased obsession with the thin-ideal and industry promotion of a “perfect” body may contribute to unrealistic body ideals in people with and without eating disorders.**15,16 An increase in access to global media and technological advances such as Photoshop and airbrushing have further skewed our perception of attainable beauty standards.   In 1998, a researcher documented the response of adolescents in rural Fiji to the introduction of western television.17,18 This new media exposure resulted in significant preoccupations related to shape and weight, purging behavior to control weight, and negative body image. This landmark study illustrated a vulnerability to the images and values imported with media. Given that many individuals exposed to media and cultural ideals do not develop clinical eating disorders, it may be that individuals already at-risk, have increased vulnerability to society’s messages about weight and beauty and, perhaps, seek out increased exposure to them.Dieting**Dieting is the most common precipitating factor in the development of an eating disorder.** In the U.S., more than $60 billion is spent every year on diets and weight-loss products. Despite dieting’s 95-98% failure rate, people continue to buy dangerous products and take extreme measures to lose weight. Restrictive dieting is not effective for weight loss and is an unhealthy behavior for anyone, especially children and adolescents.  For individuals who are genetically predisposed to eating disorders, dieting can be the catalyst for heightened obsessions about weight and food.  Dieting also intensifies feelings of guilt and shame around food which may ultimately contribute to a cycle of restricting, purging, bingeing or excessive exercise. 9.5 out of 10 people who lose weight through dieting gain back all of their weight within 1-5 years; half of them gain back to a weight that’s above their starting weight. More worrisome though is that dieting is associated with higher rates of depression and eating disorders and increased health problems related to weight cycling. Intuitive eating and the health-at-every size paradigms are recommended as alternatives to diets for people looking to improve their health and overall well-being. References1.

For several years in high school I was underweight due to anorexia, but now I've been at a healthy weight and with generally healthy behaviors for three years. I still have compulsions to overexercise or not eat enough when I'm stressed out but I don't give into them and haven't for quite awhile. My doctor at home knows my history, but my doctor here at university does not because I go to a different doctor most times I have an appointment about anything because that's how the student health center works. Basically, I'm wondering what I need to worry about? What kinds of health issues could I be at high(er) risk for than people without this history? What should I look out for?
 I'm diagnosed with **severe depression and anxiety**. Which may impact this a little.I am **overweignt.** I'm **transgender male to female** if that applies at all, so my whole life is a crazy mess essentially.I dont really eat if I can help it. Its not like I need to starve, I just dont want to eat too much. I know what I usually eat is terrible for me so I try to reduce portions. I'm losing weight. Which makes me happy for sure. I try to weigh myself each night to keep track of stuff. I dont think its a problem, I think its making me waaay healthier.So what my dad said. He just asked me if I was eating and I said yes and all that. He said alright and I asked why he asked and he said I sleep too much and seem sick. I mean yeah, **I sleep a lot.** If you leave me in bed I'll sleep from 8pm to 8pm the next day. But thats just because I'm a **teenager** and I'm depressed and there isnt anything else to do. I don't feel very sick.Once last month I did throw up. Like on purpose. But it was once and we went out to eat and it was a lot and its not that big of a deal. I've not done it before. I wont do it again unless I eat like a shitton which I never will.I mean I'm blatantly overweight, I cant have an eating disorder when I'm not even a healthy weight yet, or can I?  I just want to lose weight and this is how I'm doing it and it's worth it.   **So what makes it into an eating disorder vs just dieting?** Is it more the intensity like how much you worry about it? Or the methods, like dieting or just binging or purging.Just because I know I have binged and purged before and I'm not really thinking I have a disorder as much as I'm really focused on losing weight. Or like hyper restricting intake like avoiding eating at all vs eating 'healthier' foods?I suppose for example : somebody prefers to not eat and they are overweight, so losing weight is logical. It may be kinda unhealthy but would it be worth it?Or if somebody worried about calories and weighing themselves a lot, and based their intake on losing weight very quickly vs carefully, is this an eating disorder or dieting?
Hello Reddit, I love my girlfriend a lot and want to try to help her get over her eating disorder. She's at a healthy weight and doesn't seem to have huge body image issues. She does think she's kinda fat though :( Anyways, we're going through a tough time financially and haven't been able to keep buying weed(which is legal here, WA state) and now she can't eat anymore. Apparently solid food feels really gross in her mouth and she can't get it down. It makes me sad to see her struggle like that and I want to help.Does anyone know anything helpful? I just don't really know what to do. I could try to get more weed, but that's not a real solution to the problem. Thank you!
He was sexually assaulted by his ex girlfriend of 2 years last year, and experienced a very traumatic breakup. As a result he suffers from anxiety, and it has manifested in anorexia - has no appetite, he 'forgets' to eat, or says he doesnt feel hungry. He eats a small amount once a day. I've asked him about it and he says he doesn't have an eating disorder, but i know he used to suffer from one, when he would work out at the gym and overexercise (I'm not sure what this is called) I'm recovered from an ed which was triggered by similar circumstances and I'm really worried about him. What can I do?
My girlfriend has been diagnosed with non-purging bulimia and is 9 weeks into cognitive analytical therapy (CAT) for it. I appreciate that these are still relatively early days for the treatment but so far she doesn't seem to be getting much if anything out of it.My concern is that she may have misrepresented (**lied about**) her condition to the therapist from the beginning, which might make the whole thing a waste of time - or even damaging. I feel I should have been involved in some way in the initial sessions to ensure the therapist got the full picture. At the start of the process I was trying to give her space and privacy to deal with the issue herself - she hates talking about it - but now I think this might have been the wrong approach and I'm not sure what to do.As I see it, there are two behavioural aspects to her condition, plus a third that may or may not be related. The first is very occasional **binge eating (without purging)**. The second, constant, aspect is a **phobia of any food she feels is fattening**. Finally, I think she has an unhealthy relationship with **alcohol.**The foods she feels are fattening include major food groups. She's very bright and, intellectually, she knows that this is totally upside down nutritionally, but she remains phobic of these foods to the point where the prospect of eating them makes her **panic** and break down. This happened most recently in a restaurant last night when we the food arrived with an unexpected "fatty" sauce on it. I discreetly ate both meals to avoid the waitress asking if there was a problem (which would have freaked her out even more). After we hurriedly left, she started crying and comparing herself negatively to the other "skinny" women in the small restaurant - who were, objectively, a very similar build to herself.The **alcohol issue** isn't quite as clear cut but is definitely worrying. I know alcohol / substance abuse is often linked to eating disorders. She doesn't get drunk every day. She never gets black-out drunk. It doesn't affect her ability to function. She can go a couple of weeks without a drink without suffering (although this is rare). But she does drink a significant amount almost every day, irrespective of whether I'm drinking (usually I'm not). If we have a bottle of spirits in the house, it will be gone in 3 or 4 days without me touching a drop - sometimes without me even knowing it was there. She feels she needs a drink before bed to sleep well. We've discussed this - she knows I'm concerned about it but she doesn't accept she has a problem. I have at times resorted to secretly pouring a couple of shots of spirits from the bottle down the sink to try to limit it a bit (she doesn't know about this).I should say that her weight is perfectly healthy - although of course she doesn't perceive it that way. She doesn't purge, her sometimes **inadequate food intake is balanced out in calorie terms by her alcohol intake** and she exercises most days. Her diet isn't terrible - but she has a limited and unvaried diet.Before she began therapy, her perception was that her only real problem was the **bingeing**, because it makes her gain weight. From my perspective, that's actually the least of her three issues - because it's so infrequent. I'm much more worried about the constant **excessive diet control**, **body dysmorphia** and **alcohol issues**. I'm pretty sure she will have minimised these points when speaking to the therapist, and I wish I'd been invited to attend an early session to give my perspective. We discussed it a bit after last night's panic attack in the restaurant and she says the therapy is covering the diet control point - but as she's never perceived it to be a significant problem I'm not sure whether I believe her. She also says that the therapy is overwhelmingly focused on her early relationships with her family ("We don't really talk about the actual current food issues.")Apologies for the long and rambling post. As with most other boyfriend posts on the subreddit, I'm really just trying to find the best way to support her. I'm just worried that she'll spend 6 months in therapy and get nowhere because she hasn't been completely honest with herself or her therapist about what her problems are. I'm also not convinced that CAT is the right approach in the first place - the success statistics look poor to me - but there was a several month waiting list for CBT.
I have been having increasingly greater problems with my binge eating in the past few months and have been finding ways to control it. I can keep it under control until I come home from a long day (College student, athlete, working = long days) and mindlessly binge to the point that I have to purge directly after. This happens every day and every day I say the same thing to myself: "This won't happen tomorrow."I need some advice/ tips on night time binging. I want to eat a normal amount for dinner and be able to be done for the night without eating everything else in sight.
2 years ago I was diagnosed by my counselor with an ED. I did not want to ask my mom to get treatment because I did not think that she would take me seriously, and I thought that I could fix it myself. I am now 20 years old. I did manage it for a while, but recently have been under a lot of stress, mostly because I have major depressive disorder and I guess I feel like if I can control my appearance it will make me happier. I realize that this isn't right. I want to get better I just don't know how, and I don't have insurance so I cannot get proper treatment. If anyone can please give me a treatment plan to retrain myself how to eat, be healthy, and love my self again I could never repay you. I'm making myself ill and I am so exhausted from being sick all the time. Thank you.
This book got me recovered.First of all, pardon my bad english! I've struggled with BED and Bulimia for 3-4 years, and can proudly say that I've recovered 90%. I don't think anyone can recover 100%, but I'm very happy with 90. I used to think about food all day long, always thinking I was fat, trying out new diets all the time and let food control my life. I isolated myself and was angry all the time.The doctor put me on a lot of meds, made me talk about my childhood all the time to find out where it all started without any progress. One day I came over this book from one of the many youtube videos i watched about recovery; [brain over binge](http://brainoverbinge.com/).  I don't get anything for sharing this.It really saved my life. I quit my meds almost right away (which I should not have done. Lower your dose gradually.) I feel like it's my duty to share it with others that need help and don't know how to recover from Binge eating, anorexia or bulimia. This book gave me a new perspective on life and on food. It's all in our heads! You've made it a habit. That's just it. It's all just a habit that you need to break out of, and this book teaches you how to do so! It's written by a woman who shares how she recovered, after struggling almost her whole life and she teach us through her book techniques to do when we are at our lowest!Let me know if you read it. If you need help, comment. I wish to support you all! If I can do it, so can you!!Edit: Please notify /u/sarahsdiary when you reply to this
I've been living with my boyfriend's family for nearly a decade and spent most of it obese (BED). I lost weight the typical way for a while, until last year when I went through a pretty severe 5 month restrict-purge cycle and lost a decent amount of weight, though I'm still on the higher end of healthy weight for my height.When my boyfriend realized what was happening, he asked me to try for recovery. It's been about nine months since then. Nine painful months, honestly. One of my main struggles has been staying on a healthy path, knowing that his sister is bulimic, and that when she isn't purging, she's absolutely restricting and exercising to a degree.I don't really know what to do. I can't exactly move out in the middle of us trying to get our lives together, and I can't confront their parents about it without admitting that I have the same disordered behaviour -- especially when I'm still trying to lose weight and their mom tells me I should stop being so militant about my diet (I'm not. I'm vegan). I also can't say much because they don't know for sure that she's still bulimic.So how do you cope when you're trapped in a house with someone who is clearly suffering from the same ED you're trying to recover from? This is the first time I've really sat down and started looking into recovery communities and I'm excited about the links on the sidebar, but I'm really not sure where to start when a permanent part of my life is still connected to eating disorders.Thanks for reading, any help would be immensely appreciated.
A friend of mine (male) has anorexia. A doctor informed him but didn't give him much direction other than "eat more". He doesn't consciously starve himself to my knowledge, so he doesn't really have any idea how to combat this if he never really feels hungry. Any advice I can pass along that's a little more specific/motivating than "eat more"?
(English is not my native language, sorry for any mistakes)A couple of weeks ago my social worker pointed out I might have an eating disorder. I was on a diet when some terrible events that caused me a lot of emotional stress happened and I discovered not eating as a weird source of comfort for me. While I wasn't able to control the circumstances I was in, I at least could control my eating. I lost a lot of weight in a scarily short amount of time.Time passed, things got better at home and my eating habits changed a little bit. I still restricted and exercised but not nearly as bad as before.Now, things have again gone downhill and so have my eating habits. I now obsess over my weight, it's all I can think about and not eating is currently my only source of comfort. The lesser I eat the better I feel. Again, people noticed and the social worker pointed out a possible clinical therapy should things not get better.I was all for it but then someone pointed out that you usually get calorie dense foods and I freaked out.We are talking near hysterics. I'm deadly afraid of gaining weight and I'm trying to avoid certain foods at all costs. I also fear that people won't take me serious because I'm technically still in a normal weight range.I'm not officially diagnosed with an eating disorder since my social worker is not qualified to do so.How can I get help and find out if I have an eating disorder, since my social worker cannot diagnosis me?How can I overcome my fear of foods and weight gain in order to seek treatment?
My friend admitted to having Bulimia today. I attempted to ask her about it and she told me she has not told anyone else, not even her parents.Not sure how I should continue, all I know is that I should be careful about what I say.Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you so much.
Male, 24 years old here.I will keep it short. Two years ago I hit my lowest ever weight and my face looked awful, like a skeleton with gaunt cheeks and dark circles that went from the corner of my eye right onto the top of my cheek. I am now back to my former, healthy weight and whilst my face has filled out a bit I still look gaunt and the dark circles remain.I want my youthful face fat back. Is there anything I can do to help my face look fuller?Isn't the face normally the first place to fill out? How can I deal with weightloss induced dark circles? Can anyone offer any insight?
I cannot begin to describe how much or even what running means to me. i started at 14 and haven't looked back since. Nonetheless i have recently FINALLY stopped counting calories, and although it feels so liberating i have gained a bit of weight and i am very apprehensive about it. I don't know how to cope with it. i do have more energy but i am very tempted to go back to tracking calories and macros even though i know how triggering that is for me. How can I safely run and stay on track in my recovery?
I've been dating someone for 5 months now and things are going great, besides the fact that I've just developed bulimia. Another problem is that we're in a long distance relationship. I'm hoping someone here with experience in how ED affect a relationship could share their story and maybe even give me some advice. Thing is I worry if I can handle a LDR while struggling with bulimia, and I also worry about how he might take it. But hopefully by reading what you guys have to say I'll be able to decide what to do - or at least be more aware of how my BED may affect him (I believe he has the right to know what it means to be in a relationship with someone who has bulimia).
I have questions for people who have recovery under their belts. Did you ever get back the thickness of your hair? My hair has thinned significantly since I relapsed and I am wondering once I have some solid physical recovery under my belt if my hair will get some of its body back. Much appreciated.
Whenever I'm under a lot of stress, or really anxious i starve myself. I don't want to though, I don't want to lose weight but I can't stop myself from not eating.Does this mean I have an eating disorder? And does anyone know anything that might help me over come this? Please help.
My girlfriend and I are in our 20s and have been dating for several years and one of the things I fell in love with her for was her love of food. She would eat just about anything and I loved it, she was never significantly overweight, but throughout the time we've been dating, she's gotten lighter and lighter. I come to find out about two years ago that she has an eating disorder where she hyper analyzes her body particularly around stressful times for her, typically around times where she's stressed out because she doesn't have control of the outcome. For her, her intake is something that she can control, so she uses that to feel like she has some control over her life.I'm struggling to provide a strong support network for her where I don't want to guide her or tell her what to eat, but she often goes through these yo-yoing phases where she'll eat all of the food she likes, and then she'll feel like she's losing control of her image and her life and will either not eat or eat small portions of "healthy" food.Can someone who has been on the other side of the table give me some advice on how best to help? She's been seeking treatment but I also want to give her a strong system socially and emotionally.
I have had a problem with EDNOS on and off for several years. This year it was more intense and I had issues with purging. Sometimes I find myself randomly having little throw up just randomly. i am involuntarily throwing up. What can I do about this?If it is related to my EDNOS, and how can I start to get help to prevent more problems?
Obligatory note: I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I'm almost certain I've been on the edge of anorexia for about a year. I went through a rough bout of depression last spring that led to me undereating every day. Food began to not look edible, even my favorite dishes. Anti-depressants helped get me back on track but i still eat much less than I should, and its not a healthy diet at all.Recently (about 1-2 weeks), when i would normally have a grumbling stomach, instead its just been crampy and generally/vaguely upset and not feeling hungry. Enough so that I don't feel like eating and the thought of eating or strong smells can make me nauseous.I'm unsure if this is my body progressing into a deeper stage of hunger/eating problems or if it could possibly be related to a new medication I've been taking. I'm taking minocycline for acne (once a day even tho it should be twice a day). The pharmacist says that it shouldn't make me nauseous at all but I can't help but wonder if its causing this problem.What could be causing this feeling?How can I eat enough when I do not feel hungry?
I have recently contacted a therapist about starting treatment for binge eating disorder, but have not yet had any real conversation with them and I have no idea what to expect. I have had anxiety issues for a long time now and have been to therapists unsuccessfully in the past, but I have been coping with stress by overeating nearly every night even as I tell myself to stop, and it has prompted me to really stick with getting help so I don't compromise my health. I am really terrified to begin, though, and really want some input on what treatment for binge eating disorder really looks like. I have known for years that I have an "unhealthy relationship with food", but now that it has turned into a real issue, I know I need help. But I desperately want to know what to expect from therapy, etc. I don't like going into things not knowing what to expect, and am terrified that I will stop going like I always have with therapy in the past. Does anyone have any suggestions, words of encouragement or advice?
I'm looking for some help regarding the treatment of BED with Vyvanse from someone who is/was a regular user of marijuana.For nine months, I have successfully stuck to a specific diet and lost some weight, reducing my weight from an "obese" to an "overweight" BMI. But my binging habits (which I recognize I've had for years) haven't stopped and have severely hampered sustained weight loss. In this time period I tried counseling, which unfortunately didn't help. I'm also a daily, but not heavy, marijuana user. I don't feel that my marijuana consumption exacerbated my binging significantly, although it definitely hasn't helped.For unrelated (job) reasons, I am no longer using marijuana for the next four to six weeks. However, I have a doctor's appointment in a few days and want to suggest trying Vyvanse (I've done the research on it and considering all other factors, I think it's a viable option for me personally). I am concerned that revealing my history of marijuana use will raise a red flag because Vyvanse has a high potential for abuse, but it's my understanding that urinalysis is pretty standard for amphetamines to check for dosage efficacy anyway.What's the best way to bring up this subject with my doctor? I fear that asking for Vyvanse, with a history of marijuana use, screams "drug seeking behavior," when I really just want to get my BED under control. 
Over the past 3-4 years I have been struggling with an eating disorder. I have recently done a lot better this past year and have gained weight. I have been looking at old pictures of myself and have become very upset that I am not as skinny as I was a year ago. I have been crying about it a lot and I just don't know what to do anymore and I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to. I guess I just need some advice for this situation.Why am I upset comparing myself to before? Who can I talk to about this?How do I deal constructively with difficult emotions?
This is clearly a sensitive situation and I need to be methodical about how I engage in this but can use any advice possible. She does not know I know about it but I read something she wrote on a paper about binge and purging. I didn't mean to find out something so personal this way and she is keeping her eating disorder a secret. She definitely has an eating disorder no doubt about that. I do not know how to support her in this and do not even know if this is a good place to ask.How can I support my girlfriend with binge purge ED?What am I getting myself into? We have been together almost a year now and are talking about long term life goals together. I love her so much and want to be a support system for her. Should I confront her about it or let her tell me when she is ready? I notice she always goes to the bathroom after we eat a big meal out in a restaurant and I don't think she is just peeing.One other thing to note is I know she has a counselor that she talks to regularly but about what I don't know exactly and that's her business but I assume it revolves around this. I also want to know what leads someone to have a binge and purge ED? I want to know what it is like being a partner in this scenario and set expectations for myself. Do I need to see a counselor to help me be supportive? Do I need to be supportive or hands off?  Thank you.
I was diagnosed with anorexia over a year ago and saw an ED specialist and went to therapy for awhile. I have gained my weight back and am a healthy weight.Sometimes people make jokes about eating disorders around me, and I'm not sure how to react. I've only told a handful of people about it, so the people making the jokes are never people that know. I've got a really good thing going where I seem like a very happy and non-fragile person, so people don't really censor themselves and probably don't think they'd ever have to watch themselves joking about EDs. I was underweight last year and stayed at that weight for months. It was noticeable that there was a problem, but nobody ever asked and I never told anyone I wasn't close with. Because of the bubbly exterior, I'm sure people assume nothing was wrong.How can I tell people that it's not cool to joke about eating disorders, especially around me, because that would involve me telling them about mine?I need help.
So recently my girlfriend has been going through a lot with regards to her EDOS and ive spent time googling what I can do to help her. But I thought I would ask here for a more personal approach. She will often binge and purge, shes been very open to me about this. But I feel like I could be doing more to help her. We also go to the gym, she will run for a while but my PT said that people use exercise as a form of escapism. Pretty much im just looking for ways I can support her and try to avoid putting her into situations she feels like she needs to purge or binge.
I went through a phase of eating a very small amount and diet pill usage around 5 years ago (when I had low self esteem), I got more confident but my acne triggered my low self esteem and therefore made me hate my body almost as bad as I used to. I exercise moderately and try to eat healthy, I don't think I have a healthy mind set when it comes to weight loss/body image. I obsess over my body, my boyfriend has noticed that I just stand staring at myself for ages "sucking my stomach into unnatural poses". I'm considering diet pills again just to shed a little more weight. I'm a healthy weight at the moment according to my BMI, I know this but I still think I'm too big.I don't want to try to get help if it's just low self esteem and will go away because I don't want to rack up any more mental problems.Do I have an eating disorder, and should I seek help for it?How can I stop these thoughts and behaviors before it becomes worse?

To give you a brief history, my roommate and I are both in recovery for drugs and alcohol (3 years for me, almost 1 year for him). He also had an eating disorder back when he was using. He is pretty overweight and I am somewhat, but I am working on it through diet and exercise. Since I have been working on my body, I have been wanting to buy a scale. I mentioned this to him and he told me how insane he got over scales when he was using (restricting and he has ended up in the hospital for this before) and that he would probably do that again. This worries me; that he doesn't think he would have enough self control to have a scale in the apartment at all. Last night, he asked me if I had gotten a scale yet and I told him I wouldn't tell him if I did because I don't want him to start starving himself. His response to that was "How do you know I haven't been doing that for about a week now?"He loves to fuck with me, but I really don't think he was joking. I am worried about his health both mentally and physically. I am also worried that if he starts starving himself to lose weight again to get to what he refers to as his "heroin body" he might actually start shooting heroin again.As far as I am concerned, I could break the lease and move if that happens. The issue is that I really do not want to see that happen to him. I don't know how to talk to him, since I don't know much at all about eating disorders and he is incredibly hard-headed in general.How can I talk to him about his eating disorder when he seems so reluctant to share? Should I try to help him or just move out?I am sorry for how long this is. If I could get this posted and get some help with this, that would be wonderful.Thank you
I've been struggling with restricting and body image for several years. In the past year, I haven't been restricting very much (mostly due to guilt, since my parents are paying for a fairly expensive meal plan and I feel obligated to use it), but I often have urges to do so and my body image hasn't changed much.In the past, I've seen a therapist mainly for depression (she didn't seem too concerned about my body image/eating, since I've never gotten to the point of being very underweight), but I haven't had much else. I realize that inpatient isn't an option for me at my current weight and I've been having urges to restrict more, partially because I miss it and I hate my body, but also for the purpose of getting to a point where I'm "sick enough" for inpatient treatment.I realize how incredibly messed up that sounds, but it feels like I can't truly recover without that experience though. Like somehow if I make myself sick enough to need to be in inpatient treatment, my struggles will be legitimate and I won't be a normal weight teenager who just cries a lot about food and her body and used to "diet". Somehow, if I got to that point, I wouldn't feel like a fake asking for help to sort out my mind.I'm sorry if this is kind of scattered and doesn't really make sense. Any advice or thoughts on getting past those feelings and that desire would be greatly appreciated.What should I do about feeling I need to look sick enough to get inpatient treatment?I want people to know I'm having a hard time, how can I learn to deal with these inner difficulties?
I know my girlfriend is bulimic. Is just mentioning that I know, making clear there is no pressure to do anything, still potentially bad? How could I say something?Can people purge silently?Is there any surefire way to know if my girlfriend is purging when she is in the toilet? Is it plausible for a bulimic to wait four hours before purging? Is it plausible to purge last thing before and first thing after sleep? ---Mod edit: In replies, please do not share methods on "how to purge silently" (if there are any) or give information on how to hide being bulimic. OP wants to know how to help girlfriend, and if he some behaviors are plausible.
I have a loved one with a food avoidance disorder. I know it is a more rare eating disorder, especially in adults. How difficult is it to find a therapist for Food Avoidance Disorder in adults? I have also read that CBT and exposure therapy are most effective in treating this disorder. Can anyone who has struggled with this disorder tell me what has been helpful for them?
My partner has suffered from Bulimia (Binging and Purging) for many years. He claims that he is recovered, however based on the timeline I've created (anecdotes, friends, etc.) it seems like he last engaged in ED behavior most intensely about 6-8 months ago. While I do believe he is making progress towards recovery, he still exhibits some behavior that leads me to believe that he isn't as recovered as he claims. For example, he considers snacks meals that consist of two main ingredients, ruling out food groups and over-exercise.My questions are as follows:1.What are some signs or indications of things I should look out for that would suggest a relapse? He says he's recovered but I don't believe it.2.What is the likelihood of being "fully" recovered after only 8 months, and what is the likelihood of relapsing?3.What are some ways I can be supportive? In this case, he claims his ED wasn't/isn't about body image but rather about control.4.He is going into a very stressful time in his life, and lately he hasn't had much time to hang out, I don't know if this is him trying to isolate and engage in this behavior or if he is really just that busy. I spoke with a mutual friend (who has experience with ED's, and she's not so convinced he's recovered) and she feels that he's also pushing her away.Any thoughts, ideas, resources and advice would be excellent. Feel free to ask any follow up questions. I've been seeing him for 6-7 months and I don't have much experience with ED's. A part of me thinks this all might be okay and normal behavior, but I would like some input from someone who knows more about what is and isn't and what I should/could do. 
She was bulimic for a long time and now instead of vomiting she takes laxatives. What are the risks of vomiting? What are the risks of laxatives?
I'm 23 years old and I have an ED. I spend most of my days not eating enough and I don't know how to change this. I'm gaining weight because of my medication and its freaking me out and I don't know how to handle it and its becoming more and more obsessive. How can I get through a day without panicking? How can I eat more?Also recently I have found out that I have been eating in my sleep. Is it a stress thing? Is it a my body trying to get food even if I'm not awake to get it? what is it?
I'm 16 years old and I have always had issues with self-esteem. I'm constantly critiquing every little thing and blowing it out of proportion. I never tell anyone, because no one would understand. My parents do not believe in any mental illnesses, and my friends are all rather shallow and judgmental. I see myself as weighing much more than I do, I am at a healthy weight but I don't exactly know what I look like. I see a distorted version of whatever I truly look like. I get complimented fairly often, occasionally on my body and how it is an ideal shape, but I feel as though everyone is just lying to me. All of these thoughts have led me to go through a cycle of binging, restricting, fasting, feeling ashamed, and then the cycle repeats itself. I'm writing this because I have no one else to tell this to. I wish I could just live my life as a teenager, but it's becoming more and more difficult. I just need some help.
My girlfriend binged/purged this weekend after I left and it resulted in an esophageal rupture. It caused her to awaken late that evening with the need to vomit (not self induced). She lives alone and was very scared to see blood - and the realization that her BN has caught up with her hit her hard.I convinced her to see her general physician and she was open to that. She was honest with the Dr. about what happened, and the Dr. told her how important it was to avoid purging for the next week so as to not exacerbate the problem. But I was surprised to find out that she couldn't even go 24 ours without purging.I've been dating my girlfriend (31F) for a year and a half. 8 months into our relationship she was honest and told me she had been suffering from BN since she was 15, is on antidepressants, and has only told 1 other person about her BN in her life.I've read as much as I can online, and have always tried to gently broach this sensitive subject and express my concern, but she'll often refuse to talk about it. This episode with her esophageal rupture , vomitting blood, and inability to follow Dr's orders for 24 horus has escalated my concern to a whole new level. She admitted that she was upset with herself after reading about ED tips online (she sounded jealous). While normally a rational girl, she doesn't think she needs help, and I'm starting to understand how completely distorted her perspective is.Anyways, I'm not sure why I'm posting here. It has taken a toll on me as well. If she gains any weight then she closes off to the world. Unfortunately we live in a very remote area, but from what I've read think group therapy, or at least someone else to talk to would be super beneficial. Multiple times she has expressed the desire to talk to someone else, but there is no group setting here, only a psychiatrist who she refuses to see.. Additionally, I've reached out to a friend of mine that also has BN that I've recognized via Russel's Sign. I'm hoping to at least ask my other friend for advice, and see if she may be interested in talk to my girlfriend.Just spitballing here.... Would it be bad to privately reach out to her mom (who she's close with) and make her aware? I live in a small town, and happen to workout with her general physician at the gym - would it be inappropriate to touch base with the physician (also female) to discuss my girlfiend's condition? I'm looking for any words of wisdom.I think today I'm going to call reach out to the local psychiatrist and see what she has to say.It has been helpful to write all this down. It's been racing through my head all night. Sorry for the wall of text.
Hello all, It is the first time I seek help for my eating disorder. I always managed to keep an healthy weight but in my teenage years I was undereating because of stress, which later on turned into over eating and bulimia during high periods of stress. Now I gained weight in a few months as I over eat. I feel breathless and without energy all the time. I don't say anything to anybody even my boyfriend, who does not understand any hint that I give him (willingly or not). I have to say I am currently not leaving in my home country and I don't like my life here and I don't like my work, I hold it responsible for my high levels of stress, hence causing me to over eat. I can't fit in any of my clothes anymore and I am wearing only a black dress all the time. I can't go shopping as it is too depressing for me. I would like this to stop but I don't know what to do, I can't pay for therapy and I have in mind that going to therapy will make me even more sick once I am fully aware of the illness. Do you think going back to my home country would help ? I have a boyfriend here and I don't want to leave him but I hold my stay here responsible for the quick degradation of my psychology. I wonder if I go back if it would help or if I will just be as sick anywhere, but it seems my highs and lows are closely related to my confidence in my environment. How can I deal with this situation? What can I do to feel better?Thank you. Also, sorry for my poor English, it is not my native language.

Someone please help. I just need someone to talk to. I won't make this a binge-confessional, but I need to stop and I can't. I'm a type 1 diabetic and am making myself very ill. I'm alone and don't know who to turn to. I feel like I can't help myself right now.What can I do?
I am a 19 year old woman who attends university. I have a friend here who I am nervous for. She is extremely thin she is always extremely stressed about her weight. She constantly talks about losing losing more weight and if she indulges in certain foods, she gets extremely upset at herself. In addition to that, she is a dancer and we go to a university with a high prevalence of eating disorders because of the competitive atmosphere here. I do not wish to offend her in any way and do not want to hurt my friend, but also do not want to let her suffer from a possible eating disorder. What could I do to help her? What are some resources that have helped the people here?
My gf of 3 years has been showing some signs recently and I just don't know how to handle it. She's always been healthy and happy but recently I decided to start exercising everyday and got her into it, I figured it would be a fun and proactive bonding activity. Within the last 2(ish) months she's started limiting caloric intake, not super drastically but enough to where it progresses more it will be a real problem, and complaining none stop about being full after small meals, saying she has the mind of someone with an ED. She's still a healthy weight and has always and still claims to love food. She even acknowledges that she just really doesn't like her body type to which I reply she looks great and she just needs to learn to love what she has. Nothing is really helping, she doesn't seem to know what would help, and I have to admit I am not very good at handling this. I know its not a problem with logic but I just don't know what to do. How do I best handle this? Is it possible to tell if she has an actual disorder? We've always really bonded over our meals together so its really trying for me to not let this drive me totally crazy. I want to help

Let me just say that I can't believe I'm on here typing this. I'm fairly new to reddit however reading other's life experiences has helped me to realize how "normal" most of my cognitive processes are. I've been a chef pretty much since I graduated high school. I've had an awesome early adulthood--traveled the world, cooked in top restaurants in multiple countries, run my own restaurant by age 22, started my own (successful) health-food focused catering business by 23, and currently cooking for yoga retreats internationally at 24 (currently in Peru) with a specialization in certain foods. My obsession began around 6 months ago. I've always considered myself a very stable and level-headed person. My older sister was always the trainwreck--diagnosed with OCD at age 6, heavily medicated by age 7, and suffered a 10 year battle with anorexia nervosa/bulimia beginning around 9 years old. I was always her only friend and confidant and I was the only true witness to her inner struggle through her illness. She is much better now regarding her eating disorder but now struggles with substance abuse. Because I was so intimately involved with my sister's eating disorder I never considered that I may one day develop one. When I began cooking professionally I prided myself on my passion for enjoying food, regardless of it's effect on my health. When I began to focus on health food I became obsessed with education of what was "good" and "bad". I have truly made a career cooking what I consider good food for people so I'm very attached to a certain diet that is almost my trademark at this point. I am very good at what I do and to admit that I may have gone too far in my categorizing of "healthy" and "unhealthy" has been a huge step for me. But I really have gone overboard. I don't blame it on one factor--so much in my life has led up to this moment. I believe the catalyst event that began my body struggles was over two years ago--I was raped by an Indonesian fisherman with a spear to my neck--it's amazing how adrenaline will give you strength you never knew you had-- I was able to fight him off with my bare hands and escape, but the terror of the experience has not left my subtle body until recently. I was in denial for a long time about the long-term effects of such a life-altering experience. It destroyed an otherwise positive romantic relationship I was having because I was uncomfortable with intimacy--nearly 1.5 years later. Soon after I ended the most positive relationship I've had yet over my intimacy and body-image issues I began to be obsessive about my weight. I lost a lot of weight in the year in a half since my attack, but most of my weight loss was from positive lifestyle change  so I thought nothing of it. It wasn't until I was "left to my own devices" that things seemed to spiral out of control. After leaving my boyfriend I had a few fleeting rebounds with men who were quite close to me, but left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It was then that I began to go inward--obsessing over the "bad" food I ate when my self-control was not intact. After eating something as simple as that, I could fall into a guilt trap for days, depriving myself of essential nutrients.In the past six months it's just continued to spiral. To some degree, My career pushes me in the direction of cooking purer and purer food for a customer base that demands it-.  On the other hand, my obsession with control has gotten completely unhealthy. I limit myself like never before. I can't seem to step out of my boundaries without experiencing extreme panic and anxiety. Even though I am very thin and in shape, it doesn't feel like I am thin enough. There is a logical voice inside my head saying "You exercise regularly- you can afford to eat anything you want", but it's matched with another voice from a darker place saying "you're not thin enough, you need to gain more control!" As I stated before, moving past the denial stage has happened as recently as the last day or two. I realize I am in the early stages of an eating disorder and I need help but right now, the idea of eating another way, or even worse, putting on a little weight, is the most terrifying thing you could propose to me. I guess I'd just love a little feedback.Has anyone had an ED due to rape?How do control issues around diet and food and exercise relate to EDs?How can I get help?As I said, my whole career is based on cooking healthy food for others and I feel like such a fraud for having these issues when I've spoken out against negative relationships with food after all of this time. I know that I need some kind of help, because the idea of letting go of my preoccupation of control is too much for me to bear. Thanks for reading. Any advice would be welcome.
I am a 19 year-old female in college. I have struggled with body image since I was about 15 years old. I believe this may be due to my mother's eating problems, as well.I first struggled with binge eating. After constantly being teased by my family, I had gone on a strict diet and kept reducing my calories. I didn't want to gain weight, so I kept dieting.My psychologist intervened, saying I shouldn't be so concerned about my body and it would be fine if I increased my calorie intake. She asked to see my food diary, which I obsessed over constantly. I was really scared to increase my calorie intake and I told my mom about it. She told me I could lie on my food journal so that I wouldn't have to actually eat more. I did that for a while but I eventually listened to my psychologist and recovered.My younger sister has since developed a severe case of anorexia. She has had to be hospitalized for several days because of it. I have tried to stay out of the situation because I know I am not confident about my own body image. However, I can feel myself slipping away.I do limit my calorie intake and I really don't want to increase it. I find myself chewing food and spitting it out and I'm scared that I'll make that a habit. I don't want to gain weight but I don't want to ruin my health. I don't know what to do. I can't talk to my family about it because they just get mad. They say they can't deal with my problems, too. I can't go to that psychologist anymore because she only sees adolescents. I don't know where to turn at this point, because all of my mental health problems just seem to be getting worse and worse but I'm afraid of people thinking I'm crazy. I need advice. What can I do?Sorry for the poorly-organized post.
Hi, I was hoping I could ask for some advice on how to help my cousin. She's 15, and has a history of self harm, so I'm worried about her. Last week, she told me she, purged for the first time and has done it about two more times. She also limits her caloric intake, as well.She has self image issues, and sees everyone as beautiful the way they are, but sees herself as having too many flaws to count. She says that she's doing it because dieting and working out don't work for her, and because others have done it to lose weight, she's convinced it's the only way she can become skinny and pretty. I've tried to assure her that she's beautiful the way she is and that going on this path won't make her pretty, as that has to come from the inside, but as she lives in another state I'm not sure what else I can do to help. How can I help my cousin from get help?
I went to my first OA meeting last night and I basically panicked the second I heard the word "abstinence." Over the last couple months I've really hit bottom in my issues with food. I'm desperate, and I had no shame in asking OA for help. But, am I willing to go to any lengths?! I don't think I can abstain. I recently started a reading a book about Intuitive Eating and basically the FIRST thing they tell you is ABOLISH FORBIDDEN FOODS! And eat them uninhibitedly until the obsession has been lifted- and the authors and testimonies are seriously convincing that this works. But so are OA members, who abstain.I don't know what to do. I'm in another 12-step program for a different reason, and I love the 12 steps. I thought OA could help me, but I balked at abstinence.I need direction... Is the feeling in my gut that abstinence will fail me worth listening to? Or am I ACTUALLY afraid of trying..?If you have any advice, I am open to any and all suggestions. I just want to find recovery that works for me, that makes me passionate about owning my problems with food and coming out on the other side with experience, strength and hope.
I'm in a pretty rough situation with my girlfriend, and I'd like to get some perspective from other people fighting EDs since she won't talk to me much about it.Basically what happened was that she cheated on me, then after she told me about it she left for residential treatment. What she wants to do is completely sweep her cheating under the rug until she gets out of residential because she doesn't want to fight two battles at once.Her actions make me feel awful. I don't feel like it is fair of her to completely ignore the fact that she cheated on me for the next month or more. At the same time, I have always been fully supportive and caring of her fight with Ed. I'm just having trouble understanding why she prioritized things the way she did, and think that maybe some people here could offer some insight that I won't otherwise get to see.Why did she do this?
My very good friend suffers from anorexia and her parents have placed her in a clinic of some sort. I don't know too much about the clinic nor her disorder because she's very quiet and doesn't talk about herself much.She has access to social media and I am going to visit her tomorrow.  How do I bring this (her anorexia) up and make it a more 'comfortable' topic to talk about?Thank you in advance.
Hi, My girlfriend has been struggling with bulimia a long time. This has become an issue of contention in our relationship and I need support in how I can help her. I've run out of ideas and she refuses therapy of any kind. Thank you
Hi,I've suffered from bulimia nervosa for about 8 years, and before that I had diagnosis for anorexia for a few years. So I've lived with this disorder for about ten years, I'm 29 now.I've been in inpatient treatment center for about a year now. I have been there the longest of the patients. My weight is in normal range and eating doesn't cause that much anxiety anymore.My problem is that other patients trigger me. New patients, especially, because they are...well, really sick, physically too. I know I'm the biggest patient here right now, and it makes me feel awful.I do realise that this being a treatment center for eating disorders, being biggest isn't that...awful.But it feels that way.Is there something I could do to not compare my size to others and be triggered by their behaviour?

I am a recovering bulimic who was recently put on medication that has made me gain weight.I'm terrified that It's going to exacerbate my binging/purging, but need the medicine for my bipolar/depression. I feel trapped in a vicious cycle where my depression won't go away if l gain weight, but it also won't go away if I don't take my medication. What is your best advice for dealing with inevitable weight gain?
Hello. I am a girl in my early teens, and I'm worried I might be developing a bad relationship with food and body image.Around December I started trying to live a healthier life, striving for the "perfect body". I started working out regularly and cut out every unhealthy food. Now this is all very good, but I tend to get a little over obsessive with things. I'm not really sure how to explain this. I think a lot about food. Constantly. I pretty much want to eat all the time, even if I'm not hungry. I deny myself because its not 'healthy' to eat and I think I'll gain weight.I deny myself all unhealthy food all the time, at home or out in public. Always. Even though I really want to, and it makes me feel horrible. I can't eat anything 'unhealthy' without feeling horrible either. If I think I ate too much early on the day I'll starve myself until dinner and not eat anything else but that. I check every food label and do an 'estimate' how many calories I've eaten.My mom is also worried about me. The other day I completely broke down because of some food related stuff and she asked me if I needed professional help. I said no, but I'm starting to get worried as this is having a really negative impact on my life.I also worry an extreme amount about my appearance and find things I don't like about myself or aren't 'good enough'. Those things also make me really upset. I researched the internet quite a bit about some eating disorders and body dysmorphia and took some 'tests'. The results of the tests all showed that I needed help and stuff.I don't know what to do. Is this something serious? Is it just puberty? Part of being a teenager? I don't even know if I explained it well enough. I don't know who to talk to about this. Please help.
Some of my friends have become concerned about me and I was wondering if I had Bulimia?I'm a college freshman and things have been very stressful but I believe this goes back to my ex about a year ago. When we started dating I was at a low weight and was still self conscious and my ex told me he loved me either way, however, that changed. Eventually he told me to restrict the foods I ate and cut calories and eventually had me hooked on his Vyvanse because he wanted me to be as skinny as his exs.This is what led to my first binge I can remember where I had no solid meal for a few days and ended up consuming a lot when everyone went to bed that night. After that I felt like crap and starved myself but after that I only binged after his Vyvanse. Eventually I moved to college and broke off the toxic relationship and the unlimited dining plan took over my life. I would binge and then starve myself. It became harder so I used laxatives diets. It was and still is a cycle and I gained weight in 6 months and I've come to hate myself so much I can't even change my clothes unless the light is off. My parents aren't supportive because they don't believe in these type of disorders or let alone depression which I don't know if I have or not. I don't have money for therapy and Ive become really obsessed with monitoring calories. I wake up I think about calories and my weight. It's come to the point where I have all the calories memorized of all the foods at the dining hall. I don't make myself throw up but I do still use laxatives and starvation methods after my binges. My roommate doesn't understand because I usually have my binges on weekends when I'm alone and she leaves for the weekend and I've become so obsessed with how I look I haven't been able to wear anything else other than a hoodie for months and I feel so ashamed and I don't really know what to do. 
I was bulimic from the end of HS into college.  One day, about 2 years later, I was having some stomach pains so I decided to stop.  It's been (going on) 2 years since I quit and I have some questions.My teeth have turned quite yellow, but I'm accepting of that.  My real issue is with hair.  I've had a bald spot above my forehead for the past 18ish months and balding eyebrows.  One hasn't suffered much, but the other has progressively gotten worse since I quit.  Anyone in the know have any tips for me?  Ways to help heal it?  I was patient about it for a while, but it's shown no signs of healing so I'm getting annoyed.  Any help is appreciated, thanks.
For the last few weeks, I've almost completely lost my appetite. I frequently feel extremely, uncomfortably hungry, especially after having not eaten for as much as a full day, but I still cannot seem to eat anything. When I try to force myself, my throat is uncomfortable and I have trouble swallowing, my stomach usually doesn't like it (even for very mild foods) and eating is just generally an all-around unpleasant experience that I feel I just have no desire to take part in.I don't have body image issues. I'm a healthy weight, and I exercise regularly, and I've always been generally comfortable with my appearance. I have no conscious desire to avoid eating in order to lose weight or for any other reason, but I've also been under a great deal of emotional stress in my personal and professional life in the last few weeks, and I can't help but wonder whether my symptoms are psychosomatic. (I moved to a new city about a year ago and haven't really made a single friend since I've been here.) Lately my frustration with this has started to affect my work, and among other things. I'm making plans to make a career change and go somewhere else within the next few months, in the hopes that I can get past this with a fresh start in a new community.)I've also tried using marijuana to improve my appetite, with no effect.Anyways, my main question is this: is it possible that I've developed anorexia? There's a great deal of literature on the internet about "stress-induced anorexia," but it all seems assume that the problem starts with underlying body image issues which are exacerbated by external stress.I have a psychologist who I saw for some time and who I would ask about this, but due to an insurance marketplace issue I can't get an appointment until next month, so I was hoping to get some advice before then.Does it sound like I have anorexia?Does anorexia have to do with stress or is it all about body image?What can happen if I don't overcome this issue?
So I've always had an addictive personality, and I used to be really addicted to video games. (I would still be addicted to them now, but I don't exactly want that, so I got rid of all of my video game systems, so that I didn't have the temptation around me.) I've also lived my entire life with parents who are total foodies and who have encouraged me to eat unhealthy amounts of food. (My mom is a huge stress eater, and she's encouraged me to be a stress eater as well.) This has all contributed to what I'm pretty sure is Binge Eating Disorder.Every week, I go grocery shopping with my mom, and it's up to me to buy my own groceries, since I'm an adult and that's what adults do (I'm a 28-year-old female, just FYI). I tend to buy tons of snack foods, since there's no one telling me not to. My version of "snack foods" is a bit different than most people's, though, since I have acid reflux and hypochondria, so I tend to want to buy healthy-ish snack foods, they have no nutritional value except calories, but they aren't sweets. However, I do buy more of those things than I should, which leads me to my next problem: overeating.I don't have a full-time job right now (I do have a part-time work-from-home job, but it only gives me about 4 to 6 hours of work per week), so I have a lot of free time. I spend some of that time volunteering (I volunteer two days a week at my local library and two days a week at an organization for people who have autism like I do), but I still end up with more free time than I know how to handle. And I tend to spend that time alone in my room, mindlessly snacking. I like to snack for as long as I possibly can, until I feel over-full and my reflux kicks in. I also like to eat huge lunches, and, again, I tend to eat until my reflux kicks in. I feel like that stems partly from my aforementioned addictive personality (I love the actual sensation of eating, and these days, it's one of the few things I really enjoy, so I tend to do it to excess), and partly from the fact that I struggle with depression, and my depression makes me want to hurt myself and make myself fat.I know that I probably do have Binge Eating Disorder, but the fact that I don't tend to eat quite as much or quite as unhealthily as most people with BED (which, again, is due to my acid reflux and hypochondria) makes me wonder. So, any words of wisdom would be really appreciated.Does it sound like I have Binge Eating Disorder?Do people with Binge Eating Disorder binge on "healthy" snacks?If I have it, what can I do to recover?Thanks for reading, and sorry this was so long!
As the title says, I'm basically reaching out for help.I have no idea how to stop.I'm not totally out of control yet, but this binging and purging has been getting worse over the years. It started out when I was 12 and I wanted to "experiment with bulimia". Not such a good idea, in hindsight I wish I had never knew about it. Nothing really happened for a few years, I had an "experimental anorexic period" for a few months at 16, but that stopped before anyone really did anything about it; my parents weren't really around much to notice stuff going on. I was a stupid teenager. Anyway, fast forward, and at 18 my "bulimic tendencies" came back out and got worse, I was having random patterns of eating healthy and then going on binges. I would say I'd B/P probably every 6 weeks or so for a year. Then it got worse, Maybe B/P for a week straight once a month. And now, at 20, I'm B/P every week at least once or twice. It's getting out of hand. I'm educated in the health field, I know what I'm doing to my body and I know I need to stop, but I just don't know how. I'm too impulsive and can't stop doing it.What do I do? Is this something I need therapy for? I should mention, I've never been diagnosed with anything, hence all of the quotation marks around everything. How can I help myself?Thanks in advance.
I know that I have an unhealthy relationship to food. I have googled eating disorder and I have looked through /r/EatingDisorders but I feel like I pull symptoms from different places so I thought I'd ask all of you if you've got any insight. *I am OBSESSED. Unless I am completely engrossed in something (playing a show, making out with somebody, watching a movie in the theater, etc.) I am fixated on when the next time I can eat. I wake up and it's the first thing I think about. After a meal I'm waiting for the next appropriate time. *Food is ritualistic for me. I have a certain process for everything I eat. I disassemble and reassemble my sandwiches; I eat certain parts of cookies in a certain order; every bite has to be perfect, containing every element of the food. There is a particular procedure for almost everything. *I only eat what I consider "bad" foods alone. I initially did this out of shame but now (even though I do love making and sharing meals with others) if I get it in my head that I'm going to eat alone and someone else is going to be around I get angry. It almost seems like I get the gratification/guilt of eating something "bad" if I eat it in solitude, even if it's a salad. *I get furious if my food is not exactly the way I want it to be. I try not to show it but I want to rage when my food is not absolutely perfect. At restaurants I have about a hundred requests for servers because I'm so particular about my food. It's like every meal is sacred, like every meal is my last. *I get into patterns: I'm addicted to one food and need it several times a week for months at a time and then it's on to something else. *I don't eat until I'm full; I just eat until I'm not hungry anymore and I don't mind leaving food on my plate. (This confuses me because it seem atypical of binge eating disorder.) *I am overweight but not dramatically but I obsess over my size and wish desperately that I could look "normal." How I see myself fluctuates. My weight can stay the same but some days I feel massive and disgusting and some days I feel pretty. *My weight will often fluctuate drastically throughout each year. I will exercise and diet (basically starve myself) for periods of time until I am the weight I want to be, hold that for a few months, then go back to being overweight. *When I used to do a "cleanse" (don't worry, I quit that) I found a certain inner peace because knowing that food was not an option gave me some respite from my obsession. *Some days (I'm talking one or two days a year) I will just wake up and feel indifferent to food. I will not have to have my food perfect, I do not obsess between mealtimes, etc. I just feel so at peace on those days. *Eating actually does make me happier. If I'm upset about something and I get ice cream it's like my problems disappear for a while. I used to cut myself and the instant relief is very similar. But sometimes I eat because I'm upset about my weight. Other things you might want to know: I have bipolar disorder but I am medicated, I cook very healthy meals when I'm not intentionally eating "bad" foods, and I'm very social and have never had any kind of problems eating around people (aside from listed above). Thanks!
I can't help but feel guilty every time I eat. I always think about the amount calories I'm consuming and I especially feel guilty if I feel full after my meal. I know this is harmful thinking, but I really can't help it, so what are some ways I can stop feeling guilty?
We are both in recovery...me from anorexia and her from bulimia. We said from the start that we would not be with each other if one of us relapses. She had sometime of abstinence from purging (I think at most a few weeks). For the past few months, however, she has been acting on purging/bingeing-purging behaviors at least a couple times a week; this does not account for restriction behaviors. I, too, have acted on behaviors from time to time with exercise about two times a week on average. I've always been supportive and non-judgmental whenever behaviors have come in. More recently, I have found myself getting scared and frustrated. My ED gets frustrated because I am trying to not use behaviors and she continues to do so, which makes some parts of me fearful that I am going to get chubby and she will lose interest in me. She says she doesn't want to continue using behaviors and still does so parts of me are also confused. I've talked with her about everything and it's hard. What makes it hard is that I am afraid that she will think that she is not good enough and that she'll never be good enough and then stop being open with me and use behaviors because of me telling her about how I feel about things.The questions I would like input on are: What defines a relapse? Is it individualized to the person? Although, behavior abstinence is the goal how many times a week of b/p-ing is considered a relapse? Through work does its frequency per week get less and less? Is anyone else in a relationship with someone also recovering from an ED? If so, what comes up for you when the ED comes in and causes a disconnection between you both? What would you feel if your boyfriend/girlfriend, who was also in recovery from an ED, confronted you about your ED behaviors? What would be helpful to hear from your significant other?

6 years ago, I stopped eating because I was overweight. I would eat nothing for long periods and then binge and repeat. I overcame my disorder 5 years ago. After five years, I still suffer from muscle weakness, even with healthy eating habits, based on a diet of a nutritionist and muscle building in the gym, with a great coach, I have no results. Are there after effects related to an eating disorder that I should have a look at?
I've been in recovery from BP for just under a month. My stomach is really, incredibly bloated right now. How do you know if it's just water retention? Are there any steps I can take to help reduce the symptoms aside from drinking the tons and tons of water I currently down?My GERD symptoms have gone away, which I started getting right before recovery. I was bulimic for about 2-3 years off and on, with the later part getting very bad. I purged about 4-5 times a day near the end. I'm in therapy and have a nutritionist but how do I help this bloat?Also, I've skipped a period this month. I'm not pregnant. Is it normal to skip in recovery? I need resources!
I'm coming to terms with the the realization that I have Binge Eating Disorder and/or some kind of food addiction. I always thought I was weak, had no will power, I just needed to try harder etc. But I started doing some research and reading books from the library about BED and food addiction and I understood what's really going on. I have disordered eating. Part of me feels relieved to know I am not alone and that there is a name to put to the hell I've been going through for years. The other part of me is terrified to begin a journey of recovery because I have no idea where to start.I still live at home with my family and do not feel comfortable at all discussing this with them. Which leads me to the next question...how do I go about getting counseling or therapy for this? Do I just call any therapist? Or is it best to go to an ED therapist? Do most people go through insurance or is it out of pocket expenses?And to anyone who has been through this same journey please feel free to share your stories because I am really comforted by finding forums such as this after suffering alone for so long. Thank you!
Hi all. I am in the process of recovering from BED. I was binge eating in response to stress for 3-4 years and it ended up having very damaging health consequences for me. I am now recovering from this, changing my lifestyle, and working hard to eat less/better. I am seeing improvements in my health, too. It will still take a lot of work. And I still do struggle with desires to binge and relapse occasionally. But I think with some more time I will make it bake to a healthy place.However, the hardest thing for me to overcome is still the psychological burden of what happened. I feel incredible guilt and regret. I feel like I lost these years of my life and will never recover them. Feeling like I have to work so hard to regain my health is very psychologically frustrating. It's also hard for me to deal with the health problems that are still with me now. I feel pain from them and just feel intense anger and regret. How do people deal with these psychological/emotional challenges during recovery?I feel like even if I regain my health and recover from this, I will still have regret over this long period of time lost in my life.Does anyone else have any insight regarding these challenges?
I am an 18 year old male. I have had weight fluctuations since I was 11 years old. When I was 11, I lost a lot of weight at the urging of my mother. Soon I became obsessive. Shortly after that I started high school and my obsessive control over my diet slackened and I began to rapidly gain weight which I held on to for many years. I developed pediatric problems and symptoms of binge eating disorder. I won't bother explaining the symptoms, they were and are textbook.About a year and a half ago I somehow managed to regain control of what I ate. At first it started slow, and was healthy. But there was a tipping point and I started intentionally undereating whilst overexercising. I also started using laxatives, at first because I thought I was constipated but now I understand that it was symptomatic of my obsession. I went from the "Overweight" BMI category to the lower end of "Normal".Today, a year on from there, I'm in the middle of the normal range for my height. The road to this has been plagued with inner dispair and self hate. I relinquished my iron-clad control over my diet at the urging of my parents, just like when I was 11. I tried to use my fitness pal to facilitate healthy weight gain but I soon spiralled into old eating habits. My weight gain was slow at first. I countered my binges with restriction of food and drink. When that inevitably lead to more binging, I purged on occasion. In the final months of school I saw a psychologist who diognised me with the disorder. She didn't really help me, I saw her several times. Nothing changed except that being 18, I was allowed to drink. So I drank.I would binge drink when out with friends because it eased my worried mind. My concerns about food faded and I felt like myself. I could actually enjoy eating without guilt.However, I would wake up feeling angry at myself. I forced myself onto many diets. They all failed. Several times. So I drank. On occasions, I purged. It hurt. I drank. Eventually, I started habitually drinking when alone. Alcohol dependence was on the ticket, so I quit drinking. Since then I have been filling the void by chewing nicotine gum and drinking diet soda. However, as soon as I stop to attempt sleep, I have to eat. I can't resist. This usually occurs at night after a day of moderation (or obsessive restriction).All this erratic behaviour has driven me to self despair. I want to bang my head against the wall and wring my own neck. I have emotional ups and downs. I lack motivation in all fields, from sex to exercise to reading. I fantasize about disordered behaviors. I have to fight these urges, amongst all my other urges constantly.I've tried everything. Diets, calorie counting, mindful eating. You name it, I've tried it. I am at the end of my rope. Please, tell me what to do. Please.
A family member who is now 26 was anorexic and in and out of treatment centers from 12 to 22. Since then she has suffered from binge eating, where she will stay up all night and just eat whatever is in the fridge. She also won't leave the house after she is at a certain weight because she doesn't want anyone to see her. She has been to several treatment centers to try to help with the binge eating, but nothing seems to be effective. She might have a good week, but she always goes back to binging. She has held a few jobs, but says that all she thinks about all day is eating. We are trying to figure out other options for her... One option is she could apply for disability and then have a live-in caregiver to keep her from overeating at night. Right now she is at her parents house, and they basically can't keep any food in the house. If anyone has any thoughts on how to handle this, it would be greatly appreciated!
I have a good friend of mine who struggles with a pretty serious Eating Disorder, and i am just trying to understand how she thinks with her weight so i can help her out when she comes to me with concerns about said weight.You see she the other day, she was telling me how much weight she has lost since Christmas, which was something scary, and she said it as if she was worried she had lost so much, as she was already very thin before Christmas.However last night she came to me and said she had put some weight over the past 2 weeks and said she was angry at her body for putting the weight on?I understand that it is a constant back and forth fight and although she constantly wants to eat and indulge herself in everything that will help her gain weight, she feels guilty for doing so.I guess what i am struggling to understand is, what is her thought pattern there?Why is she angry at herself for putting on weight but also upset with loosing so much weight at the same time? and how do i react to this thought process so i can help her here?    Concerned Friend
I have a friend, I'll call Emily, whom I care greatly about that I found out believes she has bulimia. She has admitted to purging on occasion and sometimes just does not eat. I'm very concerned with this especially due to the fact that she has Type 2 Diabetes. To me, these two illnesses together seem like they could be a ticking time bomb if she is not treated for bulimia.The problem is, Emily does not want to tell anyone. She lives with her mother, and her mother is not very supportive about mental disorders. Emily's brother self injured himself in the past, and when Emily's mother found out, she ridiculed him and told people what he did instead of taking a healthy step to help her son.I do not want to betray Emily's confidence in me, but it is my firm belief she is in desperate need to see a doctor about her eating disorder. She is only 17 years old, so is still fully connected with her mother's insurance. I'm really looking for some tips where I can help Emily see a doctor and get professional help without her mother finding out about Emily's problem.Thank you so much for any advice you can provide Reddit
I'm a vegan teenage female with a healthy weight and I eat a healthy amount.However, I do have quite an unhealthy relationship with food. Even I eat very healthily (almost completely veggies, grains, and fruits), but I still worry if I eat too many calories.I go through phases of counting calories in things like myfitnesspal or Cron-o-meter and restrict. After a while, I'll tell myself that I shouldn't view food like this, and I'll stop counting calories for a while.The problem is that since I've been counting calories for such a long time, I pretty much know the calories in most foods, and still worry about it. Eventually, if I gain a pound or two, I'll start logging calories again, and the cycle continues. I want to be able to eat without constantly worrying about it.tl'dr I want to know how you guys stopped counting calories. And even if you still count them, how not to worry about it.

Lost a great deal of weight in 7 months and need help.At my heaviest, when I came forward people laughed at me. Just a chubby white kid.I then lost a lot of weight, by not eating. I'm concernedIs Male Anorexia real? What do I do?
My girlfriend has a long history of struggling with body image and she understands that her habit is unhealthy.Before we had met, she had seen therapists in the past but she still is living underweight. I've tried talking with her about it and she has said she thinks it's an issue of control.I love her and I fear for her well-being, but I don't want to make things worse. I'm trying to use words like being healthy and reinforce the fact that I love and support her. What all can I do? She says she is doing alright, but I haven't seen any sign of progress. How can I help and encourage her towards recovery? Thanks!!
I've had an ED since I was 13 (now 24), and have mostly stopped all behaviors. I have recently gained weight through over eating because of trying to avoid thinking about food at all.I am now overweight and it's causing me some difficulty emotionally and physically, I don't feel healthy.I want to lose weight, but do it without re-triggering behaviors. How do I go about this? I've asked for help from my doctor, but I don't qualify for any help because of not being underweight.
I'm 24, struggled with BN for nearly 4 years, but I've been purge-free for almost nine months now. When I was purging regularly, I used to get a lot of burst blood vessels in and around my eyes, very red and bloodshot.Since stopping purging, though, I've noticed I still have a few lingering bright red veins in the whites of my eyes. It's not painful or affecting my vision, so I doubt it's anything serious, but I'm just extremely curious if this is a known or common phenomenon?I am wondering if anyone has had any similar experience with this happening? Is it permanent? Or is it likely unrelated? 
Been dealing with this for a while now. Have one or two week phases when I will not binge and it feels great, but at some point have reverted back to my old ways and find myself stuck in the same old patterns.Just wondered if anybody has been successful in dealing with BED? Share your stories and actions you've taken to help you recover, whether it was therapy or self-help books etc.
I have been in recovery for about a year and a half. I sometimes still struggle with random days where I have low confidence and I restrict or at least consider it, but 99 percent of the time, I eat a healthy amount.However, I've noticed that I still have some odd habits that formed while I had my ED that I just can't shake. I don't like to eat in front of others if I'm the only one eating, I don't like to be first or last to finish my food, I have to cut my meat a certain way, etc.Do these things ever go away?
I've been recovering for 2 years now; I eat fairly normally albeit less than average people. My immune system is a major issue though... I am literally sick every other week with something new. Pneumonia, upper resp infection, strep, flu.... it's always something. My workplace has been less and less forgiving. I had to stop going to the doctor recently because I ran out of money, so I have to ride out whatever it may be (except for when I had a 104+ fever). I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE. When did your immune system return? Will it ever?
After a fairly long and terrible period of denial, I'm seeking treatment for my eating disorder. I downplayed it for a long time, but I was assessed last week and diagnosed with bulimia, which means I no longer have the option of pretending that this isn't real.I've put my husband through hell with this - he's a therapist himself and hates that he doesn't know how to help me. Can anyone recommend some good books for spouses/partners of ED patients? My treatment center offers family therapy and he plans to do it, but I'd like to get some supplemental materials for him. This is a really shitty time, so I appreciate the help.
I have a really restrictive diet and possibly an ED.I'm well within the underweight range. I've lost my period, my hair comes out in chunks and now I temporarily lose vision every single time I stand.I want to develop a healthier and more positive relationship with food and I'm not sure where to start. Problem is I haven't snapped out of my narcissistic self image based mindset as of yet: I don't want to look any different as of yet. I just want to not feel like I'm dying.Does anyone have any suggestions? Any ideas on how to healthily and slowly eat more to a moderate amount?How can I overcome my body image issues? How can I find self-worth not dependent on body image.
I've always had issues with my weight and definitely binge eat.  I will be good for awhile and then binge until I feel physically sick.  I've always assumed that I just had an issue with food.  During my last relationship I had a some very rough moments where I found myself self harming (cutting) as a way to deal.  I couldn't figure out why this was suddenly an outlet for me in my 30's as I'd never self harmed before.  When I thought about it further, it struck me that maybe the binge eating had been my way of self harming before this.  If I'm dieting I almost enjoy getting super hungry and making myself endure it, and when I'm binging it's in an almost hateful way, like it's physically and emotionally painful but I force myself to endure it.  Is this a thing?  Can an eating disorder be a form of self harming and if so is it better to seek treatment for the binging or treatment for self harming?
Hi all, I'm posting on this subreddit because I've been going through a tough time recently and I'm wondering if I could possibly have an ED.I've been slim/skinny my entire life but never had a good body image, went to college and gained some weight - enough to push me into the 'normal' category of bodies instead of 'slim/lean'. It's been a 6-month struggle of self-loathing ever since, with calorie restricting and religious exercising 6 days a week. I've seen some results (but not enough) and I don't feel much better about my body. The thing is, I practically depend on exercising now to 'justify' calories that I eat - I feel terribly, horrendously guilty if I don't exercise and/or eat more than my 'allotted' amount of calories. I have a heart rate monitor as well, and push myself to burn 'more' calories each time.I've recently sprained my ankle, and the fear/guilt at not being able to exercise at all for several weeks is overwhelming. Couple this with some rather insensitive comments that relatives made about my gaining weight in college that triggered my self-loathing big time again, and it's pretty much led to me holing up in my room. I even avoid outings with my friends so that I won't be tempted to consume more calories in the form of food/alcohol, especially now when I can't exercise.I can't quite find the words to express how angry I am at myself for not being able to exercise and how I can't control myself around food. It's as if the past half-year of restrictive eating has driven my body into a feeding frenzy. At the same time, there's so little information about anorexia athletica out there, and I don't seem to have the classic symptoms of AN or bulimia. Can anyone offer some advice?
Traveling to the beach in a few weeks for a weekend trip with some good friends. Although one of them is my SO (who knows about my issues with extreme calorie cutting and exercising as well as a past history of purging), the rest I don't feel comfortable with knowing about my struggles.Maintaining normalcy during meals and regular events will be difficult enough, but actually making a beach trip is a different thing entirely. I'm on the low end of average weight and build for my height, and I'm at the point where intuitively I understand that I'm healthy and a bathing suit shouldn't be an issue. I'm just too repulsed by myself in a swimsuit to want to wear one in public, but i also can't exactly wear a shirt and pants to swim in. Has anyone else been in a similar situation / have any suggestions of how I can control my eating during the trip? I suppose it sounds silly, but when I'm fighting so hard to get this ED under control, the beach just sounds like one more giant hurdle. 
I'm currently recovering from bulimia. I have not binged/purged in 3.5 months. Although it happens significantly less often, I still have moments where I want to binge and purge. I don't expect these urges to be gone after only a few months, but it made me curious how long it took others, if at all, to not experience wanting to act on their eating disorder. Sometimes, I feel disheartened that I still have these urges when I know recovery is best for me. I guess I just want some confirmation that there is light at the end of the tunnel.

I am a teenage male who would like some AN advice.I have been diagnosed with AN, and I feel like I need a boost to achieve a healthier weight. I enjoy exercise and the foods I prefer tend to be low calorie, such as vegetables and fruits, smoothies and protein shakes. I barely enjoy other foods. Since I have such a small drive to eat, I feel I need to force myself to. I fear I would become bulimic if I do that, which I do not want all.  I just keep dropping weight. I have no idea what to do, as I have become very depressed and self-conscious. Even though I feel healthy, I get weak, dizzy, and have spells causing me to lose all sense of balance and collapse. I need advice.
I have been in a cycle of yo-yo dieting my entire life. I will have some motivating factor (tropical vacation, wedding, etc.) that will give me motivation to diet/exercise, but then once that passes, I try to rely on hunger cues which puts me right back at constantly overeating and obsessing about food.I almost always eat until I'm very full, and while I'm not eating I'm counting down the minutes until it would be somewhat normal to eat again. I don't want to think about food forever. I just want to lose all of this fat and then maintain a normal weight without obsessing about food. I want to actually be able to have a normal life.I recently did a bodyfat test at a gym and I'm not happy with the result, and in the past, my cholesterol has been high when I've had extra weight on. This is the heaviest I've ever been. My doctor has done tons of tests on me to figure out why I'm always "hungry" and he says I have no physical issues which would cause this, which makes me think it's a mental issue. My insurance doesn't cover mental health, however, and $100+/session is not something I can afford.Can anyone help me?
I have been overweight during most of my life. I'm 22 at the moment, and little by little I've been fixing that. Eating healthier and working out at the gym is how I'm achieving my goals, and I can see results. However, these results are barely noticeable over time because I have at least 1 binge episode a week. I'm not hungry, I don't even particularly enjoy the food that I'm about to eat, but I can't stop. Sometimes I buy something from the vendors on my way home, or on the convenience store between classes. Working part time at a restaurant doesn't help either, because I am free to eat anytime whatever I want.I am aware that I have a problem. I am sabotaging my own effort by not being able to control my eating. I carefully crafted a meal plan that provides me enough nutrients to work out, but I still feel that i NEED to eat -note, I'm not hungry-. I am currently living in South Korea, and if any of you doesn't know too much about the perspective korean society has of mental and psychological issues, they are considered somewhat a tabu. Finding counselours or therapists is almost impossible, and most of them are linked to a religion. Also, the language barrier makes it harder to effectively communicate one's troubles.I've been trying to see my school counselor, and while I appreciate her help, I don't think these sessions are being really useful. Most of the time she just listens and nods. Listens and nods, and tells me she understands. 5 sessions so far in the last 3 weeks. After reading some articles people shared on other subreddits I suggested that we try and discover the root of my problems, why do I do it? She nods and agrees, but goes to repeat the same cycle. I am not sure of her qualifications, and I'm sure that she empathizes with my situation, but that's not the reason why I'm looking for a counselor. I need help. Any advice?Thanks
I am recovering from an eating disorder, and during the process I have created noticeable stretch marks. They are mostly on my legs.I break down into tears every time I look at them and think about what this summer is going to be like. I won't be able to wear shorts, or go to the beach... not without wanting to cry every time someone looks at me. I don't have the confidence to walk around like this. This whole ordeal is making me slip back into my disorder and I'm terrified.To get to the point: what can I do? How am I supposed to handle this mentally? It's like I worked so fucking hard to learn to accept myself at a healthy weight, and then this happens and I have never been so disgusted by myself. I now see myself as fat because that I have stretch marks, and even if I lost weight again, they will still be there to remind me.Has anyone had any experience at all in regards to stretch marks during recovery? I honestly don't know how I am going to handle this.
Like many of the posts on here, I am dating a perfect girl despite her struggle with a binge/purge ED.  She has been working at this for a few years with professional help and has her ups and downs and lately she has had more ups than downs, but just tonight she told me about a new diet that she is dead set to try (I don't know if I can say it on here or not, let me know if I can). She was eating healthy and working out at a reasonable rate and was losing weight, but not fast enough, according to her. She was most upset because I hadn't noticed enough to say anything. In hindsight, I suppose I am an idiot for knowing that she was working hard and I didn't affirm it, although I did praise her work ethic and how drive to do things in a healthy manner. She has a deeply rooted issue with overdoing it at the gym and taking laxatives, and has basically stopped that, but she will occasionally slip back into those habits. She claims that I am a huge help with body confidence and so on and that she would rather talk to me than her counselor, but I feel like I'm watching my best friend drown and I don't know how to swim. I do not feel as if I am fully equipped to be her go-to, but I am honored that she feels she can feels she can confide in me. I don't want to make this about me, but it hurts me a terrible amount to see her go through this and know that I can't put an end to it with the snap of a finger. I guess what I am looking for is: A) more/better ways to help her, B) whether her new diet will be healthy, and C) a virtual ear to hear me, because she doesn't exactly want my friends to know, so I don't really have anyone to turn to. 
My doctor referred me to a cardiologist for possible LQTS. Of course, nothing else has been ruled out yet but I mentioned shortness of breath and dizzy spells and that's where I'm assuming LQTS comes into play. From what I understand it's largely genetic but most of my family is healthy.What did the first appointment with a cardiologist go like, and how does it affect your life now? I've read into it but am trying not to get too scared. Honesty is still appreciated, though. 
So basically my boyfriend tried to give me a compliment for my body but it ended up with him telling me that he has seen persons with better some features than me. Later on he told me I misunderstood him.It's not like im trying to forbid him to find other people more attractive, but I do not want to hear about it at this point in my life. For me this was absolutely soul crushing. I got really sad, and now I cant get over it. I cant do nothing but feeling a great urge to hide my body, and start with this unhealthy pattern again. All I think about is this and I don't know what to do. I had come quite a long way in recovery, but now I'm at square one again.How can I get over this missaying and deal with this in the future?
25yo guy here. About this time last year, I was in a hugely stressful job and started drinking heavily every weekend to cope. That had side effects in terrible hookups. I decided to sort my life out.After I'd quit my job and had been unemployed for a couple of months, I took up Thai boxing. It was great for stress relief and helped me sleep better. I avoided a lot of the depression that would have come with unemployment and the dieting and stress relief stopped me drinking.I was bullied for being a fat kid when I was younger. The other thing was that I grew up in a conservative Christian home. I lost my faith a few years back, but I always had trouble caring about my body. The only thing that really mattered was my relationship with God and so external health was a bit of a side pursuit.I'm a keen cook, and so it's easy for me to know how much is in everything I make. I lost weight and am aware what goes into my mouth and read the calorie information from everything else.When I started I was way above my correct weight category. In the last month I've been about right. I could be less. I'm basically trim, but not ripped. I'm very much a beginner though, so minor weight losses are nowhere near as important as getting technique right. Frankly I could be a higher weight and I'd be fine.What's started happening is that I diet over half the week, and then I'll eat way over. Then, I work hard the to undo the damage. But the main thing is I just obsess about food.I just want to be my weight and not think about it. I put on one pound and I'm a failure. I'm scared of going on holiday, going out midweek. Whenever I eat with friends I tend to overeat.I've been in my job for about 6 months now. It's in a different city and I haven't met nearly as many people as I'd hoped. I'm tremendously lonely and last month I had a huge argument with my father for unrelated reasons and I've just started to feel incredibly isolated.I want to spend more time on other things, but if I eat too much in a day, I have to go to the gym. If I meet up with friends, I'll get upset if we drive anywhere. I'll purposefully walk long pointless routes everywhere I go to burn calories.I thought this was the best place to ask about how to be sensible.How do I accept my weight and regular fluctuations in it?How do I not obsess on food?How can I not be upset going out to eat with friends?
We've had a long, bumpy right, but let me first say it's been positive and marvelous. She's recently been hospitalized, and I wish to be as helpful as her family has been to her, but there's certain "boyfriend" questions that always get me. In particular, now that she's in inpatient, she's asking if I can tell if she's gained.Of course, she has, and I can tell simply by how much healthier she looks in her face and hands, but any direction I take is a pitfall, because I can't dodge her wanting a simple 'yes' or 'no' response. What is the best response?
I am a 20 year old male who have had a turbulent last few years. I don't want to go into detail, because that's a whole other story, but for a short summary so you know what it's about.Three years ago I had surgery to correct a nerve condition in my arms. This had hindered me to work out for almost a year by the time I had the surgery, and has prevented me from working out full ever since. Before I the problems started, I was going into elite training for sprinting. I worked out at least 6 times a week and held a good diet. I was very healthy, apart from that nerve condition.However, ever since I wasn't able to work out "properly" I've been having pretty big body image issues. Since I can't work out to get the body I really want to have, I've been struggling to accept the body I have now and "settle" so to speak. The ways I see myself in the mirror vary a lot, sometimes I see a skinny-fat nerd, sometimes an athletic runner. This messes with my selfworth and also with my approach to food.I tell myself I eat healthy. I don't eat candy, cakes, muffins or anything like that, I don't drink soda and I stay away from fast food. I always eat a big breakfast, but I think that's mostly out of habit nowadays, since that's something I've always done. The kicker is my unwillingness to eat lunch and dinner.I hate feeling hungry, but not more than I hate feeling really full. I also get really guilt-tripped by myself if I eat big meals when I haven't "earned" them, like having worked out before. This has become a big problem now, because in my current place of living, I can't work out as often as I really need to. I do get out, but not as often as I need to feel I deserve to eat.So far, this hasn't stopped me for eating my proper share of food per day (I think), but the guilt has been towering, and culminated the other day when I almost threw out a whole meal when I got the notice that my soccer practice that evening got cancelled.I haven't talked to anyone about these feelings of guilt with anyone, and I am sure that to an outsider (and to my roommates) it would seem that I eat and feel just fine. But the truth is, I don't, and I'm worried this might escalate if I don't do something about it. But I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice or any similiar experiences? Anyways, thanks for reading, and I hope you all have a wonderful day.

It all began about 1 year ago, when I started paying attention to what i was eating, like counting calories, stopped eating cheese, pasta, bread, eggs, etc. I lost weight very fast. After a while it became more and more difficult to keep track so i started cheating but doing more exercise the day after instead of making myself vomit. Then it all went down when i tried to throw out. It looked so easy to me! I could eat whatever I wanted and all i would have to do was to purge. That way, i wouldn't feel bad and all my efforts wouldn't be ruined. Lately I've decided that it was enough, that I could not spend my life having this weird/disgusting/love-hate relation with food. I tried to get out since by eating normally, reintroducing forbidden food in my diet and most of all, stop purging. But it became worse!! I've gain so much weight cause i don't feel satiety anymore. And i just binge all the time, like literally eating non stop, i can't control myself.Can anyone give advice on how to stop this? I need help!!!(sorry for the mistakes i am not a anglophone)
Hey, I posted this in the relationship subreddit too, wanted to post here and get opinions from those who have first hand experience.So I've been seeing this girl for a few weeks now, things have been going pretty well, she is amazing! She told me she has bulimia, she feels fat and horrible when she eats and she purges it afterwards. She tells me she's getting help for it which is great! I wanna know how, as her boyfriend I can help her through everything. I love the girl so much and I'll do anything to make her happy. I have been telling her how much I care about her and how beautiful I think she is (and mean it!) and I'm doing what I can think of to be really supportive but sometimes I seem to screw up. Today she found herself having to eat in front of a bunch of people and she was really uncomfortable with it. She texted me that she wanted to purge and how she felt fat and I told her not to feel pressured and just to eat as much as she could without wanting to purge it afterwards and she did, afterwards I asked her if she ended up purging and she said "no" and I told her I was so proud of her but I accidentally pissed her off by asking. I didn't realize that was something I wasn't supposed to ask, I was trying to be supportive. Now she's mad at me, I don't want to keep accidentally making her upset. What are things to be aware of and that I should/ shouldn't do to be a good boyfriend and help her without accidentally offending her? tl;dr My GF is bulimic, I don't know how to be supportive besides usual Boyfriend stuff, I accidentally offended her. What should I do in the future to be better for her?
...and pretty much *only* at my parents' house. When I come home from college for weekends or holidays, I find myself binging on cereal and hating myself for it. It's always cereal. It's always at my parents' house. They're supporting three kids (besides myself), so I can't ask them to just stop buying cereal, and I can't *not* visit them over holidays. I struggled with (and continue to struggle with) anorexia, and after several months of treatment (which my mother arranged for me) I was released back into normal society. Now, however, she doesn't seem to notice that all of the cereal in the house vanishes when I come over. She just says it's "healthy" that I'm eating again. But it's not healthy. I eat until I'm sick and disgusted with myself. I don't even know why. I look at these bags of cereal and think, "This stuff isn't even that great," and I eat it anyway. It's always at home. It's always when I'm bored as hell and alone while everyone is at school (everyone is either a student or a member of the local school staff). Please help me. My mother is blind, my stepdad is ignorant, and my siblings don't understand. How can I get passed this?Thank you,-J
Hey, I'm not sure if I specifically have AN, but I've been underweight for a little under a year and have been carefully watching everything I put in my body.Anyways, the good news is that I'm finally starting to reintroduce a wider variety of foods into my daily life, including ones that I thought of as "junk" foods. The bad news, however, is that some of these foods still cause me anxiety. Just this night, for instance, I purposefully ate something that caused me anxiety, and I immediately proceeded to start strength training exercises afterwards (muscle, not endurance/aerobic). I'm already strength training twice a week for about 20-30 minutes each, but I always seem to add an extra exercise on the days I eat these foods.Should I be OK with my current twice a week program and just remind myself that it's OK to eat these foods, should I focus on the quality of my food more, should I train more frequently, or should I plan to eat these foods only on the days where I'm lifting?I can't seem to shake my anxieties over these foods. I've dropped most heavy cardio, so I don't think this qualifies as purging. But I want to make sure I'm following a healthy path.
I went to a GP after literally years of not seeing one. I saw one about 4 years ago when I was getting ready to go to treatment and since then everything has been done with my psych. I have been absent from all doctors (including my psych) for almost a year due to a lack of health insurance. I was recently eligible for insurance again, so I went to a GP because I need referrals (all those dealing with this kind of insurance in the States get me). When I was diagnosed, I was an ED-NOS special snowflake, which under the new DSM would just be bulimic. One of the many ways I purged was using laxatives, but not to the point where I am dependent on them (I know some of my treatment buddies have to use them on a regular basis).My GP hears about my, to put this nicely, occasional irregularity, and tries to prescribe me a laxative. I told her no, and explained why. She didn't understand why I wouldn't want to have laxatives in my apartment. I mean, it's one thing to get it once, but to have a prescription bottle full of the stuff is just too much for me. I would rather just deal with it with natural ways (like fruit or something) than having that around. Like, I thought of it as like me being an alcoholic and my doctor saying, "eh, just keep a bottle of vodka around the house... you know, just in case."Does anyone else have trouble explaining to a GP their ED issues? This isn't the first time that I have experienced something like this in the general medical field, and I was just wondering if others have.

Hey! So I'm pretty sure I'm bulimic. It started with a diet that worked, but I gained all the weight back. Now I fast at least 2 days a week and I binge at least 2 days a week. It really sucks and also I'm slightly gaining weight which I totally hate.Anyways I'm going to see a gynecologist on friday, which I guess they can also work as a primary doctor? Anyways I have parents who I really don't want to know about this (TBH they're a huge part of the reason I'm like this anyways because they're abusive) so how would I find a therapist? Cuz my parents can't know? And even though I'm in high school our school counselor sucks (I'm not going into it but I'd rather have bulimia 5ever than see her again). So yea that's the main problem here.Cheers! I'm /u/winetes, please message me if you reply :)
Hello, I should start by saying that I've never been diagnosed with an ED, but I have an unhealthy relationship with food, that started in my childhood. I purge, binge, and do other unhealthy things, I also try to mantain a healthy diet.But lately, I've been acknowledging the fact that something's not right with my eating habits, and I should seek help.I've been to a nutritionist before, but this is the first time I visit one, and I'm going because I'm suspecting something's wrong with my eating habits.What should I expect from my first visit? Since I'm visiting as a patient who needs help with her unhealthy habits, instead of a patient who wants to lose weight and is overweight- supposing there's a difference-.Thanks!I also would like to say, to all of you who are in recovery, that you're stronger than you think you are, you're so much more than a number or someone's negative opinion. Don't let setbacks make you feel like a failure, you're amazing!
I am 31, a mother and a wife. I am over weight but not by a large scale, just heavier than I should be in order to be in the healthy BMI range..About 6 years ago I lost a significant amount of weight in just over a year. I became obsessed with food and dieting.Over the years, I have put some of that back on. I know how to eat healthily, I know about exercise but I get into these self destructive cycles where I will diet and exercise and start to see progress (feel and look better) but if I fall off the wagon by over eating one day, I will occasionally purge. I feel broken by relationship with food and calorie counting.I have always associated bulimia with making yourself sick after every meal. I do not do this. When I am not dieting, I don't eat with much moderation but when I am in a frame of mine where I am not dieting, I don't purge.When I keep food diaries I am borderline obsessed with everything that goes into my mouth and hate myself if I go over my deficit calories. If I do, I purge.Because I go through these two week cycles of "not caring" and then dieting to undo the damage which sometimes involves purging, I stay the same weight. I can't break the cycle. I just want to be an a "normal" BMI and eat in moderation.I really want to lose this extra weight but I don't know what to do. I am mortified by my behaviour. No other human being in my life knows this. There is no way I can tell my husband or talk to a doctor. I have tried to will power myself out of this cycle but I keep failing and it is exhausting. I don't even know if I have an ED or what to make of all this. How do I get a handle on this?
I've always known I've had eating issues, and a disorder. In fact, I have accurately self diagnosed it seems. I've been struggling since I was 13. I was recently diagnosed with Atypical Anorexia Nervosa. I self diagnosed that previously (hence why I said I was correct). So...why is it hitting me so difficultly? Why are all my restrictive habits/thoughts in OVERDRIVE since diagnosis?How do you deal with the reality of a diagnosis when it is something you've already known yourself?
I have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I do have a tendency to binge. I'm also in the middle of a bad bout with depression.It doesn't happen every time, but when I'm making something for me to eat and my boyfriend asks me what I'm making, it strikes a nerve. I just want to scream at him "Food! I'm making food! You aren't going to eat it anyway, so why does it even matter what I'm making!?" He asks me what I'm making so much that it makes me feel guilty that I'm eating at all. I know he doesn't mean to make me feel this way, but I do. I don't exactly know why. Is this a symptom of a disorder, depression, or just something that I need to learn to deal with?I have talked to him about it, but it usually ends up with me being angry, and things don't change anyway. He just continues to ask me what I'm making. I don't really know what to do about this. I don't even know if this feeling is common. Honestly, I don't even know if I'm looking for advice, or sympathy, or someone to relate to. I guess mostly, I'm just looking for calm.
Hello there! I am currently living away from home to attend school in the PNW. Recently, several of my friends from back home have been talking about coming to visit me. Two sets of sisters will be flying up to stay with in April. The first pair will be coming the first week or so and the second should be arriving shortly after the first two go back to California. Obviously, I am really excited to see my loved ones and show them around the new place I have fallen in love with. However, I am really nervous on what meal times are going to look like and would really love some advice. All the friends who are coming to visit me know I have a history with ED so it's not like I have anything to hide but still. The first set of sisters are kind of triggering for me as it is seeing as they have a body type my ED finds very appealing and have very sporadic eating habits due to their extremely busy schedule of working nearly full time and putting themselves through community college. I don't know- I just feel like the pressure to eat out daily will be really anxiety producing for me and I am just really nervous on how to handle it. Does anybody have any advice? I hope I gave enough context to shed light on what's troubling me.Thank you and I wish you all the best!
It will be almost a month since i stopped binging and purging and I have noticed that I gained weight. It hasn't been significant, but enough to put me into a panic. I have been watching what I eat ever since I stopped B/Ping and logging the food I eat to keep track of my calories. I am trying not to obsess over my weight and have stopped weighing myself every morning to prevent myself from being dejected the whole day in case I have gained weight. I know this will be better for me in the long run and have decided to only weigh myself every 2 weeks to once a month so that I can get a better picture of my real progress. The question is; how can I keep myself from obsessing over my weight and continue with my new lifestyle? Also, is it normal to gain weight after being bulimic for so many years? Thank you in advance for any comments/suggestions you can offer.
I've just been diagnosed with BED and I was wondering if anyone could give me some information about the types of treatment available, tips for recovery, etc. My therapist said we would not be focusing on food at least for now (so no food journals and such), and I also don't want medication. Thanks!
After over 10 years without a purge, I slipped up last night and I worry about this becoming a habit. My husband is aware that I have bouts of anorexia, but was not aware that I also occasionally purged before meeting him.I've been trying to maintain a healthy weight and I am right in the middle of the BMI scale for healthy weight. I have a tendency to binge, but I normally just eat slightly less the next day. I remind myself that even a one night binge won't cause much weight gain. I've been on track. I have a math brain and so I work out the exact weight of the calories I consumed to show myself it's not a huge mistake.But last night, I was about to go the sleep, but my husband complained I was going to sleep 'too early' and woke me up. Being woken up, is a trigger for me to binge. And I did.So I asked him to please not wake me up again, because it causes me to eat food I really don't need. And he replied 'Well why don't you just throw it up then.' In a half joking, half annoyed that I complained manner.So I did. And I was so ashamed my myself. My daughter's bedroom and my stepson's room are right outside the bathroom. I'm sure they must've heard me vomiting. All for the sake of a few hundred calories.I went back into our bedroom and my husband said 'Did you just have a bath?' I shook my head no and he knew then. He said 'Why would you do that? I was only joking.' And I know he didn't know and didn't mean anything by it. But at that time, he suggested it and it seemed like a quick fix.I don't want to fall back into this bad habit. I don't want my daughters to notice, or to think this is a normal behaviour. I don't want to end up with bad teeth or a heart condition. I am setting ground rules for bedtime tonight and insist that I not be woken up unnecessarily. Do any of you have any insight into this? How do I stop binging? How do I make sure I don't get into this awful habit again?
From the around high school until my junior year of college, I had gradually worsened my eating habits into an EDNOS. I finally got help my junior year via therapy, but I was only in for a few months. I started on the right track to get better and my closest friends who knew and my SO have been supporting me immensely.I've just moved countries, and I'm trying to better myself. I eat three meals a day now (which I had a had time doing before), and I'll snack during the day too. I used to be at a lower weight for my body and still felt it was "too big". Now, I feel as though I'm gaining weight (I don't have a scale) which is healthy, and I'm exercising quite a bit, but I'm having a hard time coming to terms with how my body is looking now. Sitting down is the worst - I feel horrible about my body when I look at my stomach.How can I stop this? I want to feel better about myself, I want to get better, but it's hard when sitting down feels like it's triggering me.
I've noticed recently that I've been counting calories more than I should be, and trying to exercise to balance my day out. I'm obsessed with my intake and output, and I know that I am on a very slippery slope. I'm wondering if anyone has any tips to get out of this mindset? I am worried I am developing an eating disorder.
I consider myself healthy at this point and if I do relapse, it's only for a couple days and then I pick myself up again. I would like to start exercising/dieting in a healthy way though. Every time I consider counting calories the way they should be counted, a voice inside my mind tries to convince me to cheat and go lower than I should. The biggest aid in my recovery has been avoiding numbers (scales, calories, etc). How can I introduce those in a better light? What are ways I can stay in shape by avoiding as many number triggers as possible?
I have a bulimia and anorexia. I have been to the Emily Program (who are amazing) But I've fallen off the wagon again, I just ordered a dbt workbook. But am curious if anyone has read another book towards self help/recovering that has helped?
I haven't been able to eat around anyone but family for the last 8 years..idk why. It's always weighed on me but lately it's just killing me. I can't be normal or go visit my friends at college or dinner or restaurants with my family or anything. My sisters make fun of me because I only eat specific foods because It scares me to eat other things. I have been purging for the last 4 months or so, this isn't the first time...I was previously in therapy for the purging. It's gotten really bad lately and I don't know what to do or why I am this way. Any advice or people who are like me please help. There's obviously way more too this story, but I don't want to make it too long that's annoying. Thanks...
Hello, I have wasted 5 years of my life suffering from bulimia. I used to be a overweight girl, but when I was 13 I lost a lot of weight in a healthy way. I was still borderline overweight, and I was not pleased. I started restricting which lead to binging, so I gained weight instead of losing it. For a few years I accepted it and thought that once I'd be old enough I can join a gym and work on myself, but for the time being I will be satisfied with the progress I still managed to make.When I was 16 I was dating this guy who was very cruel to me and despite his constant remarks on my weight (and controlling my eating) I adored him like any love-struck teenager. In my obsessive need to please him, I experimented a few times with purging, but it was only on special occasions when overeating was unavoidable. Then when I was 17, post-break up, we had a lot of issues in my household that lead to regular binging and purging, yet still pretty under control. I had by then joined a gym and my weight was down to below my previous "borderline overweight" level, but not yet satisfied. When I turned 18 I gained control fairly well and started to actually live like a healthy human being, I was at my prime needless to say. I was in fit shape, I was happy and my weight was finally pleasing to me. I looked amazing and I loved my body so much, yet still I always wanted more. On Christmas that year I relapsed, and ever since then it has been a constant struggle. So technically, from year 2013 to this present day my binging and purging has been out of control, eating enormous amounts of food, more than ever before. There were times when I was able to quit for a few weeks but it always came down to other emotional distress that caused me to lose it again. Now I'm back to my "borderline overweight" level and I hate myself for it. It's so ironic that I know very well that if I just ate healthy like I used to, I'd be back down to a weight I'd be happy with. I am so angry at myself for letting this get so out of control. Now I'm living with an amazing boyfriend who loves me for who I am, but I am so overwhelmed with guilt as well as this "addiction" that I don't know how much longer I can take it.. I want to seek help, but at the same time I'm afraid. I want to believe that I can do this myself. Every time I try to quit, I get so anxious and being full is uncomfortable for me that I always end up relapsing. The evenings are always the hardest for me. This has had a huge negative impact on my social life, my studies and in general my quality of life. What am I to do? I feel trapped in myself...TLDR; Been struggling for 5 years with bulimia, I really want to nip it in the bud, but at the same time I'm conflicted about it.
A family member of mine is having serious problems as a result of an eating disorder. Nobody seems to get it and she is separating the consequences of the behavior on the body from the disorder. Would an intervention be the best thing to do? What could I do to break through and offer her help with this disorder?
Hi! I just wanted to post because I have a question. I have no history with eating disorders, but recently i haven't been able to stomach anything. I am a college student, and when I go to the dining hall and smell the food I get nauseous. I have only been able to eat certain foods like plain pasta. I looked up "food aversion" and it seems like it is for young children and pregnant women. I am neither. Does anyone have experience with this?
I'm really concerned, I'm 5'8" and underweight. I didn't really have any body image issues causing this, but get really stressed out and physically can't eat... I have to force myself to and it makes me sick, sometimes it makes me vomit. I don't even want my favorite foods. I'm now starting to have body issues because the things I liked about my body are pretty much gone and I'm just awkward and boney looking. I feel gross and am constantly weak and exhausted and it's starting to really trash my self esteem. I've had issues with not being able to eat before, but it's never gotten this serious. I've slowly but surely been loosing weight to the point where I'm currently underweight. I go to college out of state, and I'm not really sure what to do here.I really need to gain weight and I also want to. How can I start eating normally again when I feel stressed?
So I don't think my wife (late 20's, slightly over weight) has an eating disorder. But she exhibits behavior that I think could lead to one eventually if not addressed. She confesses to eating in secret and when she's feeling low she will binge eat. Yesterday she said "I binged pretty bad today. I'm so disgusted with myself I don't even want to tell you what I ate."I know she has addictive tendencies. She's been struggling to kick a pop habit for years. She managed to do it this summer for a few months. But last week she confessed to drinking 3+ every day and when she stopped she got slammed with a migraine so bad it kept her from going to a party she was really excited for.She will also buy me junk food so she can justify buying herself junk food too. Yesterday when I got home she said there was a pint of ice cream for me in the fridge and when I went to retrieve it it was sitting next to a pint for her. When she does this if I don't eat whatever she gets fast enough she'll end up eating it herself.She knows she has some issues with her relationship to food. But, and this is horrible to say, I don't think she's equipped to deal with them on her own. We don't get to spend huge amounts of time together because of our work and school schedules. So I can't be there to police her. I'm not sure what I can do to help nip this in the bud. I am hoping Reddit might have some advice on how to help her.
I am in my early/mid 20's and recently inquired about inpatient treatment and found out that, thanks to insurance, it would cost MUCH less than I had imagined. That is awesome news! However, I am wondering if inpatient treatment is right for me.I have worked in an inpatient facility so I am familiar with what treatment entails. I have also read enough to know that there are high rates of relapse after an inpatient stay. Research I have read indicates that outpatient (with family or support system) therapy is more successful. However, I am really interested in alternative therapies such as equine therapy and adventure therapy. I am so sick of being inside my head and really don't feel like spending more energy working through everything internally. I want to expend my emotional energy outwardly, if that makes sense...I want to try something different that is less "in my head". There are no outpatient treatments of this sort in my area, but there are some inpatient facilities that offer such treatments in other states.Here is the thing: My ED does not hinder my ability to function in society. I am in grad school and am doing well in my internship. I realize I do not have to be debilitated to enter inpatient treatment, but the fact that I am medically stable kind of adds to my hesitation.I have had body image issues since I was 13 and was overweight throughout most of my teenage years. I have had various ED behaviors for years, but I'd estimate that it has gotten much worse over the past year and a half or so. I am within my weight range but am not okay with it. I have ED behaviors that I engage in in private and what is displayed outwardly are behaviors that people unfamiliar with EDs would not recognize. I often eat in seclusion and will not eat a meal that is not planned at least 24 hours in advance. To do so causes extreme anxiety, panic, and guilt. I am OBSESSED with numbers. All of my time (aside from when I am at my internship or asleep) is spent planning meals or just looking over and over again at meals and re-reading the calories planned. I become paralyzed at the grocery store sometimes when deciding what to buy and end up settling for my "safe food". I could go on...but in a nutshell, I engage in behaviors and have obsessive ED thoughts.The only people who know about my ED are my best friend, my boyfriend, and my mom. I recently told my dad kind of on accident (but he knows very minimal details...only that I struggle with eating and body image). None of them understand the disorder and they do not know how much it affects me. My mom recently stated that I "...don't have eating disorder behaviors and just eat healthy and count calories". Part of me is glad that is all she sees, but I also wish she could understand how badly I hurt. At the same time, though, I really don't want to burden her. Or my boyfriend. They are supportive, though...at least as supportive as they know how to be.TL;DR: I would not enter treatment until August (after I graduate) and really, the likelihood of me entering inpatient treatment is slim. Despite the new knowledge that it would cost much less than I had anticipated, it is still not pocket change for me. I do not want to spend $$$ on treatment unless I am dedicated to recovery. It would be a waste to come back and not continue to put forth effort to recovering. I have several months to really think this over, but at this point, I am not sure I am dedicated to recovery. I am scared to let go of my ED, but at the same time, I am so sick of it. It is hell inside my head and it's a private hell...I would appreciate some input on whether or not you guys think inpatient treatment is right for me. Thanks!
I work for a company that has support staff who look over about 3-4 mentally disabled adults live more independently.We have one client in particular who suffers from bulimia. She is also diabetic and requires constant 24/7 care.However I feel like some of the things we do are not helping her, and instead making it worse for her.she cannot go to the bathroom unless supervised. Now she cannot take a shower without us looking at the curtain (via the mirror) to keep her from purging. However, none of us have adequate medical educational backgrounds or therapy backgrounds (I have the closest but am not certified nor, educated specifically for ED)She is constantly told what she cannot and can eat. she is constantly being monitored, punished for her behavior, and punished for purging. No one except for me; tries to talk to her and see how she feels.I'm just at a loss at what to do. I want to get the state more involved with her care because this company does not seem to handle it well. I feel like they want her to fail. I'm not sure what I can/should do in this situation.tl;dr: client suffers from ED and is being taken care of by staff not educated to help her.
Struggling a little bit over February, and was re-reading some books to help me through recovery. Some of them have mentioned having specific "mantras" or words to repeat during hard times; any one have any suggestions?
I've managed to cut back on my purging behaviour and stopped entirely for about 3 months but with the loss of a loved one it came back full force in recent weeks. Last night after a purge I felt my heart racing, skipping beats and then slowing. A 5 hour ER stay showed everything was normal so I just put myself into a panic with "this is the end" thinking.I have an appointment with my psychotherapist this week but this is the first time I'm telling her about my disordered eating.I'm hoping that last night was my last purge. I am so done with thinking I'm going to die from this. It doesn't even keep weight off anymore, anyway. I read through all these recovery suggestions that are posted but what is your very best one for recovery? Also how did your therapist react when you told them?I couldn't bring myself to tell the Doctor last night but I'm sure they figured it out.
I work in an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant. The girl in question is in her early to mid 20's, underweight, kind of unhealthy looking. She always comes in with her boyfriend who always speaks for her.She eats a large amount of food, more than almost anyone I've ever seen eat. She takes pretty regular bathroom breaks and usually comes out with tears in her eyes, which is what lead me to believe she is bulimic.I've considered confronting her boyfriend while she's in the bathroom, but I can't imagine it doing any good since he obviously supports it. Is there anything I can do? If you were her, would it help you for the restaurant to stop serving you? To call you out? 
Hi,I know I've messaged a few times for advice while I was coming to terms with my eating disorder resurfacing again after 7 years but I need a little guidance on going forward.I organised meeting with my university's eating disorder service, who recommended I get referred to the local NHS ED clinic (UK). After a doctor referral and weeks of waiting and assessments I've been declined help because they don't think I have an eating disorder.I'm trying not to let it get to me so I'm going to try to help myself. I'm tired of food ruling my life. I'd like to know if there are any other people who've managed to help themselves, and what you found really helped. Books, videos, websites etc to help with feelings of guilt, overcoming that critical voice in your head, and actually understanding what your body needs to eat to be healthy.Thank you for reading this, I'd really appreciate any advice anyone has.
When I started taking a medication used to treat bipolar disorder, Risperdal I gained a large amount of weight in a few short months.Two years later when my doctor reduced the dosage I started exercising and eating right and lost more than half of the initial weight I gained.I currently go in cycles. I will go a week of balanced eating and exercise then 3 days of intense binging. This has been going on for months and I haven't made any progress with my weight loss.I don't know what to do I just feel so helpless in my body. My doctor keeps telling me will power, but I just can't... Sometimes I have to give in, I can't stop myself. Please help.Can anyone give advice on what I should do?
I have been trying to find help for a while now with no luck, I thought maybe someone here might have had the same problem or be able to help.I think I have binge eating disorder, or exercise bulimia, or something else entirely. Basically I feel like the binging is the real problem, I do it 1 - 3 times a week but I never throw up. But after of course I feel guilty and horrible so I "get back on track" by "eating healthy" (really, restricting a lot) and exercising like crazy. This all inevitably leads to a binge and the cycle repeats. It's so horrible and I'm really depressed all the time and I can't stop.My problem is that it's hard to find OHIP (Canadian) covered treatment for binge eating disorder, and the places I have found actually have a BMI requirement to be eligible. My BMI is normal so I can't get treatment at these places. I'm not sure what to do anymore.Has anyone else had trouble with this? Does anyone have experience getting OHIP covered treatment for binge eating disorder? Has anyone ever even overcome binge eating!? Because at this point I feel like it's impossible.
I was wondering if anyone diagnosed with BED has been prescribed Vyvanse and what was your experience? Today my psychiatrist gave me the script. I'm feeling hopeful, but the thought of taking a stimulant is a little unsettling.
I'm doing a college project on mens anorexia. I would  love to get more feed back via  my survey. I am new to reddit. thank you https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FGRGCJL
I made a throwaway for this, because it could potentially affect my job. I'll give a little history first. I know it is a bit lengthy, but I sincerely am trying to get advice of some sort.I am Male, 23 years old. I had been overweight since around the 4th grade, age ~10. My parents would always just order pizza or take us to fast food. I would just eat whatever, whenever. I knew I was fat, it bothered me alot, I would be very upset with myself alot, but I never did anything about it. After high school, I diddy bopped around a bit but decided to join the Military. I changed my diet slightly, starved myself, would not drink anything, slightly worked out just enough to pass the initial weigh ins for MEPS processing. At boot camp, we had very regimented PT and diet (obviously, I know). I lost a ton of weight there and got to a good weight and BF%. Once out of boot camp, my problems began.These problems have been going on, in the forefront, for about 3 years now. They might have been going on for longer but I just hadn't noticed them. Ever since I lost a bunch of weight in boot camp, i absolutely dread putting it back on. I am absolutely not happy with my body right now even though I am at a good weight/BF%. Everyone tells me how I am looking great, but I am disgusted with myself. People tell me how I've never looked so good, and compared to my previous weight, I obviously appear much better. But that doesn't stop me from being disgusted with myself.I never swam when I was a teenager because I was embarrassed to take my shirt off. To this day, I am still embarrassed to do so. At work, we often take our blouses off and work in just our trousers and (tucked in) undershirts. I hate this and always put on a sweater if I take of my blouse since I feel like people are staring at my perceived gut.This ties into my biggest fear which is gaining weight again. I am absolutely terrified by this. I've been to Afghanistan. I remember being on combat patrols and being more concerned with how many calories I ate for the day than the people shooting at me. I would get annoyed because I would lose my train of thought and have to start my mental count over again. The patrols would get back to base and I would excuse myself to the head and make myself throw up the MRE snacks I ate while out on patrol. This problem is with me everywhere. Whether in country or at home. I will be home with my wife and just think about how disgusting I must look to her. I will eat dinner and make an excuse in order to take a shower so that the water will drown out the sound of me making myself throw up dinner.This brings up another problem I have. I absolutely cannot buy groceries. If I buy food, I practically cannot stop myself from eating it. By eating whatever I wanted, when ever I wanted, it is like it is carrying over. Bagels in the pantry? Well, I might as well eat them. I have to wait until I feel my stomach rumble, and then buy food. And only the amount I need to eat. If I get any more, I will eat it. It makes living with my wife very difficult. We are both military and we are stationed in 2 different states. I get to see her every other weekend or so. But when I get to visit her, I just feel like I can't help but to eat all of the groceries that she had bought. Then I fell disgust with myself for eating so much. Then I purge. My wife has almost caught on a few times but I keep making excuses. I am too embarrassed to tell her. I don't want to tell her and admit that she was right all along and that I've been hiding things from her.I try to eat healthy, but I will go to the store and I will break down and buy pizza. or oreos. Or chocolate. And I will devour it all. Why? Because I am in the store and I will literally think to myself, "Yes, I can get these. I'm just going to throw them up after I eat them anyway. So what does it matter?" It is a terrible repeating cycle.I go to the gym every day and work out. I obsess with trying to track calories. I will purge multiple times a day. I will take laxatives and the such to force myself to purge. IT comes in waves though. Sometimes I don't purge for a week or two. Sometimes I purge every day, multiple times a day. sometimes I take laxatives multiple times a week. I am writing this as I am making plans to purge the dinner I ate.I desperately want to get professional help, but I can't because of the military. I have to see a regular care provider, who can then recommend me to see a specialist, who may send me to a therapist. The problem is that the therapists and such are in the Mental Health department. I will be absolutely ridiculed at work, mercilessly. Not to mention the fact that I would have now seen a therapist which means I am on a watch list for further mental issues. Add that to the fact that Eating Disorders are grounds for Separation from the military. I would then have a AdminSep due to Mental Health reasons, which will follow me for the rest of my life. I am afraid of how this would affect me for my future in things like employment.I don't know what to do. I don't know how to make it stop.
Hi Reddit,Me and my girlfriend are both students, and she is currently relapsing badly back into what she has identified as an ED from her childhood. We both don't really have experience dealing with recovery or prevention, and because of some other factors getting help from a therapist at the moment isn't a possibility.Currently she has consistently been eating below a healthy amount to maintain her weight, which is already very low for her height, although the only symptoms shes had so far from undereating are dizziness and occasional fainting. Shes working incredibly hard planning out meals each day, but struggles as adding on enough calories to reach a healthy total makes it easier for the ED to take over and make her stop eating altogether that day. We're getting there slowly but steadily but I'm very worried that if she continues to under eat the health issues might get more severe before she manages to start eating a healthy amount consistently.Does anybody here have any experience with this kind of situation, and do you have any advice on how I can help her to add on calories and eat healthily without me triggering her? :) Ive read amazing responses on this subreddit and its incredibly assertive and supportive to hear so many stories of success.Thank you! :)
Forgive me if this post makes little sense. I'm trying to be as vague as possible as this is my first post here.For some context, I am 21 years old and I have struggled with these disorders since I was a kid. I was underweight for many years and after high school I "recovered", meaning I stopped restricting/purging. I of course gained a lot of weight. While I still struggled with my body image and I still practiced some bad habits, no one questioned whether I was sick anymore.I got married in August of last year and at that time I was considered slightly overweight. I struggled with that, of course. I was okay though, I was simply living and being happy. As the title says, I'm 25 weeks pregnant now and I actually weigh less than I did when I first became pregnant (in September) due to extreme and constant morning sickness. I eat when I'm hungry (and I'm not often) and I try so hard to eat things that I know will help my baby grow. But now those habits are resurfacing, even if in a different way. While I don't restrict myself, I am obsessing over what goes into my body. I would rather eat nothing but an apple and bowl of shredded wheat all day than eat something the stereotypical "unhealthy person" would eat, if that makes sense. I know it doesn't make sense, though. I'm trying to be healthy for my baby, completely to a fault. I'm afraid that this will evolve into a full-fledged eating disorder again.Has anyone been in my position? Please, give me any advice you have. It will be SO appreciated.TL;DR I was recovered mostly, became pregnant and began obsessing over food again. I need to be healthy for my baby but I'm afraid of developing a disorder.
Hello reddit, I am very new to reddit, so forgive me if I am somewhat bad at posting. My story starts when I was a Senior in high school. At the time I was studying and preparing for college and exams. But it was also during that time that I had my first real relationship. My ex boyfriend was an international student in his 2nd year of college, neither my family nor I thought that our relationship would last very long. He was going to leave in a year, but somehow because of me he decided to stay longer. I loved him, and thats probably hard for a lot of people to understand considering what he encouraged me to do. He was from a culture where skinny was everything. If you weren't skinny then you weren't beautiful. If you weren't skinny then you were a nobody. Unfortunately I wasn't. I never really was skinny growing up, and I really didn't let it get it me. But after dating him for a couple months, he started pushing me to eat less and exercise more. At first I thought he was just concerned for me health, but then one day he just blatantly told me that he told I was fat. Of course like most girls I was mad that he would say something so mean and hurtful. But then I went to his home country the summer I graduated high school, and I saw where he got his idea of beauty from. This sight, along with his consistent comments on my weight, pushed me to lose weight. I kept telling myself I would lose ten pounds and stop. Once I lost ten pounds I would try to lose another ten, then another ten, until I got to the point where I was skinny, but always sluggish and tired. I stopped eating and stopped exercising, because i just didn't have the energy to do so anymore. My family were all worried about me, but he was proud. Proud that his girlfriend was "beautiful" now. Eventually my mother told me that if I didn't start to eat, she would hospitalize me. So that's what I did. I ate and ate, and then threw it all up. I did this going all through college. Even after we broke up, I couldn't stop. I tried stopping so many times, but I don't know why I can't. Now I am with a great guy. He doesn't know this about me. But I really want to stop. Please reddit, can you give me some advice?

I got diagnosed with anorexia for about 5 years ago, and have since then gone through different phrases, both ups and downs. I quit treatment a short while after the got the diagnosis. Over the last years I've had more tendencies towards bulimia and I've also gained a lot of weight. I've been off and on recovering by myself for a couple a years, but the longest time I think I've managed to pull off without a b/p is x weeks. My family knows about my situation, and when an situation occurs the response is usually anger (I don't blame them though, also, they have been in family counselling.). But I also feel frustrated that my mom doesn't do anything for helping me. How can i seek her help more? (I'm not even sure if it's possible to get more help. Also, we can't afford any treatment places etc.)I've tried rooting out my triggers but I can't seem to find them. Mainly it seems like stress, but also being at home. (I'm currently living at my mom, as i'm 16. Also my mom is always asking me after meals about "how many calories was in that? etc, because she have started calculated all of her meals and is always informing me about it. which is really triggering) Maybe it's because i find my family situation stressful. (The days I'm not home until eight is usually the days I don't binge.. but i can't do this everyday.)Is it ACTUALLY possible to recover?How can i seek more help from my mom regarding helping me recovering from bulimia? 
I'm currently being treated in an inpatient care facility against my will. I do wish to get better and I understand that my condition is serious. But I wish to get help in the outpatient care instead.I got where I am right now by seeking that help, but since my physical condition was so severe, right there and then, they chose to put me in here.How do I deal with the anger I feel? I feel like I have not been heard since they don't believe that I want help, but would prefer to be able to live at home. I am also being told that I would not be able to do it on the outside. Something I object to. I have the motivation to do it. The will.I grew up with a sister with anorexia and later on bulimia and feel very uneasy around others with the diagnosis. I feel triggered all the time, both because of the horrible years with my sister's problems, but also because I, like many others, compare myself to the others patients all the time. I feel like I will only get more difficult thoughts and have my behaviour around food worsened.How should I think about all of this to be able to cope and not let the anger and angst get the better of me?I am diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (binge/purge type).
Everything triggers me. hearing people mention weight, sizes, calories, seeing people thinner, everything. How can I deal with this in a positive way and avoid a relapse?
Hi /r/EatingDisorders -- I'm writing for some feedback from other people -- how do you bring this up to a new s/o. I have been seeing someone for about 2 months, and have come close to telling him about my history/current struggles with bulimia... but couldn't quite get it out. to be perfectly honest, i am scared about his reaction. (My last boyfriend was aware of, and very supportive of my recovery most of the time, but got so angry with me when i back slipped, as if i were doing it to spite him...... it wasn't helpful at all, and made me very guarded about letting anyone else know, for fear of an angry reaction. Its so hard to explain to other people who have never been through it themselves)in this new relationship, i have been completely honest with him about EVERYTHING, except this. I feel like i may be lying by omission with this one, since its a doozy...how long have you given a relationship before letting someone in on your ED struggles?xx thanks for your help.
I was wondering if anorexia is considered suicidal behavior. Someone very close to me, but much older is suffering. She is getting worse and worse and I can see that the disorder is linked to depression. I am depressed myself and i am familiar with obsessive weight loss, but not to such an extent. This lady is incredible and such a wonderful person and she told me about her problem. seeing a therapist doesn't always help and I can imagine she feels even more alone than I do. I just want her to live regardless of the pain she's feeling but i'm not sure. the weight of this world is a lot to bear. I can't be helpful because i'm just a dumb 20 year old and i'm crazy. So when she starts talking about death i start to panic. I am so worried. I was wondering if there is anything i can do. like i'm not going to send her to a psychiatric ward, that place is awful and causes more problems than anything else. But i want her to live i just want her to live. Is that selfish? i just love her and i'm confused. 
So my situation is that I know the "root cause" is probably my abusive parents. But there's really not much I can do about it until I go off to college in five months. IDK if it's even possible to get over my ED when I can do nothing about the "deeper issues" so to say.
My girlfriend has EDNOS. I fell madly in love with my girlfriend more than a year ago. We have been through and incredible amount together, and I don't want to spend a moment without her. I'm looking for advice on what I can do to make everything better. Her parents and friends in school do not know about this, and she is mortified that anyone will find out. We have had talks about going to see a specialist, or even just a regular therapist to talk through some of it but she doesn't want to talk with anyone else. She is at a healthy weight but struggles almost every day getting down food that isn't enough. Over the past few months I have been doing some research on it all, searching for things such as "How to help your girlfriend with an eating disorder" and "Eating disorder self-recovery". I have found lots of good ideas and tips of sorts, but I am looking for some more personal advice. I want to help make everything better, and I am terrified that I will fail at it.Does anyone have advice on how else I can help her?
I was recently put on seroquel to help with my suicidal depression. It's actually working (most meds don't) and it's also helping to force me to take in a decent amount of calories because it causes increased appetite. The problem I'm having now is that I'm upping my exercise out of guilt but it's to an unhealthy extent. I have this thing where I think I can feel the fat growing on my hips and arms after I eat, in my mind I can see it. It's actually starting to not feel as bad now that I'm on the new med but it's still there and I can't keep working out till I throw up just to ease the guilt from eating a normal meal. That's not a good long term solution.I tried googling it but that wasn't very helpful. What other ways can I deal with the guilt of eating an adequate amount of calories?Oh and I should probably mention I'm trying to lose some (more) weight. That's how all this started again. That's how it always starts.
My sister is battling Anorexia.  She's started screening my phone calls.  I am too messed up to jump in to the fray again or fly a thousand miles to check up on her.  I can tell it's bad because this is the behavior she does when she relapses.I am tempted to send an honest email to her about how the family loves her but thoughts won't make her well,  etc.  I am pretty fed up and while I will be there for her always, I can't try and intercede in her life.  Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  How does a brother wade through all of this? As an aside, my parents are basically broke and can't afford to send her to treatment again.  If she doesn't step up then she'll be in the hospital again.
Well I started dating a girl I am in love with now. She's been dealing with bulimia for longer than we've been dating and only in the past year has accepted it for the problem it is. The only thing is she's afraid to get help for it because of fear or what her family and friends will say, I assume. It seemed as if it had been getting better in the past month, but now for some reason it seems to be getting bad again. She's extremely smart but she can't seem to find away to bring herself to seek professional help. I just want to know if anyone had any ideas, or tips on what I can do as her boyfriend to help convince her to get the help to needs. Or if not just things I can do to maybe help her a day by day. I know it's something that she has to deal with in her own mind and things I do help very little if at all. (e.g. like me telling her she's beautiful and that I love her) I love her very much and just want her to get better because I know she's suffering with this illness. How can I do my best to support her, encourage her to get help, and help her get well in her recovery?
Any advice on how to improve my relationship while in recovery? My boyfriend of two years has been super helpful and goes to counseling with me, but I still feel like the disordered/negative thoughts still get in the way? How can I keep the relationship strong throughout this process?
A very close friend of mine is troubled by depression and a crippling negative view of their body. After a history of anorexia, self depreciation and being incredibly withdrawn they confided their present fears to me not so long ago; struggling with how they look & feel, and being tempted to slip back into their anorexic tendencies.Being a very close friend of mine I've let it known many times that not only do I adore them, but that I am there for them if they ever need me. I myself do have some experience with depression, however in this case, being on the other side of the fence, I am unsure how to advise & proceed. I appreciate that they need professional help which they're currently receiving but my question is simply how can I help?Having thought about it I may be making the incorrect assumption that they even want my advice. Perhaps they're just sharing so that I can better understand where they're at. On many occasions this year I've unsuccessfully tried to connect with said person and this may just be their way of making me understand. On the other hand I have been turned to, and this does sound like a cry for help. I'd appreciate any and all opinions on how I can best offer my support as I am taking this very seriously. Being somewhat of a blunt-tool of a man the last thing I want to do is say something insensitive when attempting to offer my heartfelt support.
The reason I am writing this is because reddit is the open arena of knowledge and 3/10 times depending on the subreddit you're able to get some insight.I've been with my SO for about a year and a few months, we've been friends for around 8, she told me in confidence, she has struggled with anorexia and bulimia for years, about 3 months into us breaking the friendship barrier. Being an addict that is in recovery 3+ years (every drug on the face of the planet ) I obviously realize that every human is different and that all I can do is be supportive, and I am nothing but be supportive. It's hard for me to put what is going on into words but... here's the reason I need insight. She's a single mom and its difficult for her to go into treatment, she had been doing internet meetings but from what I can deduce it makes things worse and being part of an NA program I've been to those meetings in real life where there is no help.. What I am asking is...Does anyone have any suggestions where people have been in a program where it's not about what you ate today or what you have purged today? People that have felt the same way and can talk about why.... Because it worked for me.... In my experience face to face meetings were better  for my recovery. I want something similar for her. (Denver Area)Let me know I appreciate EVERY ideaThank You
How soon should I start to "get back out there" during recovery? Should I avoid social situations or fake it until I make it?
Written by Keara Hozella in Quirky Daily. Link at bottom.This upcoming week is National Eating Disorders Awareness (NEDA) Week in the U.S. While this week may signify just yet another cause for some, to others (including me), the message it carries is extremely imperative. It’s crucial to get the word out about this sometimes stigmatized form of mental illness.This year’s theme for NEDAwareness week is “I had no idea,” according to the National Eating Disorders Association website. This year’s theme includes, “focusing on the importance of early intervention and recognizing the diverse experiences of people personally affected by disordered eating,” also according to the site.NEDAwareness Week is vital because of the huge number of people eating disorders affect. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, “Up to 24 million people of all ages and genders suffer from an eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder) in the U.S.,” which proves just how prevalent eating disorders are in the world. Notice how the statistic says all ages and genders. Eating disorders are not limited to illnesses that affect teenage girls. There isn’t a stereotype for eating disorders; they can affect and ruin the life of any individual. That statistic alone should be enough to start talking about eating disorders and stop keeping them a secret.The stigma that surrounds any kind of mental illness can prevent someone who needs help from getting it. It’s reprehensible, and something that needs to be stopped. Talking about mental illnesses, raising awareness, and supporting those you know are struggling can aid in eliminating unnecessary shame and guilt over having a mental illness.While this article is an effort to spread the word and bring attention to NEDAwareness Week, it is also a reminder as to why recovering from this horrific illness is worth it. These reasons are brought to you by me, a woman who has been in recovery from an eating disorder for three years.**Trigger Warning (TW) for talk of eating disorders and some behaviors.****Reason #1: To improve your health, regardless of what it may have been like with your disorder.**Recovery from an eating disorder can bring nothing but improved health for you. While some people may say that they never had a cold or that they felt supremely healthy while in the depths of their disorder, this doesn’t necessarily mean that their immune system or health were at their best. It’s likely that the immune system was suppressed in order to make up for the body shutting down in other ways. Recovering from an eating disorder can reverse or slow the effects of osteoporosis, improve the immune system’s function, and generate a positive shift in overall mental and physical health. Choosing recovery means literally saving your life.**Reason #2: To be able to truly experience life.**Spending so much time focusing on your disorder robs you of the pleasures of everyday life. You aren’t focused on keeping connections with friends and enjoying your life in the depths of an eating disorder because you’re too worried and fixated on what you had, or didn’t have, for breakfast. Your mind cannot juggle so many negative thoughts and calorie counts at once, therefore being entrenched in the world of the disorder means being completely removed from the realm of real life. It may sound cliché to say, but you truly are a shell of a person with an eating disorder. You’re not really present in any situation due to obsessive thoughts of food. Choosing recovery means being able to concentrate on the things that matter to you. For me, this meant strengthening relationships with friends and family members that I had neglected, and graduating from college in the fall 2014 semester. I never would have been able to accomplish those things while in the hell of my eating disorder. Choose recovery to fully participate in your own life.**Reason #3: To be able to say, “I’m in recovery/I’ve overcome my eating disorder.”**I won’t lie and say that recovering from my eating disorder was a smooth and effortless process. It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever attempted to defeat in my life.  Choosing recovery every day is still a struggle, even after an inpatient stay that I swore I would never repeat. Recovery meant being able to admit that I had some issues to sort through and address. It was strangely empowering because I didn’t have to keep up the façade that I had created while struggling with anorexia. Choosing recovery means admitting to having a problem. This admission is terrifying, but liberating. Acknowledging your issues with food and talking about your eating disorder are the first steps to getting help and choosing recovery.The wording throughout this article is intentional. The disorder is not your fault in any way, but deciding to recover from it is your decision. You have to choose recovery every day. It is an arduous task, but one that doesn’t need to be completed alone. Full recovery is possible and worth every bite, therapy session, and tear. Please look for the support of medical professionals, family members, friends, and trusted people in your life to guide you through the process. Please visit the National Eating Disorders Association, the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, or call the NEDA Helpline at 1-(800)-931-2237 to find resources and get help.- See more at: http://quirkydaily.com/nedawareness-week-three-reasons-choose-recovery/#sthash.QmMdut0N.dpuf

I'm finally getting into a residential program! Thanks, r/EDO!Now, for those of you who have been inpatient or residential, what were you glad you had? What do you wish you'd brought?Clearly rules differ between facilities, and inpatient is a lot stricter, but general ideas?OP asks to be linked here, /u/DranoCleanse. Please share here and consider sending her a pm as well.
I am away from my doctor and he told me that when it comes time to refill my prescription for my antidepressant (and sleep aid), that I can go to any clinic and tell them what's going on and they can refill it, as he cannot write enough refills for the time I am here.Is this possible, will they write the script? I am also struggling with binge eating to the extreme and would like to try vyvanse as I have read here that it can help with food obsessions and curbing an appetite. I do not want to come across like I just want a high, but I do want to ask. What do you think is the best way to go about asking the clinic about getting this? I have 30 days left of pills left and really would like to treat my ED. I've tried therapy with a multitude of counselors and didn't get anywhere.
Recently, I came to terms with the fact that I have been suffering symptoms of an eating disorder for a while. However, I am completely unconcerned with my body, and am very comfortable with how I look.My eating disorder began when I was living in a very hostile housing situation. I would hide in my room all day when out of school and try to interact with my Dad and step mother as little as possible. As a result, I often ate less than a meal a day. At first, I felt every little hunger pang, but after three years of avoiding food just so that I could avoid people, I got used to it. Then I got to the point where I could no longer eat normally without feeling nauseas. My stomach wasn't used to a normal amount of food anymore. I didn't think much of it, and let it continue until I was 22 (about a month ago). I only began eating normally again because I realized what sort of damage I was doing to my body, and that it was affecting my mental health and ability to be logical.So I'm wondering if there are others out there who have an eating disorder that started after a long period of unintentional starvation, and how they moved forward with recovery?
We've been married for 4.5 years. We dated for a year before getting married. During our courtship and for a good year after we we married she was bulimic, throwing up on a regular basis. When I first met her she was a normal wieght. Currently, and for the past 3 years, she has stopped throwing up, is also a lot happier in my opinion, but has steadily gained weight and continues to do so. Currently she is just in the obese range in BMI.I love her and I am concerned about her impulse control issues when it comes to food and eating. She eats salads, fruits, etc. but also cannot resist eating excessive amounts of sugar and sweet stuff. I don't know if these carried over from when she ate whatever she wanted and could just throw it up. She has admitted to me she has impulse control issues with her heating.She desperately wants to lose her weight; hates herself for weighing what she does. I don't know how to help her and how to broach the subject of whether or not she needs professional help. Her weight is obviously a very sensitive issue. Also our relationship is on the brinks for other reasons (I have posted for advice on another subreddit). She works a stressful job and is not naturally inclined to physical exercise. How can I help her?
I'm supposed to start residential treatment for BN mid-March, because my new insurance doesn't kick in until then. I have a therapist, but I can't get a dietician or anything until then.I'm really just wondering what you guys suggest to keep me a little more on track until I get help. Right now, I restrict to very safe foods and few calories all day, then B/P a ton in the evening. I just accidentally stayed up until 3am to do so, and I'm exhausted. I want it to stop now, not in March.Does anyone have advice on how to handle this?
Eight years ago, when I was in my early 20's, I suspected I might have an eating disorder. I was going through some major family issues that set my brothers and I into a tailspin (I don't want to get into details in case it triggers anyone else). My younger brother, one of my best friends, began using Meth. Somehow, unintentionally, I think that I also found some unhealthy ways of coping with the negative feelings I was having by counting and controlling calories.Things progressed pretty quickly. In about 6 months I lost a lof of weight (I was barely at a healthy weight to begin with). My friends worried. My doctor worried. I told them all that I was fine; I just needed some time to cope.I got married in the middle of all this. One night, shortly after my wedding and shortly after I'd moved across the country from my family and my problems, my new husband asked if I'd go out to get a drink with him. I didn't want to go because I was at my caloric limit for the day, but he pushed me into it. While out, I got pressured into ordering a drink. A vodka soda. I drank it and immediately insisted on going home because I was so disappointed with myself. I started crying. That's when I got the ultimatum: cut it out or go to treatment.I started to really work on letting go and, slowly, I began to get better. Two years later I was back at a healthy weight. I began viewing that time as a blip; a time when I was stressed and undereating but not a TRUE eating disorder because I didn't think anorexia was something that could go away so easily.Recently though, less than two weeks ago, I found out another traumatic piece of news. I found myself not wanting to eat. At first, it was normal this-is-stressful-and-I-have-no-appetite not eating, but it's now starting to look an awful lot like my behavior 8 years ago (only eating small, controlled amounts when I literally think I might pass out). Only now I'm older and I have a baby and a job and things I need to keep my shit together for. I want to just stop but I don't know how. What do I do?
Hi. I just got it through my thick head that dieting has been the cause of my frequent binges, so no more dieting. But I don't want to gain weight and I don't know how to live without either dieting or being obese (I've been doing it since 13, and I was a fat kid all my life before then). How can I stop dieting-imbalanced eating- without gaining weight? For those who have recovered, what is commonly recommended by dieticians for this? Thank you

Lately I have been using binging/ purging as a stress relief method. I'm in my second year of college and everything is so overwhelming. I have never been good with managing my stress (in high school resorted to self harm). I've been able to avoid typical self harming in the past few years, but in the past year or so my stress over classes and studying has manifested in my body image. About 6 months ago I started purging. It was occasional at first but now I'm afraid it has gotten out of control. I'm now purging sometimes 3-4 times a day and I have developed really terrible binging habits. In only 6 months of this I have already lost weight and think I am developing ulcers in my esophagus (constant mild burning feeling towards the top of my sternum, burns when I drink hot/cold drinks). I don't even want to face what shape my teeth are in. I'm scared that these health issues are already becoming a problem and I don't want permanent damage. I need advice on how to stop this purging addiction and how to break my binging habits.
I struggled with both anorexia and bulimia when I was in college. I slowly recovered thanks to the support of friends and those who had been through similar things. It's been about a year and a half now since I was at my worse, and I gained back the weight I lost and then some…now, I weigh more than I ever have. I struggle daily with this…I want to think I am beautiful, but lately it's been hard due to clothes constantly not fitting, etc. I know that I have gained this weight because I never transitioned from disordered behaviors to healthy ones: I just stopped completely, basically. Now, I basically eat what I want, and I'm positive I overeat. I don't exercise. I drink more than I should. I guess I just am really struggling with knowing I need to be healthy and not knowing how to approach it. I am so tempted to just do the same things I used to, because it seems so much easier than trying to moderate and make "healthy" choices. I'm not trying to be anywhere near as thin as I used to be, but I would like to be a healthy weight for my age/size, and I'm right at the cusp of that. How can I be comfortable with my appearance without resorting to ED behaviors?
So last summer I was in treatment for AN for 16 weeks. I still am not recovered. Anyway, I'm in a new relationship and I don't know if I should tell him about my ed. I don't think I'm ready to, but at the same time I don't want him to find out later and have him be mad or change his mind about me. I don't want him to worry about me or anything, but I have no idea if I should tell him. Should I tell him? 
I have been dealing with overeating for some time now and lately the days in which I lose control are increasing which is especially disheartening since I've begun therapy to try and get better.  I'm so scared to become overweight that I just want to give up and go back to my old ways of restriction because even though I was still miserable then at least I was where I wanted to be weight-wise.  How do you all manage to stay motivated and not lose all hope when bad days begin to outweigh the good days?  Does anyone else sometimes feel that you are self sabotaging yourself in hopes that you actually will become an outcast and people will no longer hold you to the standards of thinness that are deemed desirable in this society?
I'm a woman in her early 20s. I recently lost some weight through exercise and eating better (some calorie counting for two weeks, and I think it triggered my development of weird eating habits because it was the first time I really became aware of calories). As I got near my weight loss goal, it moved away from what I looked like and became like a game with the various numbers. I am normal weight by BMI or a little below. Sometimes I look at the number on the scale or my body in the mirror and think I need gain some weight, but another part of me is uncomfortable with that.I don't count calories, but I find myself trying to tally (no official count, but I have to fight myself at night not to lie there working out caloric estimates for the day). I think I undereat but I don't know. I feel like I think about food a lot. I get kind of obsessive about new recipes and cooking, almost a little out of control in my thoughts at times. I wake up in the night and have to force myself not to start planning out breakfast (and then bargaining with myself and making changes to the plan). I have a hard time stopping thinking about food when my meal is finished. Sometimes I'll portion out reasonable amounts for leftovers, but halve the amount when it actually comes time to eat it. Sometimes I'll take a bite of something and decide, while chewing, that it isn't worth the calories, so I spit it out. I misrepresent my eating to people, claiming I had a snack or am fairly full when I didn't and I'm not. I adjust the day's eating if I'm going to eat out.I feel like my eating and thinking has gotten disordered, and I'm scared of the realization that, while I think I should work to change it, part of me doesn't want to because admitting it's a problem is scary and the idea of getting heavy again or outgrowing my new clothes is scary, too.Do you think I am developing an eating disorder? Does you have any recommendations for me?
I can't seem to find any stories about people in bulimia recovery who are also now /unintentionally/ purging, but that's precisely what's happening to me. I don't think it has anything to do with the size of my meals (or stomach, for that matter) as I've been following a healthy non-ED diet. Is this something related to digestion? I hear horror stories about bulimic intestines "shutting down," but I never took it to heart.
I'm looking at the Monarch Cove facility in Monterey, CA. Does anyone have any experience with them? How is the residential program?
I'm a senior at Tufts University near Boston. I'm currently working on a documentary on eating disorders and body image issues in men. As someone recovering from eating issues myself, this project is near and dear to my heart. I'm looking for male interview subjects around the Boston area with whom I can speak on camera. If necessary, we can talk about face/voice distortion to maintain anonymity. It's for a good cause and I hope this sub can help me!
I don't really have many other people here to talk to who will really understand me. I lost my job at the end of December... since I have been desperately trying to get my Etsy shop up and running, but it's been difficult because I am working with literally zero funds at the moment, except the itty bitty bits of money I make from it here and there.This situation has thrown me (unintentionally) right back into not eating. Simply because I cannot afford food. My refrigerator is completely empty, and my weight is dropping back down again... I was doing so well, SO well... and now circumstances have thrown me into this situation and I don't even want to be here. Does anyone have any recommendations for what I can do or how to eat?
My girlfriend is battling anorexia, and I just found out a few hours ago. She's going to be up in a few hours, and I want to talk to her about it, but I have no idea how to.She means everything to me, and it's killing me inside thinking of losing her. How do I go about this? I tell her every day that she's all I want, that she's good enough. I just don't know what to say that will help that I already haven't. I'm scared. Beyond scared. Of me knowing making it worse. Of me losing her. I.. I don't know what to do. So, someone, anyone, please. Give me any suggestions you can think of to go about this.She's the only person I have.
Backstory: I was diagnosed with BN about 20 months ago. At that time, I wasn't underweight, but my behaviors forced me to drop out of college, so I entered a PHP/IOP program. I learned a lot, and left after 2 months with few behaviors. The past 6 months, I've been trying to lose weight by dieting, and succeeding. More recently, I experienced a significant trauma. I've been back in my EDO for about a month, and already very behind in school. I can't control myself. I've lost a little more weight, and now I'm hovering just above underweight. I'm not feeling healthy.I'm about to start weekly therapy (with an EDO-supportive therapist), but I'm wondering if my situation warrants residential treatment, if I can afford it. What do you guys think? I'm only a month relapsed, but I know the trauma that started it will take a lot of work. I'm also finding it impossible to eat meals and snacks normally without help. Any advice/experiences are welcome.
Hi guys! I'm currently 20, I had an eating disorder/anorexia from the time I was 13-15, was almost hospitalized. I had an amazing recovery and now have one of the healthiest body images and eating habits of everyone I know. Some things I still don't do are: diet, weigh myself, fast on holidays, or count calories.A week ago I got wisdom teeth surgery. I have an extreme health phobia and am paranoid about the holes getting food in them or getting a dry socket, which has led me to heavily restrict my eating down to still all liquids. this is highly triggering for me, and I feel this retraction of eating bringing all the memories, moods, and feelings back of my ED. I haven't relapsed in these 5 years, but once I stop eating, it gets so difficult for me to start, especially when i have a (somewhat) valid excuse.Any advice would be amazing, my school's counselors aren't open now and I'm panicking. How can I fight through this and help myself prevent a relapse?
GF and I are in college now. In high school she had serious problems with anorexia and bulimia. Now it seems she is facing terrible problems again even though she has been better (for the most part) for close to two years. She says she has gained significant weight in the past few months, but I haven't noticed it. I don't know if she's actually monitoring her weight closely, or if it's in her head. She refuses to have sex or even too much general physical contact. I am completely okay with this, as I love the fucking hell out of this girl and only want her to get better. She becomes very upset when I compliment her, and I must stress that I do find her very very attractive. She is afraid that she will inevitably gain weight and I will eventually leave her. I've tried to explain that I love her too much for that, but she won't listen. She is seeking professional help, but she also says she wants to see less of me. I think I make her think about sex and love and physical attraction, and she just wants to forget about all of that. What should I do? How can I help do my part?
I have strugglled with bulimia for 6 years now. It can now be up to 10 + times a day that I purge, depending on when and what I have eaten or drank. I am now at a point where I dont binge, but if I eat or drink anything, no matter how hard I try to keep it down, the anxiety or persistant bloating feeling will not let me. I do not even have to force myself to vomit, I just think about it and it happens. I have done extreme damage to my teeth, which has included the removal of two molars, multiple root canals and cavities. I want help, and I want to fix this. What are the first steps, and what kind of internal damage have I done. I am also nervous about going to the doctor or telling my partner, are these things that I will need to do if I wish to recover? Thanks.
I just started working a twelve step program with this incredible group of women and men in my area. One of the women in the group, after being asked by my temporary (starting out) sponsor if she was free to help out, offered to sponsor me. Briefly, a sponsor is someone who has achieved abstinence with the substance for at least 30 days and is willing to help a new member take their first steps in the program, keep them accountable, take phone calls and texts from them, and offer them advice. My situation is this: my sponsor and I don't know each other well, and therefore our relationship is kind of formal and stiff at the moment. I have a hard time developing rapport with someone immediately (it takes me awhile to become emotionally open with people), but I would like to begin to build a rewarding relationship with this woman that is ultimately fulfilling not just for me, but for her as well. I want her to be able to get something from this sponsor relationship. How can I give back to her? Show her she is appreciated? Connect with her more deeply? I've been asking her for advice and kind of keeping her updated on my habits, as well as talking to her about what's going on with her life, but I want our connection to be a bit more rewarding than it is purely acquaintanceship-formal. After all, we can connect over needing the 12-step program in our lives and working towards changing our lives for the better. Any advice appreciated for forging a more rewarding connection! Especially one where she feels like she, as a sponsor, is getting something out of our relationship. tl;dr: 60/f woman is sponsoring me [21/f] through 12-step program. want to be able to connect with her more deeply and forge a relationship that is sustainable, rewarding for HER as well as ME, more close than it is formal.
Hi everyone!First time posting here. So about 5-6 years ago I dealt with anorexia and lost a lot of weight and was very thin. I needed to gain weight back so I did, and now I am in the healthy weight range.However, my eating habits are not healthy at all. In fact, they are incredibly erratic, and I am concerned about it.First of all, even though I am a healthy weight, I still cannot see my size positively. Most of the time, I view myself as overweight or obese, and even though the numbers say I'm not (and everyone around me says I'm not) I'm incapable of perceiving myself properly. Every once in a while I'll have days where I can't take how "fat" I feel and will eat a dangerously low number of calories. Other days, I will become obsessed with certain foods and feel the need to eat them constantly. I'll decide I need to eat them right now, and that I have to eat it on any and all things I can. And I'll end up binging on these foods until I feel awful about myself.I stay in the healthy weight range because I do this weird yo-yo all the time- of restricting my intake, and alternating that with these gross binges on weird food combinations.And then at the end of the day I feel bad because I still think I'm fat.Does anyone have any advice?
Hey guys, thanks in advance for reading/commenting & sorry for the wall of text, please read it though!So a little background info: My SO is a 16y/o female who has an eating disorder. It all started 2 years ago, she had some kind of virus/disease that woud make her stomach very fragile, she would return all the food she was given... Doctors tried & the disease went away, but she never really recovered, after eating she keeps feeling like she needs to throw up.Now, her relationship with her mother is... poor... her mother calls her fat & questions everything she eats, telling her she'll get fat if she eats too much... I think this is the first cause (and main cause) why she keeps throwing up.She also went to see a therapist, who said it could have something to do with her best friend commiting suicide while she was in the hospital. Because she always blames herself for not being able to attend the funeral. Her mom recently told her she shouldn't see the therapist anymore ecause it wasn't helping, I think it helped a lot because she could really talk to the therapist & always felt better afterwards.Lastly she is really insecure & has never admitted to having an eating disorder, I always supported her & today she admitted that she throws up because she doesn't wanna get fat & that she sometimes forces herself to throw up, but she can no longer feel the difference between throwing up by force or because she feels bad, because food still makes her feel bad.To clarify: when she eats she feels bad & throws up, but she doesn't know if she feels bad because of the disease or because she doesn't want to be fat.She is not fat, but she thinks she is...We haven't been in a relationship for that long, but since she feels she can talk to me about it & tell me secrets she hasn't told anyone in 2 years I feel like I'm the only person who can help her...Guys... I don't know what to do... I really need some advice here... She is an amazing girl and she deserves nothing more than to be happy about her body & feel confident... I just don't know how to help her... any suggestions?Thanks guys!ps: Telling anyone about what's really going on is NOT an option, she trusts me & there is no way I a breaking her trust.Edited to add: Please notify /u/HashtagThrowaway3 if you respond
My girlfriend has been telling me that she's had depression and some self-esteem issues, but recently told me it was more than that and she actually has a binge eating problem. I've never dealt with anything like this before, and have absolutely no idea how I can help her.She's been going through a lot recently and is constantly stressed out - I'm assuming that's a part of it? I've been trying to take her out to movies, the bar, downtown, whatever - but she doesn't seem to want to go out much anymore.Today she told me that she completely binged yesterday and the day before (I was in class so wasn't aware), and she has decided to give me most of her food and gave me her credit card so that she can't buy any more (she's with me more often than not, so I'll start buying everything on her behalf). I'm going to start cooking her some healthy meals when I can, but I really want her to be able to handle it on her own eventually.Does anyone have any advice on how else I can help her?She signed up for a group counseling session that starts next week, but I want to know what I can do before that to help her out.
I have always struggled with being a picky eater, but it has gotten to an all time low.It has been months since I've eaten what many call regular. This is very usual for me.The problem is that no one knows about it, and even the people who do know I struggle with eating (ex: my mom and step dad), don't know how bad it has actually gotten. Whenever I work during the day, my friends at work see me eating everyday at my shift meal. But what they don't know is that when they see me outside of work, I am undereating.I feel tired, weak, and dizzy all of the time, and I need help. But, I'm scared that they won't take me seriously or they will think I'm being overly dramatic.I need to tell someone because I can't get over this problem alone. I just want normal eating habits so badly.How can I overcome being a picky eater? At least be less picky?How can I eat more regularly?How can I be stronger and avoid being weak and dizzy?How do I tell someone, whom should I tell, and how can I be sure to be heard, or taken seriously?Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
my best friend (17-18, F) started losing a whole lot of weight since around September of 2013, so much so that it worried her family and close friends. That peaked at some point but recently she's been eating a bit healthier and has gained a bit of weight. Just a couple weeks ago her older sister told me (15-16, M) that she and her parents have caught her throwing up the food she's eaten in the bathroom a couple times, so it seems to have turned into bulimia. She denies it even when they catch her in the act.  They went to a doctor and now no one in the family closes the door when going to the toilet. She herself doesn't know that i know any of this and knowing her, doesn't want me to. But i want to be of help. This is one of the most important people in my life and i don't want to see her health and life going downhill. I want to help but I'm not sure how. Any advice?
As someone who's recovering from being underweight myself, the Weightwatcher's commercial during the superbowl did a pretty good job at stressing me out. I didn't eat anything for the rest of that day, but I felt like reminding myself and this sub to not let little things trigger us back into the disorder. Remember: there's no reason to be afraid of regular food. From a business perspective, this ad exists only to scare people, which only acts as a tool for making money.What were your thoughts on this commercial? How do you handle things like this?
Hello,I’m a 27 year old guy who has a 18 year old sister with an eating disorder.Me and my family found out about a year and a half ago. Her disorder has been categorized as anorexia.She’s had a lot of “friends” let her down all through her life, and is a very sensitive person. She has almost no self worth or self confidence as of now. She has nightly fits, which could be described as similar to anxiety attacks. They usually come after she’s eaten (she doesn’t eat much) or right before sleeping. She tense up, she’s recently began also holding her breath. She gets these thoughts in her head that she wants to disappear, that it would be better if she weren’t here. I know what those are signs of. I suffer from anxiety myself, but that’s besides the point.She is seeing a psychiatrist, and she’s been at some brain scanning treatment as well, which she has now stopped. She is getting help, but I’m thinking it’s the wrong kind of help, but I’m trying to get my parents to understand that now.What I’m here to ask from you, is to get some perspective on some things. Recently I’ve beginning to think we, as a family, has been handling her eating disorder in a very wrongly fashion.What I’ve beginning to realize is that we’ve trying our best to remove all triggers around her. She gets to decide what’s for dinner, every meal is constructed to get her to eat. There’s a lot of “mmm” and “this is good” going on. She is consulted on what’s for dinner, every single night.Everybody in the apartment (I don’t live at home, but when I’m home, it’s expected from me as well) is behaving, as to not trigger her fits.Which usually comes anyway.I want to say that there’s a lot of love and support. We’re all trying to help her, but I’m just starting to believe, that what we’re really doing, is creating a reality around her, where she can live with her condition, which just makes it worse.When I had anxiety, I could theoretically just avoid any triggers, and basically live with the condition my entire life. Problem was that one of the triggers was going to bed, so I sort of had to deal with it.I’m not sure what I’m asking here. What I’m thinking is, that I have to talk to my parents, and get them to understand that they can’t design every meal around my sister.It just seems to me, that we’re creating an environment where her eating disorder will thrive, and not get better.Another thing I’m considering is, that if my parents don’t realize this, and won’t get her the help she needs, that I have to tell them, that I won’t be part of treating her like this anymore. Talk to her, and explain to her, that I’m there for her, but that I believe that the way they’re going about things now, is more hurtful than helpful.Not saying I’ll just bail. But right now I think I’m part of keeping her in, or worsening, her condition.My parents think she’s doing better, but I think that it’s just because they’ve gotten effective as removing any trigger, which just makes it hard for everybody to live like a normal person.I KNOW we have to get her some help, that’s specialized in dealing with eating disorders, so I guess what I’m asking is, if my suspicion about the way we’re going around this at home, seems right? Or if I’m completely off the charts? What should I do?
I'm currently in recovery for bulimia, anorexia, and self harm. I have a history of depression and anxiety and I've been working with my therapist and psychiatrist to come up with new "rituals" or behaviors to replace some of the more destructive things I've used to cope in the past.One of the things that I've found to be really helpful overall is crafting - specifically knitting or crocheting because it keeps your hands busy and can be pretty meditative. Someone suggested a few months back a craft idea about creating paper chains to track your progress with recovery (each chain is a day, colors represent different things). I'd be interested to hear if anyone has other visual aids that help with recovery?
Keeping this short. I've just started dating a girl who's in recovery from anorexia and bulimia. I'm looking for suggestions on what, and what NOT, to say and do. She eats well and is in good health, and I want to support her in that. She's great about the fact that I have no idea what to say or do, and she's very happy that I ask about what foods she'd like to eat, if she has any aversions, if I can cook for her, etc. She responds really positively to being called beautiful (it's not something she heard often in past relationships, I think) but I want to know what else might be helpful to say to remind her that I think she's absolutely amazing exactly how she is.
I've relapsed pretty badly last summer and it recently got worse this past month. I would normally just talk it out with close friends but at this point I think I've become a bother to them. I got tired of the "just love yourself" quotes that they stole from tumblr. I have no family support either. They're part of the reason why I relapsed.I'm heavily considering therapy at my college campus but I'm absolutely terrified and don't know what to expect. Has anyone been through therapy? Do you recommend it? What was it like?
For the last ~7 years I've had several entwined problems: alcoholism, anorexia-turned-bulimia, and an amphetamine addiction.Due to lack of funds and support, I've only received a little formal help for the former two; I've mostly been left to deal on my own.I eventually quit the speed which was difficult, but very final. It's not there? Well, not an option then. I still miss it sometimes, but it's mostly very liberating.That leaves the drinking and ED.At my worst as a bulimic, emptying my bank account to go on binges, purging many times a day. I feared for my life.Overall, I've recovered pretty remarkably- I still think about the consequences of what I do and don't eat on a near-daily basis, but I only truly purge-relapse once every few months.I've recently been on a serious sobriety binge, which is glorious, but I find that as soon as that one vice lessens, my preoccupations with food burn a little brighter until I eventually relapse again, which triggers me to want to drink again.I once got into drinking-related legal trouble and admitted to a counselor I was struggling with an eating disorder as well. I was given a couple pamphlets before I faced the judge. I don't remember specifics, but I learned that a disproportionate amount of female alcoholics also suffered from eating disorders. I know I'm not alone.I'm new to this subreddit and tried to explain this as honestly as possible whilst refraining from mentioning anything too specific/triggering. I guess what I'm asking is, of other people that have these concurring problems, what has helped you manage both of them successfully? I've been attending AA and can mostly handle sobriety, as drinking is something you just... either do, or don't do, but how do I carry that determination over to something with no clear on/off bounds, and how do I help prevent the two from bleeding into each other?Any advice is eagerly welcomed.
I'm not sure this is the right place for this because I think my problem involves a lot more than just my eating disorder. I've been bulimic for three years now. I use laxatives more than anything, which makes me feel like I can't talk to anyone about my problems because it's disgusting, and because I feel like even people with similar problems will find me completely unrelatable.Currently I'm not getting a lot of sleep because I'm terrified of having an arrhythmia or something. Any time my boyfriend suggests a way for me to help myself I think of a reason not to. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist but I never mentioned my ED to them, I've been seeing them for years, and I feel like now they're going to think I'm a bad person if I'm open with them. I don't want my parents to find out about my issues, even though I live with them, because I don't want them to feel like failures, and because I already feel ashamed and I don't want to make it worse.I'm not sure what to do. I know I need to get better. I'm in constant fear of dropping dead and I'm miserable and I know what I'm doing isn't right. I think I just need to convince myself to be helped, and I don't know how to do that.Can anyone offer advice on what I can do to get better?
I have a friend who has an eating disorder. She keeps at a healthy weight and has no visible signs, but she eats next to nothing, obsessively counts calories, and is a brilliant liar. I know she binge-eats and then fasts. The eating problems came after she got over problems with cutting, however the experience she had with the help she got was absolutely terrible, and she has something against going and getting help. Her mother has also suffered from problems before and she's afraid of triggering them like she had done previously if she asks for help, and her father is not very understanding. At the moment the help she is getting consists of myself and her friend I don't know who attends her school and gets her to eat at lunchtime. We don't attend the same schools which cuts down our contact time significantly. Everybody else is oblivious. I am worried because I know she's getting worse and soon we won't be able to keep what little control we have. She said she would see some help but as far as I know, we need parental consent?We live in New Zealand if that helps any. Any help/advice would be appreciated. I'd like to respect the fact she doesn't want to tell her mum as much as possible.
My wife literally won't eat vegetables or fruits, and all she likes is pizza, taco bell, burritos, etc. She won't put anything on her burritos, sandwiches, whatever except for gobs of meat and cheese. There is literally (and I mean literally) no vegetable that she likes, or even will try. I googled being afraid of vegetables and I got: Lachanophobia.She has been like this her whole life and since we've been together for 5 or so years whenever I bring it up she'll flip out and get angry at me. I've tried to get her to go to counseling because I know this is terrible for her health, but again she just gets angry about it and won't listen.I'm worried now more than ever because she is about 15 weeks pregnant. For one I'm worried it will affect the baby. Two I'm worried that this is how my child is going to eat.
I've recently (within the last couple of months) reached a healthy weight after a sudden encounter with anorexia. It was the first time I had lost a significant amount of weight, and my family didn't really know how to handle it. Eventually I got to the point where I was offered an ultimatum: gain weight or go to hospital. I chose to struggle through with it and gain weight, and managed to reach a healthy weight again. However, although I feel much better in myself (much less rigid thinking, less anxious, etc) I'm still deeply insecure about how I look, but I'm working on it. But my problem is, I just can't seem to feel satisfied without eating huge amounts of food! Eating normally just doesn't seem to fill me up. I'll eat a normal sized, well balanced dinner but then I'll have to eat toast, cereal bars, fruit, whatever I can find in the fridge, etc, to feel truly satisfied. I was wondering- is this because I genuinely need the calories, even though I'm a healthy weight? (And I don't just mean minimally healthy weight either). Or is it because my hormones and signalling is all out of whack? It's very confusing for me, and quite stressful at times. Any advice would be hugely helpful!
Hi there. I am a journalist and recovered anorexic writing an article against the common idea that eating disorders are caused by 'unrealistic body standards' set by the media/Disney/Barbie.I want to highlight how the disorder isn't about vanity but is a serious mental problem, and this predominate cultural narrative is damaging.If anyone wants to discuss their experiences with me please comment below, just to indicate your willingness, and I will DM you to get details.Many thanks,Amelia 
I have always struggled with bulimia since I was a freshman in high school. I finally quit on my own my junior year. I hadn't made my self throw up for almost three years. Then I became depressed and stopped eating much, everyone started telling me how great I looked and it stuck. I became anorexic and I loved how I felt and the way I looked but my boyfriend became concerned and I was too ashamed to tell him the truth so I just slowly worked my way up to eating again but now that I've gained weight I found myself going back to old habits of puking. Recently it's like i'm not even hungry but the thought of puking is relaxing to me. I force myself to eat a lot and then purge it because for some reason I feel like its all my problems purging from my body and flush it away. It's my escape and I hate it. I know its not healthy and I want to quit but then in a few hours I find myself doing it again. I know I need help but is there any suggestions?
I've suffered from an ED when I was younger and managed to get out of it without treatment. It wasn't very severe but I was still losing a lot of weight in such a short amount of time. My parents found out and helped me get through it. Since then I've stayed positive and never fell back to old habits.However, a few months ago I started binging and purging myself. Then even more recently I started starving myself. My urges to restrict are very strong. I can't stop, but I'm scared for myself. My country doesn't offer therapy services, and I'm afraid if I tell my mother and father they'll force me to eat and I'll end up purging myself too. Please help me, is there anything I can do to stop thinking this way?
I had anorexia in highschool (4 years ago), including restricting food and over-exercising. I'm pretty much recovered now: I eat totally normally, exercise like a few times a week for maybe half an hour, and am a healthy weight.I thought I'd put that all behind me, but I recently got the opportunity to travel with a student group at my university for the month of October, essentially on a road trip around Australia for five weeks. Sounds so incredible, and totally covered financially by my school! Coming from the US, this is a huge trip that I'd never be able to do otherwise, and it would be with a ton of friends, too.But I had a total panic about it -- the prospect of sitting in a car for that long, unable to stand up or walk around, absolutely terrifies me. In my everyday life I don't really notice any fear of sitting, but I don't really have to sit for more than four hours any given day (although I definitely do sit around more than that).It's just the idea of HAVING to be sedentary that freaks me out, and reminds me of when I was in high school not being able to handle staying seated during the school day since I felt like I needed to walk around. It's not claustrophobia either; small spaces have never bothered me as long as I'm not stuck sitting for hours.Basically I don't know what I'm looking for from this post, but I just had to get this off my chest. Has anyone successfully dealt with this kind of lingering panic of being still for long-ish periods of time?
I modelled for a long time, and loved it. Maybe a little too much. My body type isn't perfect, so I spent a long time exercising and dieting.In 2011 it started getting out of control. I have a history of OCD and depression, and I think those had a huge effect on my habits. I wanted to model so badly I would severely restrict and then binge and then overexercise. I would feel instant guilt over anyone's comments on my food, be it good or bad.I had been hospitalized for 3 weeks in intensive cardiac care after severely restricting and overexercising in 2013. I was diagnosed with ARFID and anorexia while in hospital. They told me if I hadn't come in that day I would have died.However, I fervently denied it. I hid it from everyone. I told everyone I just wasn't hungry or had stomach pain. My mum and boyfriend believed me. I relapsed in February 2014...then July...then I got severely depressed and relapsed in October 2014. I didn't tell anyone why I was that depressed, I figure my boyfriend figured out I had some issue because I constantly called myself ugly and such, but I never told him I had this illness. I told him it was all a misdiagnosis, I was fine. I hid all the guilt and unhealthy habits.My mum unwittingly has been contributing by making comments about my food. It broke me so badly, but yet I still refused to tell anyone. I avoided her, broke down when I was supposed to return home from vacation. But how do I tell my SO (who was there) "Oh yeah, I don't want to go home because my mum perpetuates my eating disorder I never told you about??" So I just said I wasn't going to be okay going home. I cried and had a huge breakdown.In the end of December, I had a mental breakdown because I just couldn't control my OCD, depression, and eating disorder all at once. Because I am having trouble facing my mum about this, and it's been festering inside me for years now. My boyfriend then decided to take a break beginning of January because I was having panic attacks all the time and he couldn't handle it.I am in treatment for all three, but still nobody knows. I have overcome my OCD and depression. But not the eating disorder. It's still there, just less because of therapy. I can feel it pulling me back again and it's stressing me out.I feel really terrible because I hid it from everyone... yet I know it had a huge impact on my relationship (self-esteem) and even affects my family. I don't know how to tell them or what to do. If I tell my SO, he might just pull away further...yet I want to be honest and tell him why things were so difficult. I want to tell him this stuff but I don't know how. I don't want it to make him leave for good. I just feel lost.Anyone have advice?
When I was a teenager I was diagnosed with anorexia. I was in therapy for a few years and have been relatively symptom free now in my mid-20s.I have a new roommate who is a Kinesiology major and super into healthy eating and fitness. She goes to the gym everyday and posts a meal plan for herself on the fridge every week. I feel very self conscious eating around her (not that I eat super unhealthy foods but I am not as strict as she is) and seeing her meal plans makes me feel guilty and critical about my own food choices. I restricted my own food intake a little bit last week and I'm starting to worry about slipping back into my illness.I don't want to tell her about my history or how I've been feeling but I need to find a way to not feel so triggered by her activities. Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone been in a similar situation before? Thank you so much.
I've been seeing a therapist/nutritionist for the past 2 months. It's my first real attempt at getting help. I've struggled with ED for 10 yrs and when I decided to start therapy, I was ready to recover. A week ago, my meal plan added more. It went well for a week, and then something changed. I went from positive about the changes and recovery to being very depressed and restricting more than usual. I can't get thoughts out of my head that I'm failing or that I'm not sick, I look fine, I don't need help yet. Is this normal to go from positive about recovery to not wanting to?I feel crazy and fucked in the head. It can't be right to feel like I have to get a lot worse before I deserve this help. As if I need to be dying or emaciated or having everyone worry about me to deserve getting help. Can anyone relate? I feel so alone and crazy. I don't want to get out of bed anymore. I don't want to feel hungry or look at food or count another calorie. I just want to give up and disappear. I'm really scared.How can I stay true to recovery? Why are all these difficult emotions coming up?
What are some of the best things to say to someone who is in the middle of a struggle? Meaning, if they are voicing b/p urges what are helpful things to say? If they are expressing exercise urges what are some things to say? How can someone be supported without feeling invalidated or shamed? How can one be supportive and not co-dependent?
My GF has body image issues and quite possibly disordered eating. For example, she is very hard on herself when she eats more than planned or has to miss a trip to the gym (I should add she about a pound shy of being underweight--though she is not losing weight, but has been at the same weight for a couple years). I suggested numerous times that she talk to a therapist about these issues (when a previous therapist wanted to discuss her disordered eating instead of other issues my GF wanted to discuss, she stopped therapy). When I suggest she try talking to someone she gets angry and tells me I just "need to be more sympathetic" and "supportive"--so, short of saying, "It will be OK" when issues like these come up (which they frequently do), I honesty have no idea what to do/say. Any help would be appreciated!
My Girlfriend of 8 months has an eating disorder and I want to be supportive as possible. She has been struggling with it for 2 years and recently after being inpatient (May-June) she gained weight. Now she is self conscious about it but it's not like it bothers me or like she is very over weight. She has a very supportive family, therapist, and psychiatrist that have helped her so much to recover to the best of her ability, however she still is very worried about her weight and on some days only eats a meal or two with a few snacks in between. She understands and accepts her disorder and is very open about it to me, but I would just like some more advice from others struggling with ED so I can know how to handle certain situations or things that commonly bother people with an ED.
I am in the middle of recovery from an eating disorder, which I first developed when I was 16 and it has been an ongoing battle ever since. I have suffered very badly twice before my most recent struggle, each time it has been about different things and with different manifestations.This time it was definitely to do with body image, and over exercise. I am currently seeing a CBT psychologist as well as a dietician etc. I am trying really hard to find the demons in my head , but am really really having a hard time accepting my weight gain. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to cope? I realise that everything is relative but right now I feel like I want to stop gaining.
I have struggled with my weight for years and have lost about a significant portion of  twice now. The first time was from being anorexic and the second bulimic. I got pregnant with my son and stopped binging and purging but my son is two now and I find myself back in the same pattern. I need help. I don't want to kill myself by doing this. Can anybody suggest how I should start to get help? Thanks!
I am a mom to 4 kids, 2 of each sex. My oldest, 13 yo daughter, had been showing signs of disordered eating. I tried not to think to much of it, believing the philosophy that food/diet is only a big deal if you make a big deal of it. I think that only works if there isn't an existing problem.Two years ago or so, my husband and I, who are both clinically obese, started using My Fitness Pal to track caloric intake. He and my daughter, over my arguments, set her up an account. He feels that everyone should be aware of their calories. I argued that she was 11, and no, she should just eat when she is hungry and stop when she is not. I lost. My daughter was eating normally at that time, and at the upper end of a healthy weight. The pediatrician said that she was in a category called "in danger of becoming overweight." I did not mention this to my husband, because one of his big fears is that our kids will make choices that lead to them becoming significantly overweight.With growth spurts in height, I didn't think much of her slimming down. It happened slowly, and seemed reasonable. Grandparents, assholes, would make comments to me or her about how great she was looking, my dad privately tell me she had "lost weight and looked great."She has a friend who has been diagnosed with ED-NOS. The friend is constantly texting her about food and weight, and negative self-labeling. I know because I broke down and snooped through my daughter's phone.I'd feel more guilty than I do, but I found a lot of texts between the two of them. I have not told my husband. Recently, when I told him, hey, have you noticed our daughter has kind of... stopped eating? he told me that she had a very healthy relationship with food, and I should back off. I plan to talk to him about it this weekend. I have emailed a few therapists, and am hoping to get her into counseling, soon, like this coming week.My daughter has also struggled with anxiety the past few years. Being the oldest, she feels a lot of weight on her shoulders, real and imaginary. In the last few days, with this new information and confirmation of my concerns, I have been thinking about the parallels between ED and hoarding. I am a compulsive hoarder. Could my mental health issues be nurturing hers? Is this something I could have prevented, if I had put my foot down two years ago? Or got my own mental health under control years ago, before it could have impacted hers? She is still eating, she is not in need of hospitalization, but I know that things can spiral, so I am trying to play catch up now. I feel like I have been fiddling while rome burned. I just don't know what to do to help her grow into a happy, healthy adult. I don't want her to be depressed or anxious, or seeking control and stability from outside forces. I just feel lost. Help me help her? Please?
I'm currently recovering from b/p anorexia, still have a large amount of weight to gain. My whole life I've been a competitive gymnast. The first time I underwent refeeding (about 4 yrs ago, forced by my parents) I continued to workout, essentially as a reward system (basically they divided my weight gain into percentages. If I gained 20% of the weight I could go to 20% of practices, 40% was 40% of practices and so on). Now that I'm in college I don't have access to a gymnastic gym everyday. Also, my treatment team is very adamant about the absolutely no exercise philosophy. However, compulsive exercise is not a form of purging for me; in fact exercise tends to prevent binge and purge episodes since I know purging hinders my workout performance and the physical act of working out relieves stress for me. Is there any safe way I can exercise during recovery? Maybe weight lifting? I know cardio is a no go due to worries about heart complications, but is there a form of exercise (besides yoga, I really am not a huge fan of yoga) that wouldn't be physically dangerous?
In December, I went to counselling and was told I either had an eating disorder, or at the very least disordered eating. I've started going to a support group every Monday.My problem is, I am a 3rd year student teacher, and I've struggled with juggling eating and the school environment in the past, during my placements. First of all, it's a really structured time (being a school day), and for me, I can't eat large meals. If I get full, I feel so guilty. But if I get hungry and have to stay hungry for a couple of hours (eg a lesson), I then get into a cycle of telling myself and believing disordered thoughts about hunger. My current lifestyle is eating something small and healthy whenever I am hungry. Obviously this isn't ideal for a school environment. Over Christmas was a really stressful time for me because I couldn't just eat when I wanted to, and when we did sit down to eat, I'd get weird looks if I didn't eat everything. I don't know how to cope with that again for 6 weeks.Second of all, in every school I've been in before, all the teachers are on diets (and especially when it's January). So every time I'm on placement, while I'm dealing with problem no. 1, I've got my peers, who I am supposed to be constantly learning from, saying how they 'shouldn't be eating this xyz' etc etc. It's not been a problem in the past too much but I've got a lot worse this past 6 months and I really don't know how I'll cope.Thanks so much if anyone can give me any advice.
We have a new subreddit for for those who have Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), also known as, Selective Eating Disorder, food neo-phobia, or adult picky eating./r/ARFIDPicky eating is normally only associated as a phase of childhood, but the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has recently recognized that this disorder can continue on into adolescence and adulthood.This subreddit is a place to discuss ARFID and related anxiety, express frustration, share tips, and help others gain an understanding of what this diagnosis encompasses.If this sounds like you, please head over and help us create this new community! Thanks!
I'm a 19 year old male college student who, after years of just assuming I was a "picky eater," realized that it's probably a bit worse than that and this is honestly the first place I turned to.**First of all, I REFUSE to eat anything with toppings on it.** With few exceptions everything has to be completely and utterly plain. This basically means any kind of burger can only be the meat and the bun. If there's anything else on it then I will flat out refuse to eat it. I know in the rational part of my brain that this is absurd and I should just do it, but the few times I have actually tried to eat something new I legitimately had a physical gag reflex to it. **I don't eat vegetables, only eat a few 'approved' fruits,** won't dip my food in any kind of condiment or sauce.**If it's not completely plain or it's food that is not on my 'approved' list, then I will refuse to even try it** despite my rational mind going "Dude, come on, you're a grown ass man. Eat the food." My approved list is very small. I'm almost entirely carnivorous. My 'approved' list basically comes down to this: Pizza and meat (no fish)**I get severe anxiety when I get put in a situation where I might not be able to eat my plain hamburger or chicken fingers, which are my go-to food items.** I recently had to eat dinner with my girlfriend's family at her house, and I had to try new food. I had an anxiety attack and was (thankfully) calmed down by my girlfriend. I went down to try this new food I had never had. I took one bite and literally gagged so hard I almost threw up this food on the dinner table. I then took a few more bites, and ended up only eating like 1/3rd of the plate. **Because of this anxiety, I pretty much eat every single meal alone so I don't get judged.****In addition to this 'picky eating,' I do not eat enough. I don't feel hungry a lot,** and when I do, I get hunger for certain foods. If these foods aren't available, oh well, I guess I'm just not gonna eat tonight. I also never eat breakfast. **I often wake up reallllly hungry,** but if I try to eat in the morning then I feel nauseous and I have the same gagging reaction if I try to eat anyway. So, my breakfast is light and then at lunch, when for some reason, my body and mind actually allow me to eat food.Guys, sorry that this is so long. I really feel like this is a pretty severe problem that I have though, and it is making my life difficult in more ways that I could have ever imagined. I'm losing weight because of it, and I think it is making me unhealthy. Any input or help I could get would be excellent. Thank you.Does this sound like ARFID or SED? How can I not have anxiety around foods not on my list?How can I become comfortable eating with others?
My best friend suffered from an ED from which she recovered just before I knew her.She also suffers from OCD and from talks with her I've learned that her ED involved a lot of calorie counting, binge/purges and compulsive exercise.For the last few months I've noticed she has lost weight (still within healthy range) and her social media and text messages often include references to healthy eating, and exercise. She often is late to plans because she 'had to' go to the gym (direct quote multiple occasions)I'm concerned she may be struggling again.I was wondering a few things: 1. Is there a way to tell the difference between ED behaviour and being committed to a healthy lifestyle? 2. If she is relapsing - what are the best ways for me to support her?
I'm a 24 year old male who is an incredibly picky eater. For the last 2 decades I've lived in ignorance and thought this was something that I would eventually wake up and be over one day, but I'm afraid that my limited diet and (possibly self induced? I honestly don't know where this stemmed) phobia will one day kill me.Until I moved away for university, I lived primarily on sandwiches with spread, bready foods like pancakes, and a few easy fruits snacks. The combination of limited options in a dorm dining hall setting and the embarrassment of eating in front of others introduced chicken and fish into my diet. Both still have to have some sort of breading for me to stomach. My girlfriend has started making homemade chicken fingers that aren't like I'd usually eat, and eating REAL chicken was a big step for me but I feel like I haven't made much more progress.I avoid social situations that involve food because its embarrassing ordering my usual food at a restaurant and feeling like a kid. I get embarrassed when people edge me on and try to get me to try something. 9.5 times out of 10 its with good intentions, but I don't think they understand how hard it actually is for me. Lately I feel depressed, sluggish, I have aches and pains, I feel my sex drive deteriorate (causing other relationship troubles on top of everything else) and I believe that a large portion of this stems directly from my eating habits. I have no idea how to get better from this. I have no idea how to squash the fear and just branch out. I've never tried a vegetable in my life.I want to be healthy. I want to get over this self inflicted negativity. If anyone has ever been in the same situation and has any tips, they would be greatly appreciated. Tl;dr: 24 year old scared about eating chicken fingers all the time, and i'm too scared to try anything new because my body always rejects it. Help me. Please.
I'm about six months into recovery and I'm doing pretty well, but I'm still having such a hard time finding things to eat. I've always been a picky eater, and liking so few foods makes recovery so much harder. I'm not doing it on purpose, and it really is just a burden at this point. Any advice on how to learn to enjoy more foods or open yourself to different tastes?
My girlfriend and I are in our early twenties and I just discovered she has an eating disorder, AN. When she told me she said she just discovered she had it, maybe she was just telling me that to feel less bad. Anyway, the good thing is that she told me and recognize that she has a problem.She told me she always thought she was not slim enough to have an ED and that she thought she was doing this for her job (model). But she now realize she is doing this for herself the most.Our situation is a bit particular in the sens that she traveling a lot for her job while I stay to finish my degree, so I can't be beside her all the time to provide physical support. She can't realistically quit her job since it's a really good opportunity and very good money.I've skim trough the already posted questions but it was hard to find something similar to my situation. The thing is she can't consult a therapist since she's never at the same place for long and even then she can get called on a job within a one day notice. Also one advice was to avoid the magazine, television, etc so it doesn't reinforce the idea of good looks but it's a little bit hard when you are the person in said magazines.We have a kind of traditional relationship where I'm the pillar and make most of the decisions so she has no stress. I want to stay the strong rock she can count on. I have to admit that at this moment all of this is getting a little bit over my head and need some direction as how to handle it. I want to make is easy for her to slowly appreciate her body and to transition into a healthy diet after.Thank you very much for your time and sorry for the sloppy English.
I've been battling with anorexia on my own ever since I began middle school, about a decade ago. While friends and family have expressed little concern at times about my habits, I've never actually sought out help or treatment. I'm getting to one of the worst points I've been in during this crippling battle and for once I'm considering seeking help at a mental institute or something of the likings. I understand most places require a pretty strict eating regime pertaining to those in need of recovery, but is there any sort of exception? I'm pretty passionate about remaining vegan and I'm not sure if I could go through with treatment if it meant changing so many predominate aspects of my lifestyle as I can recall it.
Recently I've accepted that I have a very unhealthy relationship with food, and that I need to change this. When I kept track of how much I was eating, it turns out that it was far, far too little - I think no one noticed because I would just not eat, then eat multiple servings or something and people would think I was clearly eating enough.So... I've been eating more. I wish I could do this under the supervision of a medical professional, but that's really not possible for me. Though I sense that I generally feel somewhat more 'content' (maybe), the biggest issue and worry for me right now is that I'm extremely sleepy and sore the entire day. Is this common while refeeding (I've heard this is the term)? I feel like I should actually have more energy now that I'm eating more, but it feels like I was actually most energetic when I'd been restricting myself for sometime.
Hi, I'm a 3rd year nursing student currently doing a research project on eating disorders (mainly anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa) and the stigma society has towards these illnesses. My goal is to come up with innovative ways to slowly break down the stigma. I am wondering if anyone has come across any:1) Videos pertaining the stigma of eating disorders 2) Information or other media driven pieces relating to thisOr if you have a personal story surrounding stigma, please share.
A friend of mine been losing weight pretty rapidly. She had been advised to lose some weight by a doctor. She is down many pounds over 3 to 4 months.Currently she says she is happy with meals that are like snacks and lots of water.As far as I know she has not shown any symptoms like fainting, being dizzy, or the like, but she is quite constipated.Should I be worried? She has always eaten a lot while I have known her, but not recently.
I'm going to spare you an extremely long story because if you've dealt with anorexia/ bulimia I'm sure you know exactly what I'm going to say around that time in my life. This is the third time I've typed up a post for this sub and I'm sick of not actually posting it out of fear.I tried to "defeat" my ED by drinking. That lasted around a year and I've been bulimia free for over two years. Predictably, I developed a binge eating disorder. I have two therapists that cover my PTSD. Asking them to focus on my ED alone would keep me from more immediate issues being managed. I have never sought professional ED help. A week ago I decided it was a safe time to start restricting my diet in a healthy manor- as the binging has left me morbidly obese at this point and I'm as unhappy as I was when I had my AN. I'm working on a low cal diet around a safe amount of calories per day to get to a healthy weight, but I've been keeping my intake at a barely anorexic level because fucking ED doesn't just disappear and tricks me I guess. I thought it was clear thinking then I realized it was that dusty bitch pretending to be me. I hope that makes sense. After I decided to stop throwing up, I began to see my ED as someone inside of me that i needed to work with. I hope really that makes sense... It's way too easy for me to restrict my calories to an unhealthy level and that has me concerned.I want to do this right.I can't work out very much because I have disabling vertigo so my weight loss will revolve around changing my relationship with food.Are there any videos or books I can read that made a difference for you? Any websites where the focus is on people like me? Thank you so very much in advance for any responses.
Hi all,My girlfriend has bulimia and I am her (often overly) worried boyfriend. She's had it for a couple years and doesn't quite have it under control. We've been great friends for longer than that but only became romantic recently. I do my best to be loving and supportive without trying to be Mr. Fix-it. We don't talk much about her disorder, but every time it comes up it hasn't improved.Recently, she got approved to design and model an outfit for a competition, and I'm worried about her bulimia flaring up. She's done modeling in the past and it didn't do her any favors in the BN department. I'm afraid to ask her if it's going to affect her in any way. I realize there's almost nothing I can do, but I just needed to vent about how powerless I feel and accept any advice you all can give me. I just want the woman I love to be happy and healthy.Thanks /r/eatingdisorders. You guys do good work.
I am currently a HS wrestler with bulimia because of my fear of "not making weight" for matches. i dont have anywhere to go or anybody to talk to and i found this subreddit and i just wanted to share and ask for advice from this community. i had this problem last year during wrestling season and it subsided afterwards but now it's coming up again and i'm beginning to purge about once a day. thank you so much!How can I avoid bulimia this season?
please help me... i know it says to keep it short so i will try. i have been bulimic for the past three years. unfortunately in the country where i live there is no ED treatment center and our mental hospitals aren't really functioning very well. i have been to one about a month ago because on top of my purging i've started drinking a lot. that is about all i do - i drink at night and if i do eat something during the day i will purge it.i am of normal weight and i am EXTREMELY EXTREMELY scared to even try recovery.what do i say? who do i even call? what if they make me eat and i start gaining a lot? like really a lot? will they give me a lot of meds?i feel like everyone is going to say just go home and don't be a huge pussy. you're fine, just eat. but i can't. and i can't live like this anymore. i've already had a kidney infection that i am almost 100% sure came from my extreme laxative abuse. i will get extreme burning sensations in my stomach and sometimes a feeling like a cramp (not hunger pangs...those used to happen when i was restricting).my entire family has no clue or knows very little (i am married, with two kids) and they keep telling me to "snap out of it".i am so very very scared and i feel lost because i have no idea how and where to start and i feel like such a failure.i have no idea what my question even was. im sorry....
I I am with Drexel University and I am doing my senior thesis on living with mental health disorders. The project will be an educational resource for the general public to attempt to lessen the misconceptions about these disorders. I want to provide primarily first hand information so I am trying to get this survey out. I have already posted it on a few other subs and people seem to respond well.[Link here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lc70FgP3w1uYNhc8vmQSKyzX0fXHwHl-4tnmr3b9X_Q/viewform).Thank you
She's been doing this for a few years now (67 yrs old). I believe she is starving herself. I calculated she needs a recommended amount of a day. I have been counting her calories behind her back (she is visiting us for 4 weeks), she is clearly undereating. Any time I try to get her to eat something she says she's not hungry. For breakfast she'll have a very small portion. For lunch she'll have, again, a very small portion, for dinner it is hard for her to escape and I try to make her eat but can't ever get more a very small portion in her then it's "i'm full, really, mmm that was good". She has no snacks or anything. She doesn't look healthy, looks bony and somewhat pale. When I say things like "I am worried about you, you do not eat enough", it's always "I'm fine, I feel great". She is yawning all day and nervous/jittery. I think she's surely malnourished and likely to kill herself soon by doing this to her body. My father is an instigator in all this telling her she's fat and when she starves tells her she looks good. She's very skinny at this stage and gaunt. I can't see any way to change this. Is there a name for what she is doing? Is this common in some women her age? How can I best help her? Thanks.
My daughter has just been diagnosed with an ED. She is 13, undereating and underweight. I am not sure it is an ED and want to get her the right help. 6 months ago she started with stomach pains whenever she ate. Numerous trips to the gp and eventually to a pediatrician by Sept she was diagnosed with stomach inflammation. However she has not responded to medication and in fact limited her diet even more, both in variety of foods she can eat and quantity. Scans and blood tests have all come back completely normal, they can't find any reason to explain the worsening pain. We saw the consultant again this week who basically said she can't find anything physically wrong with her now, and believes she has developed an ED and the original inflammation has healed. She is booked to go to hospital next week.However i don't see evidence that she wants to lose weight, although I do see that she has many inconsistencies regarding what is good or bad food and when she feels stressed it directly affects her stomach. Can it be an ED without the weight issues? I guess I don't know a lot about ED and am worried that if it isn't, the Drs will miss what it is and my girl will hate me for not believing her. On the other hand if it is an ED I want her to get the help she needs to be well again. My heart is breaking for her either way. Can any of you relate? How can I support her if it is an ED?Thank you.
A week from today, I'm involved in an event for teenagers. Within that, there's panel discussion where we talk and people ask questions. I'm on one for mental health and my focus is eating disorders. I used to have one when I was ~13 and I'm 18 now. I'm recovered but I still have to check myself when I start new diets or exercise regimens. I have to be completely honest about myself on whether or not something is healthy for me and it can get pretty difficult. But back to the topic, I definitely have experience and can talk freely. My question to you is if there's something that I definitely need to say during the event? My bigger concern however is making sure that I'll be okay. I'm a strong person but I want to make sure that I won't get triggered or that I will know how to handle it.Should I talk about my experiences if it is going to trigger me?
Hi,So next week, I have four job interviews. Probably more to come. Which is great, right? Wrong. I've just started recovery a few months ago and my BDB and Mia are still flaring up. I'm terrified of how I will look in the interviews and that my clothes won't fit (I'm scared to even try them on). I can't focus on my interview answers, the skills or knowledge I'm bringing in, any of it. All I can think about is how little progress I've made in recovery. I don't want to admit it, but it's led to some serious restricting ever since the phone calls started. Started purging again today and God help me I don't want to go down this path again.The worst part? I'm a psychotherapist. I should know better. They're psychotherapists, and I'm convinced they'll know and think I'm incompetent because of my inability to cure myself.Help? Please?How can I get the courage to try on my interview clothes?How can I let go of evaluating my recovery progress?How can I be comfortable with how I look?How can I not worry about judgements?How can I get out of this cycle?
Reddit, my best friend of three years has had an ED far before I've known them. I was so oblivious until I joked about it one day, saw their extremely off-put reaction and began noticing all the typical signs: excuses for not being hungry despite them spending entire days on urbanspoon looking at pictures, googling pictures of food, more time fiddling with food than eating it, being particular about food not touching and then refusing to eat it because it wasn't the way "they liked it", CONSTANT comments about their weight, and thinking any comment about their appearance was a direct comment to how fat they've become.About a month after noticing all the direct signs, I confronted them and of course, was greeted with lots of attitude and denial despite my very calm and understanding demeanor. For a while, I felt that it was important to bring it up about once a month in order to remind them that despite my knowing, I was caring to them, still cherished the friendship, and that I was still willing to be there for them in case they ever wanted to do anything about it. I began a hobby of ours to try new restaurants every week to encourage them to find the passions and joy that can come from eating, and we have been going strong. This has been happening for two years.Fast forward to today. Right now we are roommates, and I try my hardest to never allow their ED to become how I identify them, because despite it all, I know they are human and my dear friend. It's come to the point where even after strongly suggesting alternatives to the starvation, with things like therapy, group support, they still refuse strongly, still continue starving themselves, and has continued to watch their own health deteriorate before their eyes - cessation of the menstrual cycle, hypothyroidism, severe nutrient deficiency, thinning of the blood, thinning of the hair, hair falling out, dry and crackled skin, extreme sensitivity to changes in temperature, "greying" of the skin, and only then to say it's because of their "genetics", despite the other five members of their family having perfect health. I've brought it up to their parents only to be responded with a very high level of respect, but still extreme denial from both parents.Reddit, I'm a 20 year old male college student with a lot more on my plate than my friends ED - engineering school, an internship, and a part time music job that demands lots of my time for practice in order to pay bills. At this point today, I feel so ready to just draw the line and call it quits, because I feel that I've done everything I can do, and that if they aren't willing to open up their ears to anybody's help, even from their best friend, then there's nothing I could do to change their ways. It's become so severe to the point that my friends whom I have around the house have begun to notice and will make unintentional comments, leaving my best friend to feel more insecure and defensive (accusing me of sharing it with everyone) even though I've kept the ED to extreme discretion and have only told my mother who is in the medical field to ask for her guidance. I care so much for them, but in the end, feel that I need to look out for myself now that I feel like it's beginning to take an effect on my emotional health, but don't know if that's even the right thing to do. I don't feel that it's fair that they want to just use me for my friendship, but never address the real problems that true friends have the ability to discuss like adults.I reach out today because I have no experience with this, and need the perspective of someone who has dealt with this before. I'm desperate, I'm confused, and more importantly, I feel so defeated that even with my extreme patience (it may sound cocky, but I know that I've been abundantly patient), I haven't been able to get them to even take the first step to treating this, let alone even have them acknowledge it. I'm still treated with adamant denial, extreme close-mindedness, and I need help other than my own. Am I bad friend for wanting to move on? What should I do?
I'm a 23 year old female who has been binging and purging for 8 years now. I am tired, my body doesn't work the way it should, and I hate it so much. I am so scared of myself, but have no idea how to get myself to stop.I want to get help - I need to get help - but this is something I can just not afford. Living in Nebraska, I have not been able to find a low income or free support group or therapist to help me out. I feel so stuck.I don't know what to do. I feel completely helpless. I'm tired of being a slave to binging and purging, it's really ruined my life. I've already lost the love of my life and friends because I could not stop. I'm extremely afraid I'm going to lose my own if I am unable to.What should I do, reddit? I just want to be better.
My friend has had BN and Exercise Bulimia for longer than I've known her. The unspoken rule between our group of friends was that we wouldn't talk about weight, exercise, counting calories, nutrition, or even good food places we found because it would trigger her to purge shortly after. (I'm not sure if this was a healthy approach, but we were young and had no idea how to handle this.)Now, we are in our mid 20's and she's finally opened up to me about this part of her life. I want to do anything I can to help her, but I have no idea how to act. I LOVE food. My insta is all #foodporn and I'm one of those avid Yelp girls. I know that normally, I would be all over lunch and hyper-excited to eat. I'd take tons of pictures and act like it was Christmas Day over a cup of froyo. Every bite is "Ohhh GOOODD that's good."My question: Is my normal self appropriate for this situation? If not, how should I act? The last thing I want to do is to trigger her or make herself feel badly about herself. We are going with other girls in her recovery program and the friends they invited as well. Thanks!
Please excuse my ignorance. I assume that anorexic periods must be associated with personality changes of some kind, but I have no idea whether that's what's going on with my best friend. Any advice appreciated!I have been close friends with Rochelle (not her real name) for 15 years. I met her after she had already recovered from a previous anorexic period in her life (I believe she was diagnosed, she told me it was definitely anorexia). In the time I've known her she's tended to struggle with tending to be overweight, but overall she had a pretty healthy relationship with food and exercise (something she's always been proud of).In the past six months she's rapidly lost a great deal of weight (I'm sorry, I'm really bad at guessing others' weight, but maybe 70 lbs?) and is now underweight, similar to the photos she showed me of her previous anorexic period. She tells me she lost this in a healthy way, and I haven't pushed the topic (especially because she makes remarks about others where it seems that any comments on her weight changes by anyone seem to be interpreted as hostility) but it seems visually like an extreme change to me. I would not like to "stick my nose in where it doesn't belong," but her personality has changed, as well. Some of this has been good, for example, while she has dated on and off before, she would often withdraw from the dating world because she felt unattractive at her weight. Now she feels confident to really jump into the dating pool. She has also started socializing much more heavily with acquaintances, but on the down side, she has been treating me, her closest friend for all these years...frankly, like chopped liver. I feel that she has become inconsiderate, cold, and even maybe more shallow (she was always very philosophical, considerate and warm-hearted, and now I don't see much of any of that anymore). I did confront her about her changed behavior to me and it did not go well (she apologized and then continued the behavior with no change, and when I pointed that out, she got upset at me that I expected her to "change all at once" - actually, the sudden change WAS the problem!) Now our friendship is hanging by the thinnest thread. I feel very insulted by the way she's started treating me, I wouldn't tolerate it from someone without our shared history. I can't figure out if this is temporary (like maybe even literally caused by not eating?) and I should stick it out, or the "new her" (maybe since she said she feels that her weight loss is healthy and good, she associates me with "the past"?) and I should remove her from my life.Is this personality change likely related to her dramatic weight loss or probably not related? If it is related, is there anything I can do or say, or is this all out of my hands?Thank you!
We've been dating for almost a year now and we love each other a lot. I've been hiding an ED I've had for years. While I'm mostly recovered it's still a central aspect to each day and I really want to tell him about it.However, he's overweight (while I'm on the smaller side) and I don't want him to think that I care about his weight, by extension, because I don't. I know he's really self conscious about his weight but he never directly brings it up, and I don't want to make him feel worse.TLDR; Is it insensitive to tell a person who is much larger than you that you think you're fat and have issues with food?
I managed to overcome bulimia a few years back, still get the urge to purge every once in a while but I don't give in. However, I still have some physical symptoms that never went away such as cold hands, dry skin, fatigue, baggy eyes, sensitivity to cold, low libido (I think I even made a post here about cold hands a long time ago). A lot of the symptoms line up with hypothyroidism, so I was wondering if permanent thyroid damage can be caused by ED (google is fuzzy on this). Does anyone have a similar experience?
I'm a 31 year old woman with an eating disorder. I recently developed bulimia as result of many stressors in my life, including whether or not to leave my alcoholic husband and coming to terms with an abusive, narcissistic mother. Couple that with unhappiness at work and Bulimia ensued.I want help. I do not want to live life this way. The question I want to ask the sub is that, I've been doing some online reading which tells me to listen to my emotions when I feel hungry or to take a walk or take my mind off of things. None of that works. I just get even hungrier and hungrier until I cant stop thinking about food and then I go on a bingeing tirade. Only to feel guilty and disgusted by myself. To then throw it all up. TO finally feel satisfied and empty and in control. To then feeling guilty and like pure shit because of what my life has become.My question is: how does one distinguish between feeling and hunger? How can I work on that skill. To me, everything is hunger. I'm "hungry" an hour after I eat, I feel hungry all the time and when I am not eating I feel like I am starving myself all the time.Anyway, I am on this sub because I need help. I want to end this vicious cycle and I need resources, books to read, and support from other women (especially older women) who have overcome this terrible disorder.
I was a heavy kid, never truly fat, but always right at the cusp of being overweight, and I was very, very aware of it, thanks in large part to my parents. I have always had anxiety and and ADHD-PI and have struggled on and off with depression. My biggest fear was people being aware of my awareness of it, if that makes any sort of sense.I went a day without eating at age nine, but I was afraid of anyone finding out, so I suppressed that part of me. I pretended for years that nothing was wrong. I stopped eating meat at age twelve, started obsessing over fruits and vegetables, and became fairly thin. I got heavy again from age 13-15, largely through weird hypnotic binges after school. From 15-17 I half-deliberately lost a not-insignificant amount of weight, slowly so that no one would catch on. But they did, and they started making comments. Even though they're flattering, they make me extremely uncomfortable and they cause me to obsess over my appearance and my weight. I'm 18 now, and for the last six months I've been restricting calories for no particular reason and weighing myself multiple times a week (a big change from when I was a child and hid illnesses for months on end so I wouldn't have to see a doctor). Some days I eat almost nothing, little more than some snacks.When I'm around people I can shut it off and eat normally so that they won't suspect anything, but it stresses me out and makes me feel guilty when I have no choice but to eat 3 real meals a day. Since this summer, I've lost the same amount of weight as I did in 2 years before. When people ask me about it I deny everything and look at them like they're crazy. I don't like to talk about it, and I don't like it when other people talk about their own weight loss. I'm still nowhere near underweight (very average for an 18 year old girl) and I've never made myself throw up (because I tried it once years ago and couldn't do it), but I often have the urge to. I don't think I fit the clinical parameters for any officially recognized eating disorders, but I know I have a problem because I want my habits to be a secret. I know this sub isn't a doctor, but I don't know what to think. Everything I said is true, but the label "eating disorder" seems like an exaggeration. I know I don't obsess as much as other people do and that my behaviors aren't as extreme. Do I need help?
Over the last few months I've been getting progressively less and less hungry. I noticed it during Christmas dinner when I got a plate and put hardly any food on it, and then hardly touched the food. I ended up going from that to undereating because I forced myself to. I decided I should try to regulate my eating patterns so I got a meal today. I ate a few bites before feeling like I was going to puke. I had to throw it away because I couldn't eat anymore. This isn't an eating disorder is it?? I'm really scared that it is, because I didn't even realize how bad it was getting. Someone please help me :(
I have been pre-occupied with my weight since I was 13. I just turned 54. I have gained and lost the same 20-30 pounds countless times. I have never made myself vomit, but I have wanted to do so many, many times and I attempted it in my teens and 20s, but was never able to succeed, so I quit trying. I don’t have a history of going on “fad” diets, but I did have a few episodes in those early years of doing some really unhealthy things in my attempts to lose weight.In the last 20 years, I have attempted to control my weight in a healthy way by counting calories and setting a reasonable goal while eating a well-rounded diet of lean meats, fresh fruits and vegetables, and nuts. I’m not overly rigid and I allow myself to have treats on occasion. If it’s someone’s birthday, I have cake. If it’s a holiday, I enjoy the meal. Sometimes I can succeed at my goal, but more often than not, I lose control (at some point) and begin a cycle of daily binge-eating.The binge eating usually takes one of two forms. Sometimes, I know it’s emotional and I am seeking comfort, so I “drown my sorrows” in food and I just snack mindlessly. Sometimes, I feel genuinely HUNGRY, so I eat an apple or a healthy snack and I wait…but I am STILL HUNGRY. When this happens, I try to have some protein or a high fat snack like cheese, nuts, or almond butter. After this…I wait to see if the hunger subsides. If it doesn’t then I’m heading for a full blown binge and I will eat anything I can find until I am stuffed and miserable. Just one of these episodes can kick off a cycle that will last for weeks or months. My binge eating always takes place in private. I hide the evidence and I lie about food that has disappeared.I never thought I had an eating disorder because I don’t fit the profile for bulimia (I don’t purge) or anorexia. I recently learned a bit about Binge Eating Disorder and I seem to fit that profile rather closely. When I’m in a binge eating cycle, I am full of guilt and self-hatred. My weight balloons rapidly and I may gain 20 pounds in 3 months or less. I realize that my happiness and self-esteem is inextricably tied to my current weight.I feel silly coming to this realization at my advanced age. I am currently at a normal BMI, but I’m also counting calories in hopes of losing about 10 pounds, because “THEN” I’ll be happy. (HA! That’s how it’s always been!)I haven’t had a binge eating episode in about 5 months. What does this mean? Am I “in remission”? Does remission exist for BED? I don’t think I’m “cured” because I know I could relapse at any time.Where do I go from here, now that I'm 99% sure that I have BED? I haven't seen a professional and I wonder if I will be taken seriously since I am currently at a normal weight and I'm not currently engaged in binge eating. If I make an appointment to see someone, what should I look for to find a qualified professional?Thanks.
When I was 10ish, I was overweight. I saw an unflattering picture of myself, was horrified with my weight, and tried to change that. Looking back, part of me thinks that what could be seen as anorexia was really just me wanting to loose weight and having absolutely no proper information about how to do it. Eventually, I was in the "healthy" weight range. Anyways, I saw a psychologist, and within about a month I was doing better (thus my hesitation to say I was anorexic).Now, I'm 16. When I had blood tests done I had pre-diabetes, high cholesterol, etc. I started eating healthier and some of these numbers went down. I was still in the overweight range then. The numbers went down but still weren't healthy. Then I started to lose weight. I'm still losing weight in the "healthy" way, IE eating healthy foods & enough calories to be healthy and not excessive exercise. I use a calorie tracker and worry that I might be getting in an unhealthy way. For example, if I go over the calorie limit, I "roll over" those calories into the next day so that I eat less on that day because I don't want the numbers to say that I'm not meeting the calorie goal. I never go under the lowest recommended amount, yet. I need to lose weight because of my heart health, but I'm worried if I have an eating disorder again?
Hi Reddit. I was diagnosed with BED last year, which was somewhat of a relief, because I didn't know what was wrong with me. My weight has increased a lot in the past two years, and the time has come to do something about it.Many of my family members think I should go to slimming world as it means I can eat as much as I want of their approved foods. I've been to slimming world and weight watchers,and I've always failed after a few weeks/months. I'm anxious about going back, because I don't want to fail again, but it always happens, even when I want to lose weight.I also considered trying to change my eating habits by making small changes. I wonder if maybe slimming world or weight watchers doesn't work because it's overwhelming having to change so much. I'm aware I might also be kidding myself and that changing my whole eating pattern is inevitable.I guess I just want some advice. Has anyone else with BED got advice on losing weight? Or does anyone have any advice on what I should do?
So my girlfriend posted a disturbing message to her tumblr a few days ago and I'm not sure what to do or where to turn, or if this is the right place to send this to. I love her like crazy.. I'm so worried and scared for her. I knew something was wrong but I didn't know it was this bad. For example she drinks tons of water so she fills up and doesn't eat as much..Mod Note: The post request had the full tumblr post. The message is probably not so safe to post here in its entirety, but it would sound familiar to those of you who are familiar with AN. It describes in detail her negative self-image, particularly body image, strictly enforced limits on the amount of calories she allows herself, the amount she exercises, and the fact that she sees food as an enemy and something to be avoided. She specifically points out the pressure she feels to be thin when she sees images of models in magazines. She is a High School senior. She addresses her relationship with her boyfriend (the OP) thus:*" Speaking of which, i do have a wonderful boyfriend who is helping me through it all, and it irritates me that no matter how many times he tells me i’m beautiful and that he loves me the way i am and that i should basically fuck society, i can’t get the gnawing thoughts out of my head. The voices that keep telling me that i’m fat, they’re also the ones that tell me i’m not good enough for him. I wish i was good enough. I feel like i have to be a certain size to be good enough for him, even though i know its not true."*
I really dont know where to turn. It seems like I wont let myself go to the doctor because of my schedule.I feel insane; I dont know where to start without jumbling it all up. I am 27 years old but i believe i have had an eating disorder for over 10 years. I guess it comes and goes except i really notice it this time.I dont always feel comfortable preparing food around people so this prevents me from eating sometimes.I know i would be eating very healthy and on my way to weight gain if i was allowed to prepare food in my room but i have forbidden from doing that ever since my EX broke up with me and I moved in with my widowed grandma.I think everyone in my family believes i am still 13 and when i say i dont feel comfortable preparing food in the kitchen they think i am being a spoiled, manipulative brat and a picky eater.Anyway; I know it would go A LONG WAY in convincing my family that i am not a piece of shit brat trying to get my way if i had a doctor give me a note saying i have an eating disorder.My living situation really sucks which is one of the reasons why i stay in my room. I get no light in my room at all, so it is really hard to wake up... I would LOVE to go to the doctor like a normal person but i am Late everyday day for the past year which makes me feel very uncomfortable and guilty asking for any time off. In addition to that I always avoid my lunch so i can seem like i am working harder.By the time i get off work most doctors offices are closed as far as i know. I call around but i can only call when driving because my room gets no reception neither does my office.Everywhere i have managed to get ahold of tells me they arent the right doctor for that. Or they cannot diagnose the disorder. I've been to eating disorder treatment places but they cannot diagnose either.I dont know what to do. I am too depressed to drive miles away from my house to call doctors.. All the doctors i can go to are all closed when i am free.I literally own my weight in food, right next to me. But it is uncooked and unprepared. I wish i could eat it but i am forbidden from doing anything with it in my room. It has been like this for months and i just sit in my room and starve and cry.
I have an opportunity to reach out to a few mentors for recovery. What specifically do you think I could ask for in terms of assistance?What do you look for in terms of support?
Hi!Ive struggled with an ED for the past 17 years. I am now recovering and am a healthy weight. I have come a long way but am still in the recovery stage. I am 28 years years old and my husband and I are thinking about having a baby. I know I'm getting older and don't want to wait too much longer, but am so fearful about what pregnancy will do to me mentally and physically. I do not want to be triggered and relapse and I want to be able to "enjoy" the pregnancy.I am so scared of what pregnancy will do to me and my recovery. I fear the changes to my body both before and after pregnancy. I am struggling to accept myself now where I'm at, so how will I be able to handle a lot that comes with pregnancy and having a baby? I really want to say I can do it and will be able to handle it, and I hate to think this ED will rob me of something else in my life! Any advice from others on how they handled pregnancy and their attitude toward body changes during and after? Any advice or thoughts would be so helpful!
For the past few weeks at least, I have heard my sister often talk to my mum about her almost-seven-year-old being fussy about food- for example, she won't even eat [certain food] or we got her to eat [certain food] the other night. Today we visited my sister, and this is what I gathered from the conversation:* that she hasn't even been eating jelly over Christmas, even though she usually loves jelly* that one day she did eat 3/4 of a Weet-Bix- after my sister didn't watch and said she would like to "be surprised" every time she checked back, and bribed her with dying her hair (like her older sister) and that if she ate the Weet-Bix, she could choose what the whole family had for dinner (she chose McDonalds).* My niece had been complaining and crying of a stomach-ache one day, and seemed to think it was caused by food (though it was most likely caused by no food). My sister used reverse psychology and said "okay, I'm not going to make you eat anything today" and suddenly my niece seemed happy as Larry.I know that many kids are picky about what they eat for various reasons and that they will often go through phases like this.. but the reason I'm writing here is that I heard her say "I love being a skinny bitch!" twice, and after hearing about her food issues, I made a link. I don't know too much about what is actually going on with her eating, only little snippets here and there when my sister talks to my mum, and it could be that she's just repeating something she heard on TV. And I'm not sure exactly how common EDs are in young children. But do you think I have cause to be concerned about this/say something to my sister?
Can anyone recommend any books or other media (podcasts, movies, blogs, etc.) about recovery from eating disorders?Specifically any that focus on the "control" aspect of it.I actually have a different illness (OCD), but i am finding eating disorder stories sound very familiar, so maybe eating disorder recovery stories could be helpful.
I don't know where to start. I was overweight for a decade. It never bothered me. Not even a little. Suddenly, I lost a very large amount of weight. To the point that I was underweight. I was diagnosed with Graves Thyroid Disease, which for me, the onset was extreme. Also, with the disease, you're always extremely hungry, and can eat whatever you want around the clock, and you're still losing weight. So for four months, I ate nothing but junk and in huge amounts. Everyone smothered me with compliments.  And then I got diagnosed, and went on medication to slow down my thyroid. I should also mention that while people were showering me with praise, I was really sick. My hair was falling out, I was having panic attacks every night, extreme palpitations, the whole nine. I was at high risk for cardiac arrest the whole time I was undiagnosed. That's Graves, and it's horrible.Anyways, my thyroid slowed down. I gained a little weight back, but I was still a healthy weight for my height. It didn't bother me. Fast forward about six months. Suddenly, it was like a light bulb lit up. I decided I wanted to lose the weight I'd gained. I set a goal weight for myself and started exercising, and counting calories with one of those stupid phone apps. So I did that for awhile, and approached my goal weight. For some reason, that wasn't good enough. I set a new goal weight. When I got to that one, that wasn't good enough either. I was weighing myself obsessively. I stopped exercising, lost all energy. I saw where this might be going, so I stopped calorie restricting. I started eating whatever I wanted.I went to the Endocrinologist, and found out to my surprise, that the Graves disease, which is autoimmune, successfully destroyed my thyroid. Which means, I am hypothyroid, and my metabolism is way slower than a healthy person's. That thought makes me panic. I'd only gained back a tiny amount of weight, I'm still slightly underweight. I started on thyroid hormone replacement therapy two weeks ago. All I think about is food, and my weight, but I still eat junk when I feel like it...only to feel deep regret afterward. It's like there's something wrong, and I know it, but I'm refusing to let it stop me from eating what I want. Yet, it's always on my mind.My question is...what's happening to me? What did happen? I was overweight for years and it didn't bother me one bit. Even when my mother was pointing it out and telling me how unattractive I looked. I knew she was just being horrible, and I felt perfectly comfortable in my own skin. I was a healthy weight up until I graduated high school, and then I started taking a certain medication that caused me to become overweight, and I wasn't bothered by that, either. I feel like most girls would have been horrified, but not me. I was okay. So...can I get some feedback about this? And how to stop myself from going down this road? I feel like when this hypothyroid thing got thrown into the mix, it made everything so much worse. I'm always thinking about eating and not eating. I better go back to restricting my intake because I could be paving the road to being overweight again. Which, to me, seems like a nightmare if it were to happen. I don't get it. I really want to stop thinking about food so much, I really want to stop constantly examining my legs to see if they've gotten any bigger, and checking to see if I can still feel my hip bones...I've successfully stopped weighing myself every day, but that's about it. My husband, who is wonderful and loves me very much, keeps telling me that I could be three times my size and he'd still love me to pieces. It's not that I want to impress anyone by being so small, I don't need to. It's just me, something going on with me. What do I do? What is this?
I've been vegetarian since before my ED, but now I'm considering becoming vegan or at least cut out raw dairy and eggs. My boyfriend doesn't think it's healthy for someone in recovery to cut out whole food groups like that. Advice?A note from the mods: Please remember when replying that there are no "bad" foods. Keep it positive. 
Hi everyone. My girlfriend is the subject of this post.In high school, she struggled greatly with an eating disorder. She's overcome the physical parts of the disorder (no longer at an alarmingly low weight) but she still suffers greatly from the mental aspects.While she doesn't purge nearly as often (about once every three months), she is obsessed with her body image and eating the "right" food. If she eats something she doesn't deem as okay (chips, candy, carbs, etc), she feels extreme guilt. She is often very depressed despite taking Prozac. Most importantly, she thinks she is fat and wants to be "10 pounds" thinner. She is at a very healthy weight and does not need to lose any weight. That's not me wearing rose-tinted glasses, either. Her body is healthy.I would really love to guide her to a healthier path. I wish she didn't need to experience the guilt or have the constant struggle of becoming an unhealthy weight. I'm very grateful that she doesn't purge as often but I'm convinced that there must be some resources for her. She currently sees a therapist once a week. She was going to see a nutritionist but it conflicted with her work schedule.Is there anyone out there who has overcome something similar? I would love to hear from you. She has such a good life in front of her and I really want her to be able to experience it to the fullest.How can I help her be comfortable with herself as she is? How can I help her recognize that she is a healthy weight and that's great?Thank you so, so much for taking the time to read this.

I'm new to reddit but I'm interacting with /r/EatingDisorders/ because I’m near my wit's end. I’m in my early 30’s, and my wife of nearly two years is in her late twenties. She’s the most important person in my life, and the only reason I bring this up is two-fold: I’m concerned she might be jeopardizing her health If she really does have an ED, I want her to seek treatment before we start having kids.I knew before we got married that she struggled with anorexia when she was in college, however, I rationalized it because she was an academic overachiever, so the idea that she would skip a meal to continue working on homework wouldn’t seem ‘out of character.’ She saw a shrink, and that was that. Also, by the time we started dating, her eating habits seemed relatively normal. Her body weight was “petite but not skinny.”That said, during the time we dated, she did lose some weight, which I chalked up to the fact that she and I were both eating healthily, exercising, etc. Her BMI eventually leveled out.I noticed that she used the bathroom several more times than me per day. She also uses the bathroom with the faucet running, which she explained is due to the fact that she can’t use the toilet without such sounds (I’ve heard this is a fairly common problem in young kids). When I’ve asked her about her frequency or duration the answers are usually GI-tract related (i.e. constipation or diarrhea).One time she took a long time with the shower turned on (in the middle of the day). I basically intimated that I was concerned she was vomiting. She said, no, she was showering. At this point, I lost it because her hair was dry. She said she was shaving her legs… which was true.Another time we ate ethnic food, which she liked at the time, but afterwards she started feeling “very nauseous.” We went home and she definitely pulled the trigger (the noises were obvious and she admitted as much). I ate the same food, no problems.It seems like any very heavy dish gives her nausea.About 6 months ago, she admitted that yes, she was bulimic in college but that she hadn’t been for the last several years.Everything seemed fairly normal until last weekend. She ate like a bird for several days. Then we go to a restaurant and we eat a heavy meal. Afterwards, about 4 hours and one layover later, she starts complaining of nausea on our 2nd flight, because of “the aircraft's motion,” and wants to go to the bathroom. Mind you we’ve flown tens of thousands of miles together with nary a problem. I say, “here, drink some Ginger Ale, it’ll help settle your stomach.” She refuses to drink any. After a while, I ask her if she’s okay, and she says yes.When we get home, she almost immediately goes to the bathroom, closes the door, turns the water on. I ask, “are you still nauseous?” she says, “I’m taking care of it.”When she gets out, I’m pretty despondent. I waited too long to write this, so I don’t remember either of our exact words, but I made it pretty clear that her behavior was pretty indicative of bulimia, she was livid, “if I was bulimic, wouldn’t my breath smell?” “If you’d kept it on the downlow for two years, wouldn’t you have developed a pretty good method of masking the smell.” Nothing good came from our exchange.Basically, I’m at the point where there are one of only a few possibilities: 1) she’s bulimic, but unwilling to let me know (possible) 2) she’s got a health problem, but is unwilling to get treated (possible, she hates doctors) 3) she’s got a paranoid husband who thinks her wife is bulimic (possible, but unlikely)Do I: a) Try to bring up the subject again, likely provoking another fight with profuse denials? b) Pretend that everything is fine, until she decides to seek out help (which would create a serious rift in our relationship)? c) Do I show her irrefutable proof that she’s got an ED, and work from there?I’m basically ruling out any suggestions involving my mother-in-law. We get along very, very well, but my wife takes great offense at any suggestions or concerns her mother raises.None of the evidence alone is a smoking gun, but you add it all up, and I don’t think my concerns are irrational: History of ED Frequent restroom usage Always loud, running water complaints of nausea after big and/or fatty meals refusal to see doc for symptoms cavities perfectionist when it comes to physical appearanceWhat things don’t fit: No negative self-talk (I’m fat, I should lose weight, etc) No obvious enamel loss (I asked our family dentist if he noticed anything unusual about her teeth, he said no) Don’t hear vomiting (is it possible to puke quietly?)
Hey everyone.Big news! I found out I was pregnant about a month and a half ago. Along with all the normal nervousness surrounding a first pregnancy, I realize that I'm going to start struggling tremendously with body image issues, mood swings, and the diet changes that are normal among pregnant women, but could easily lead to disordered eating.I'd really like some advice from people who have gone through this before. I have some specific things that are concerning me right now, which I'll list below.1. Despite being fairly early along, I'm starting to get that uncomfortably-full feeling despite eating a normal amount of food. This sensation is usually what triggers purging, and it ends up floating in the back of my mind until the feeling passes. This is only going to get worse the further along I get. Does anyone have any coping mechanisms for this that have worked for them?2.  I often find myself hyper-focusing on "pregnancy superfoods" and the "right" things to eat. Restricting or eliminating certain foods has always been the hardest thing for me to get past, and having this constant barrage of "You should eat this, you shouldn't eat that" from pregnancy websites is typically what we need to avoid. Should I simply ignore this advice and go back to my normal eating patterns(which have helped me avoid disordered eating in the past)?3. Food cravings are hitting me like a freight train, and they seem to occur at the same time as serious mood swings. Several times now I've bought foods that I know are triggering for me, with the rationalization that, "Oh, I'm pregnant, it's okay. And I'll only eat a little to get over the craving." Obviously it is not working out that way. Is there a middle ground that works for you? I want to get to a point where I can indulge some cravings without losing control and spiraling into the desire to purge.Thank you in advance and all your advice. Anecdotes are very welcome.
I have always been small-built, ever since I could remember. I was able to get to a slightly higher weight when I was on the pill.  Due to medical reasons, the last two years I have been off the pill I have gone back to what I see as my 'usual' weight. Over the last six months, my Dr has put I am anorexic on my file and I have upped my eating by double. I snack a lot during the day, drink high calorie drinks and of course, there was Christmas. However, nothing is having any effect. I have been to counselling for the last six months as well and through a lot of discussions, I hold no need to be 'skinny' and desperately want to put on weight.So despite upping my calories by a lot, I am seeing no physical improvements. Have you got any suggestions on how to progress? I feel like I am at a dead end.
To start things off, I've always been a fairly underweight individual. About 9 months ago I started looking into options to gain weight as I was going through some personal issues that wanted me to change up my life. However, around mid-August I ended up getting sick (food poisoning is the suspect) and ended up not eating for nearly 2 days. I recovered and moved on but my appetite did not; before I would have to remind myself to eat but it would get done. Now I can barely stomach a meal and eating itself is a chore. I can go a while without food and not even realize it, if I don't set alarms then it sometimes happens. The past three days have been the worst, I haven't consumed much and have lost weight, as someone who doesn't weigh enough to afford to having that happen. What should I do? This is appearing more and more like an onset of anorexia and I'm worried. Meals will get started and not finished, I'll go a while without eating and my stomach aches yet I can't bring myself to eat. The thought and actions of it make me nauseous. Any advice welcome, I'll be the first to admit I have no idea what to do here.
Hello! I am a late-twenties male, and underweight for my height and sex. I have a history of anxiety and panic. Symptoms of these disorders are for the most part extinguished (I occasionally experience symptoms of high anxiety -- nausea in particular is my panic trigger), but one thing that has stuck around is my tendency to limit food intake/lose my appetite during stressful periods as a way to regulate my fear and anxiety (especially of nausea). I have been fairly thin all my life, but lately I've been experiencing a lot of work-related stress and my schedule has not been conducive to the longer periods of eating I sometimes need to get enough calories, thus the weight loss.I know I am underweight right now, and I very much want to gain the weight back (and then some), but I'm having a lot of difficulty figuring out how to do this. I suspect my anxiety-sensitivity, and fear of panic/nausea are related to the difficulty I'm having gaining weight, but aside from the weight loss these are for the most part non-issues in my life.Is there a treatment for this? I'd love to have some professional help and support with this!
Hello, I am a female in my mid 20s who is struggling with binge eating. I recently thought I had it under control, but I have been slowly slipping and I have dropped to a new low this week. I am considering reaching out for help from a dietician/counselor specializing in binge eating, but I have some reservations that keep me from seeking help:-I have gotten help before from therapists and from a support group. I have no trauma i need to work out, and the group I did not like because of the large age difference and the fact that they have been there for decades and have not changed. I know my eating is due to stress situations, incidents where i feel intense emotions (anger, shame, loneliness) or I am avoiding things, or I find myself surrounded by food and erroneously thinking I will be ok eating a triggering thing (and then things go down hill from there).I have difficulty implementing strategies to help me be proactive ( and I do sometimes make the choice to be self destructive because in that moment i wont care about my future). I'm not sure if help from others can help me anymore.-I notice that a lot of binge eaters do have past trauma they have not dealt with, or have chronic anxiety/depression/anxiety attacks, and that is not me. So I am unsure if I do actually have 'bad enough' disordered eating to seek help, or if I just need to pull myself up and cut the bull. That being said, I do know my binging hurts others (when I take out my anger on them) and I do tend to isolate myself when my appearance is not meeting my expectations-I do know for a fact I have trouble being completely truthful about how I feel, and about my actions (i have been told this by family, whose opinion i trust). I have had difficulty telling my parents about what I have been eating when I have been asked point blank, and I couldn't tell my sponsor either when i was in a support group, out of shame. I do want to be truthful, I try but then...I'm not. I'm aware of me having a tendency to be manipulative to protect myself , and of sabotaging my efforts to change (at least I'm aware of it).I just want to know if there are others that may have similar issues being completely truthful to themselves and others about their condition, of being manipulative ( in the sense of having a part of you that is keeping you from changing your habits completely), and what they have done to be more honest and hold themselves more accountable for their actions (accountability i also struggle with). Also, do you find dieticians/nutritionists as/more/less helpful than counselors, psychologists and social workers (LCSW's)?How do you guys get out a rut? I know I have it in me to change since I've done it before, but never for longer than a month and a half, and that was due to an ultimatum made by my family. I don't want to hurt them anymore (I take out the pain I feel after binges on them), and that is why i want prof. help, but I'm not sure if it can help me anymore, due to my past experiences.Thank you for listening
Right now, I've halfway escaped my eating disorder. 50% of my body wants to gain, while the other 50% enjoys the feeling brought when I count calories and make sure I don't "splurge" over what's necessary. I'm not at a deathly weight, I'm barely underweight, and I haven't lost any weight in the last 4 months, so I have plenty of time to think about whether or not I should seek outside help.The issue is this: I understand that the root of my anxiety isn't found in food, but rather a deeper issue altogether. Controlling my food intake has simply been a coping mechanism for a greater ordeal. I don't know what exactly this ordeal is yet, but I know it has something to do with my social health, which has plummeted since I graduated from high-school.I've never had any issues with food until I grew semi-depressed after my graduation, so I believe that if I attack the issue at the source, my eating disorder should just go away.I've gone 6 months now without discussing my troubles with anyone but the members of this subreddit. Venting through anonymous posts has been pretty therapeutic, but I'm starting to wonder if I need to seek a professional, a friend, or a relative for help. No one would have imagined that I've gone through so much stress every day, and I don't want to make my family worry, so I'm hoping that I can just solve my problems without having to drag anyone else into my mess. Is there a safe, anonymous way to seek therapeutic help? If my issue lies in social health, should I simply try to meet new people and see if things return to normal?
I am a new employee in a resident eating disorder treatment facility. I am going to eat dinner on nights I am working with the clients. As employees, we must try to interact with clients during meal times and also try to make them feel comfortable (the idea is so they won't be thinking too much about food or distraction). I am wondering what are some good conversation starters or topics for clients, so they will feel comfortable and be willing to conversation? Also, anything I should know or watch out for? 
I need help... I've never really talked about this but recently I realized how bad It's getting.. I have always struggled with weight, in 2010 I was overweight due to stress at college and ended up dropping out.. Fast forward a few years, I always told myself that I would never allow myself to get to that weight so I always watched myself and if I noticed weight gain I would watch how much I ate and often underate. I know It's not healthy but my body was managing it and I felt good so I didn't worry. I'm smart and in tune with myself so I figured I wouldn't let myself get sick. Anyway, over the summer I took about internship that was incredibly intense. I was working 10.5 hours days almost everyday so my lunch and breaks were limited (I didn't notice the weight loss until recently) when the internship was over I went home for a few weeks before college resumed and everyone I saw commented on how thin I was looking (not in a bad way, just different) I was Happy so I kept doing what I was doing, only really eating when I felt hungry ..which started to become less and less... When i was home i saw that things had gotten bad with my parents, and i was unfortunate enough to see my big brother in a heroin comatose. It haunted me.   I went back to college (5000 miles from my family) and then my friend died in September I hit insanity and didn't know what to do. Then a month a bit later I received a phone call from by parents with the horrific news my brother had died...I was broken. By this time I had lost a crazy amount of weight and food became disgusting to me. Every time I tried to eat something I felt sick, nothing could go down. The only time i stomached food was when I was smoking weed. Fast forward to yesterday, (Chrismas Eve) I was puking all day due to a bug and have lost even more weight. My parents have noticed and are consistently asking me if I've eating yet and things like that..I lie because I don't want them to worry. They just lost their son in the worst of ways and don't need to be worrying about their daughter but now they are worried.I really need advice on what to do... I really few that no one is going to take me seriously and tell me I'm just being stupid but I just can't stomach eating and I am fading.What should I do? Could there be a medical reason I'm not able to stomach eating?Would therapy help me with the recent deaths I've experienced?Should I be concerned I'm lying?Why is it I don't want to fade?Why is it I want someone to notice and help me? What does help from family and friends look like? Also side note: I'm the strong one, I've lost nine loved ones in the past few years, I live far from my parents, I'm very intune with my surroundings and help my friends with life everyday.
It is currently 2:27am on Christmas Day. I've been shuffling through my private tumblr (I keep it password protected) to see how I have recently been doing. I use it to vent and somewhat catalog myself for reference/monitoring.I should prefix this with the fact that I have never done anything like starving myself, purging, etc. I have always been a chubby girl, but I never truly considered it. Unfortunately I struggle with medical problems that prevent me from doing a lot of physical activities. I have tried to maintain a balanced diet, which I do most of the time, with the exception of the holidays.Now, I'm writing this because I am scared. There is no other way to describe it. I was ill last winter/spring and put on roughly twenty pounds. It has destroyed my confidence even more, but what is scaring me is my reaction to it. Initially I told myself I'd just go on a diet and lose it - even attending weight watchers with my grandmother for a short time, but I fell off that wagon due to a busy schedule and simply shit food supplies in my home.I keep telling myself that perhaps if I just don't eat for a while and drop the weight I can go from there and maintain what I've lost. As if starving myself for "just a short while" is reasonable and I recognize the absurdity within that idea, but the weak and confused part of me keeps screaming that it may work. I know EDs are not something you can switch off, but the illogical part of me keeps whispering that little idea to me.What I want to know is: is this a warning sign? Am I practically on the trail to developing? How do I save myself from myself when it comes to this?
So I'm not sure if this is the right place for this but I didn't know where else to go for advice.When I was a teenager I struggled with disordered eating. I'm now trying to channel this into eating healthily and exercising which is going well and I feel great, but I'm finding it hard to cope with some things. One of the main ones being how I feel when someone close to me loses weight/wants to lose weight. It sounds stupid but I start to panic thinking they're going to end up with an eating disorder even if they only want to lose a few pounds and it really gets to me.For example, my little brother has always been a bit overweight and has been dieting on and off for the past few years (he's 18 now) but I live away from home and don't see him often. In the past 2 months, he's lost a LOT of weight, and it's instantly sent me into panic mode. Instead of being proud of him I'm worried that he's going to develop an ED. I'm obsessing over what he's eating, if I feel like he hasn't eaten enough I feel like I have to remind him and I can tell I'm being really annoying but I can't help it. I'm constantly reminding him about proper nutrition and if he skips a meal, or eats less than me I start to get really anxious. It happens every time a person close to me loses some weight.How can I stop this from happening? Its affecting me quite badly, whenever I find out someones been losing weight I start worrying about it and won't stop comparing myself to them. It's even gotten to the point where if someone says they're going to start exercising, I secretly want them to stop because I'm worried they'll become obsessed. I'm such a hypocrite because I promote healthy eating and exercising but I worry whenever someone else starts to do it too! I hate feeling this way because I know it's pathetic and I want to have healthy feelings towards weight loss, is there anything I can do to stop having these feelings?

I don't have an eating disorder, but I have some really unhealthy coping mechanisms involving food. I have anxiety, I selfharm, I have mental issues up the wazoo basically. I am a healthy weight, but I tend to severely undereat during bad periods, feeling like it gives me control. I have never seen this as a big issue, and have downplayed it a lot.Last night while visiting my parents I had an AHA-moment, realizing how bad it has gotten. I think I might be endangering my health.So last night I decided to try and fix it, and ended up nearly with a panic attack while trying to eat dinner. I realized I have been lying to myself, and that maybe just 'cos my medical records don't say I have an ED on them, maybe I still do. At least a little.I am not trying to self diagnose here, what I am looking for is helpful advice; does anyone have some methods they can share for when they want to not eat, that makes them able to eat anyway?I want to beat this before it becomes a thing, and I am scared to death it might already be a thing. I don't weigh myself during bad periods 'cos I am scared of obsessing over the number, having an "ideal" number in my head that far below what I should be, and in the same vein I have been trying to not log my food intake, in case I should look at the empty page and feel good that it's empty.I downloaded a mealtracker app so that I would maybe a have calorie goal to reach each day, but that seems insurmountable today.So, does anyone have any suggestions that help me eat "normally"? I am willing to try nearly everything.
I'm 23 and stuck living at home while I'm in between jobs (I left my job to recover because I was a mess). I've struggled with BN with restriction for nearly 5 years. I'm in therapy and am doing very well--haven't purged in about 6 months, I'm eating balanced and regularly, and no longer have most of my food fears and rituals. At this point my biggest hurdle is my weight, which is still on the low side.My mom has this really triggering habit of basically self-lecturing ("I should really walk more during the day" "I should stop eating this candy right now, I've had enough") and her solution to this is that she thinks it would be super great (read: enabling her horrible self-lecturing tendencies) to have a Fitbit.I have a hard time explaining to her that when she talks that way that it's triggering to me, because it's hard to pinpoint exactly why, and also it's her life so I can't exactly tell her what to think and do.But I am really REALLY upset that my dad got this stupid thing for my mom.I'm terrified for Christmas morning, I am terrified of having this damn gift ruin one of my favorite holidays--I don't want everyone "ooh"-ing and "ahh"-ing over this ridiculously obsessive device. I don't want my mom constantly talking about it every day after as she uses it and tries to figure it out. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT LET ALONE BE AWARE THAT IT EXISTS AND IS BEING USED IN MY HOUSE.I am having a really hard time coping with this, and it's making me dread Christmas now, which is doubly upsetting for me. Does anyone have any advice on how I can deal with this? I wish I could just ask my dad to return the thing, or give it to her in private and not advertise it around me but I don't think either of them would even understand why this thing bothers me so much if I tried to talk to them.I had told my mom a few months ago that I thought the Fitbit was a bad idea and kind of triggering and her response was "Well I am not obsessive like you so it wouldn't be a problem for me" - literal words out of my (psychologist!) mother's mouth.Is there anything I can do about this? Or ways I can look at this so that it doesn't make me want to cry and feel like relapsing to spite my ignorant dad and insensitive mother?
Over the last 7 years, I went from being extremely underweight to obese. I am currently overweight and my physician wants me to lose weight. He knows of my prior anorexia and BED, but insists that I drop the weight to avoid complications with an autoimmune condition I have. The thing is, there is some type of mental block preventing me from really losing the weight. I exercise, but don't over do it. I eat healthy, but don't restrict. I almost feel like my recovery practices are now interfering with my health. Has anyone else dealt with something like this before?Should I listen to my doctor? Should I look for another? Advice? 
I have recently left an inpatient facility after going from a very low weight to a weight within the healthy range. I have been maintaining at this new, healthy weight for about a month now. At first my body image was 'okay', some days I even felt that I looked pretty good, but over the past week or so my body image has plumeted to the point where I can't look at myself in the mirror without seeing chubbiness and desperately wanting to restrict again. Has anyone advice for this? Feeling good at their setpoint / healthy weight at first but then falling into feelings of intense dissatisfaction later? I've only heard of it going the other way. Any advice would be much appreciated. I'm terrified of this sending me back into a relapse.
Some background: I've been dealing with EDNOS (or OSFED now, I guess) for 6 years. My family didn't know until I came clean and asked for support in recovery about 3 years into it. With the exception of some "hiccups," I've been pretty stable since 2012... except now I think I'm in the middle of a relapse that I wasn't even aware was happening.This past year was absolutely horrible. I moved 2 hours away for a job that turned out to be absolutely horrible and I can't seem to advance to a different branch. It's a high-stress job and some of my co-workers seem to get a sick pleasure in making my job harder for me. I tried to do everything I could to keep busy and keep my depression at bay - I joined a roller derby team (which is so much fun and filled with wonderful, supportive, kick-ass people). I wrote. I spent time with loved ones. I adventured around the city & surrounding areas. I thought I was ok.I moved to a new apartment recently and found my journal while unpacking. As I was reading journal entries, I realized I might be in the middle of a relapse that started this past August. I had gained a lot of weight since moving to my new city (before you say it: I only gained a little bit of muscle from roller derby), but looking back at these journal entries, I realized I had lost a significant amount of weight in a short amount of time and the stuff I've been writing for the past couple months are very similar to journal entries from 2008-2011. I write my calorie count in my daily planner... and I've been restricting since August. I'm at a healthy weight now, so everyone think I just lost the weight I gained when I moved here.I'm terrified because I've been able to realize old behaviors and squash them before they manifested. So how the hell did I realize NOW that I'm 4 months into a full-blown relapse? I feel ridiculous that this snuck up on me. And this time, I'm on my own insurance, which is complete garbage compared to my parents' insurance (which I was on back in 2012) and I can't afford any kind of treatment.Any advice on how to get out of this rut? Am I really that crazy to not notice this?
Has this happened to anyone else? I wont talk numbers, but I had a check up yesterday and was lectured about my BMI being too low, as well as my weight. I told my doc that I am not at my lowest weight, feel like I look bangin' (for once in my life!) and am eating in a way that is not restrictive (which is what I used to do). I also go to the gym in the week (I take a couple different classes, with breaks and snacks in between). I am strong, I am gaining muscle. I like my body now.Sure, every now and then the thoughts pop in. But I can fight them more often than not.But now I am feeling a bit paranoid that I am delusional or something? How seriously do I need to take this doctors lecture?(submitted by /u/we_will_be_fine)
http://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/resources/infopax.cfm?Info_ID=48I have been following this workbook for a little over a week. Since beginning, I have actually been able to overcome a binge twice (a feet I have never before accomplished in my 6 or so years of having the disorder).I also have a question. The workbook demands that the goal of the program cannot be weightloss, which discourages dieting obviously. However, I am a vegan for both health and ethical reasons. I know the veganism does not likely help my overcoming the disorder, but it feels so wrong to give it up. Do you think I must give up veganism to overcome the disorder? Or may I continue granted my goals are absolutely not weightloss?
Hey, I work on a paediatric ward where we get a lot of patients with eating disorders (predominantly teenage girls). I guess I was wondering if anyone who has had a hospital admission with an eating disorder would let me know what made their admission better or worse and what I can do to make my patients' lives easier in a really difficult time.Please notify the original submitter, /u/bon_jover , when you reply to this post.
I was in inpatient treatment about a year and a half ago. Left at a healthy weight, maintained for a while, still seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. Now I feel like I am back at square one; engaging in the old behaviors and feeling very, very depressed. But as of now, I'm not underweight. I feel like I NEED to be underweight to seek help. My ED started as somewhat a manifestation of my depression. And now that I am at a healthy weight, i feel like no one cares that I want to die. Because I am physically healthy, no one seems all too concerned with the fact that I am severely depressed and suicidal. My therapist keeps suggesting that i try to remain mindful and appreciative, but I truly feel like I have nothing to live for. How do you disassociate depression from an eating disorder?
Hi r/eatingdisorders, I need your help understanding how to best support my fiancée on her road to recovery. Last year she was diagnosed with bipolar depression. She was emotionally abused and bullied as a child and has low self-worth and body-image issues that developed into a full blown ED a couple months ago. She’s now in a partial hospitalization program with a mixed diagnosis (mainly anorexia though) and has a good treatment team, but there are a couple of areas where I could use some enlightenment.I've got 2 questions: I was a college athlete (recent grad) and I do a lot of weightlifting/fitness things. Basically, exercise is an important part of my life, so I was naturally happy and excited when my fiancée began coming to the gym with me and learning how to lift, etc. I thought it was something that could help her with the depression. At first it was enjoyable and fun for both of us, but as her ED got worse it became something that she started to obsess over and part of the problem. Given how central exercise can be to an ED, is it unlikely that my fiancée will be able to join me in fitness-related activities in the future? Can we exercise and stay fit together once she gets her ED under control, or will this always be an ED-related behavior for her and something that will inevitably lead to relapse? I imagine that this varies from person to person, but what’s the range?Second, I don’t really understand how the threshold for being underweight is calculated. I know BMI is one big measure and I took a look at the chart on the sidebar here, but it still seems a little... fuzzy. Now, I have been keeping a close eye on her and it was only in the month before she was admitted to the hospital that I became concerned about her actual weight (before that I was mainly worried about the behaviors: the restricting and obsession with exercise, and eventually purging). However, I know that her BMI has always put her at underweight, even though her BF% has been pretty normal. Her body type is tall and slender - it’s genetic and everyone in her family is as well.She’s gained back a significant amount in the hospital, but her dietitian says she’s still underweight even though it’s apparent to me that her BF% is now solidly back in a healthy range for someone her age. (It never did drop anywhere near a dangerous level, but it was lower than most and I was concerned it was starting to head in that direction just before she was admitted.) Her dietician seems to want to get her into the “average” range, where she’s never been before. So, what am I missing here? Is it not so much about the weight, and more about her eating habits and mental attitude? Does body composition matter, or is that irrelevant from an ED perspective or when recovering from an ED? If someone could point me to some reliable resources on this, I’d really appreciate it.
Hello All,I need some advice. I am twenty-eight and I have struggled with ED on and off since age twelve. My major relapse was at age twenty-seven and I finished treatment in May 2014. I was struggling for a while, but now I am eating healthfully, working with a nutritionist, haven't used a symptom in a long time, and finding normal again. I have noticed that my libido is still very low however. I am in a great relationship with a partner who has been nothing but wonderful and patient...and looks like a young Edward Norton to boot. ;) I wonder if it has anything to do with amenorrhea. During treatment, I had a cycle for the first time in three months. I had one more normal cycle in mid-May 2014 and then had a light bit of spotting during June 2014. I feel as if I have PMS from time to time, but still haven't had a real cycle since May. I have trouble...um...getting in the mood, so to speak even alone. Any ideas or suggestions? Has anyone else struggled even after recovery?
My roommate has recently been very stressed and upset with the revelation that her brother has been starving himself. She knows that I have been in recovery for an eating disorder (bulimia) for over two years now, and is looking for affirmation/advice. I really cannot think of any positive, sunny "It's all going to turn out great!!!!" advice to give her, because as many as you know, an eating disorder is pretty awful and soul-sucking for everyone involved- the one suffering from it, and those who love them, and even though many like me enter and stay in recovery, it is a long and hard road to get there. I'm not sure what to say as to how she should deal with this as an ally/loved one, because I was very, very secretive about my bulimia, and my friends and parents did not have a clue about the fact that I had been bulimic for almost five years until I went into therapy. Can anyone who has been in her position give me some advice on what to say to her, particularly something that will give her comfort or hope?
My teenager has a binge-purge ED and depression. She has been on antidepressants and sees a counselor and a dietitian. She took herself off meds and refuses to go back on antidepressants. Therapy has made no difference in her ED. She doesn't want to get better. As her parent, what is the next step in treatment of a teen who does not want help? How can I determine which residential treatment centers in my area are a good fit for her? How does a parent get a reluctant teen to go into residential treatment?
I am a 25 year old male who has been struggling with bulimia for the past 2 years. Recently, 2 months ago, the binging and purging stopped. But then immediately turned to the opposite extreme, restricting. Is this common? I have lost a lot of weight and now I am on the fast track to inpatient (I have been there before for bulimia) and am very worried. The problem is when I try to eat I literally start to feel sick to my stomach. Also after I eat I am overcome with a huge sense of guilt, a "oh god what have I done" kind of feeling," and it lasts for days. Is there a way to overcome that?Also where can I find guys my age that deal with the same issue's? I feel very alone being a young male with an ED. I tried opening up to my friends about it once and it got extremely awkward and they said things I wont repeat here.
Not much backstory is needed, but I should include a little bit I think. I've actually been binge eating for a couple of years now but didn't know I was. I was usually in front of the TV or my phone so I wasn't aware that I didn't want to be eating. I had no idea I couldn't control my eating. It wasn't until a few of months ago, after I began restricting, when I realized I had a problem.For the last few weeks, I've been practicing demand eating. I don't measure food or count calories anymore (if I do count, it's usually a really loose estimate), so I don't actually know how much I'm eating. I'm trying to focus more on getting in tune with my hunger signals, and learning to trust myself to feed myself, than I am with body image. It feels great, but the problem I've faced with this is that it never sticks for more than a few days before I binge.My question is, do binges stem from too little calories or not responding to your hunger? I'm not really hungry often because when I eat, I'm satisfied for a long time afterwards. I just don't understand why the binges keep coming if I rarely feel hunger and always try to respond to it when I do. Why do I binge if I always try to give myself what I want to eat?I'm really scared when I don't feel hungry. I start to think I truly am hungry but I'm in denial about it. And I'm scared if that's the truth that I will inevitably binge.Does anyone else who has gone through something similar have any insight to give? Thanks a lot!
Hey everyone,I was hoping to get some perspective from other members here. I'm a trans woman in my early 30s and am trying to become OK with the idea of reaching a healthy weight by no longer engaging in restricting eating behaviors. Unsurprisingly, the trans aspect of this whole thing complicates matters.I'm underweight right now, and the problem is that, despite my objections as a feminist to the notion that the one way to be attractive is to be unhealthily thin, I like the comments from friends and coworkers about how skinny I am, even while I understand rationally that being this thin isn't healthy.Now, one way being trans affects this is that, ironically, I know I'd look more feminine if I got up to a healthy weight--my face would look a little softer and more rounded, my body would take on a more feminine shape, etc. That's probably my primary motivation for recovery (and I'll leave aside for now the fact that conformity with hegemonic standards of femininity is kind of a sketchy motivation from a feminist standpoint).However, that motivation gets a little muted by the fact that I already get "read" as a girl pretty much all the time anyway, as far as I can tell. If people were calling me "sir" and "dude" and stuff, I'd probably feel a stronger push. Still, wanting to feel happier with what I see in the mirror--i.e., seeing less boy and more girl in my appearance--does feel like a good motivator.What's sparked a recent change in my thinking was when my friends stopped unexpectedly for ice cream and brought me peppermint bark ice cream, which they know I really like. I didn't eat it (they know about my eating behaviors and understood), but dude, it's the holidays, and peppermint bark rules. I think that just kind of made me think, "Wow, these restricting behaviors really, really suck, and I'm exhausted from dealing with them day in and day out."For the past couple of days, I've been experimenting with being less restricting in my eating habits, with the goal of "I'll just try this out, get to X weight [only a small change], and see how that feels." I've made progress toward that, and it turns out that it feels terrifying. I kind of want to curl up into a ball and cry.I'm scared of changes in my body from gaining weight, or comments from my co-workers (even though they're nice people who I doubt would really do that).I think I also am upset because, even though strangers look at me and see a girl, and even though I'm not that tall, I still think I've internalized the idea that women are supposed to be small and delicate (which, of course, is a harmful, anti-feminist notion that my conscious self objects to). I'm also shy and don't like being the focus of people's attention, and I think being thin helps me feel a little less likely to attract anyone's notice.Anyway, thanks so much for reading. Does anyone have any thoughts, perspectives, etc. you might have on dealing with this?
1) I find someone who I may be interested in. 2) My appearance in comparison to their beauty pretty firmly cements the idea that it would be ridiculous to imagine they would ever reciprocate, and if by some miracle they did, I would always feel inadequate and want to improve/diet/etc until I felt deserving. 3) I dwell on this. 4) Feelings of supreme worthlessness. 5) I overeat at the lower end of the spectrum or completely lose it and binge. 6) By doing so I have made no progress towards ever feeling good enough and end up self sabotaging my ultimate desires. 7) I am still attracted to that person or people and yet now I am post-binge, and worse off.This seems to be happening over and over. I want to improve. I want to feel good enough, deserving, and not have to worry about my appearance all the time.I am just having trouble breaking the cycle that seems to be an almost daily thing now.I would be grateful for any insight/advice.
Hello, my friend isn't doing well. She sees herself as fat, which she is far from. She eats very little and she throws up most of what she does eat. She is happy that people are noticing that she has slimmed down but it doesn't seem like she has any intention of slowing down or stopping. I've tried to get her to go to the doctors but she doesn't want to. What would you suggest?
I am a former bulimic/binge eater who has been facing a lot of digestion problems since my bulimia episodes. Doctors have yet to find anything delectably wrong with any aspect of my digestive system (recent ultrasound, gastroscopy 2 years ago). I am curious if anyone has any knowledge about damage that can be done to one's insides through bingeing + purging, in hopes that I can get some direction for a diagnosis. Symptoms include: bloating, pulsing headaches, fatigue, brain fog, and abdominal tightness, acid reflux, all which are exacerbated from eating.Thanks!
Should people with binge-eating disorders be drinking coffee? Is it just me or does coffee/caffeine really disconnect you from your true hunger signals? Thanks a lot
To everyone suffering from or recovering from an ED, please know that you're not alone this Thanksgiving. Remember to take things in moderation. It's probably the hardest day of the year for everyone with an ED, but we can all get through this! I'm thankful for what a supportive community this is, and all of you guys! Happy Thanksgiving :)
Hi /r/eatingdisoders, how goes it?I'm a female in my 20s, currently in a stressful point in my graduate school career. I also recently went through a painful breakup which has not helped my emotional state. On top of that, I have ADHD - I take Adderall XR every day in order to focus on my coursework, but it kills my appetite.Between the stress, the depression from the breakup, and the lack of hunger from the adderall, I just don't feel like grocery shopping or cooking or eating anything. This isn't so much restriction as simply not eating or undereating. Some days it just doesn't occur to me to eat. This has been going on for about 3 months now. I've lost  weight but I'm not clinically sick at this point - I'm hovering around the line between a normal weight and underweight.I've dealt with borderline-ED before. I was unhappy with my slight college weight gain, so I restricted, occasionally binging and purging, and exercised. Although I counted calories obsessively, I generally got enough to eat and I never felt sick. Eventually I graduated and didn't have time to work out anymore - all the bad (and good) habits I had developed went away.Right now I don't know how to fix my problem. I've been on anti-depressants for over 5 years. I don't think my dose needs to be messed with - everyone has good and bad days and I think these issues are fixable with behavior adjustments. My internal chemistry isn't the issue right now.I recently started seeing a new therapist. I didn't know when I started seeing her she is actually an ED specialist so that's good. However, my last few sessions with her have focused on my breakup and stress over upcoming exams (which will make or break my graduate career - no pressure!). I plan to discuss my eating with her more next time I see her, but that's not for 2 weeks. At the same time, I will confess that at times I feel good when I see myself looking very thin. I weight myself often and I freak out if the number goes up even a tiny bit. These sorts of behaviors are scaring me.Even when I try to eat, I don't have any appetite. This morning for breakfast, It was not very much food, but I couldn't finish it. I felt full, to the point of feeling sick and nauseous like I had overeaten.I don't know what to do. I want to feel better, and eat healthy, but when I try I just can't do it. I want to feel emotionally better, but I don't think it is safe to do the things that (in my experience with depression) will make me feel better, like exercising. If I stopped taking my adderall I could probably eat, but I can't afford to mess with my concentration at this point. I feel trapped at every turn.Please, any advise is helpful! What should I do? How can I do well on my exams if I am not eating much?

Earlier this year I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder, which was a relief, because at least I knew what it was.However, I'm struggling with ways to manage this disorder. My weight is alarmingly high, and I just can't seem to stick to diets. I did weight watchers for a while, but fell off the wagon, and I joined slimming world because it actually helps change your eating habits and lets you eat more, but again I fell off the wagon.I've been to therapy over the years, because I also have depression/anxiety, but nothing can make me stop eating. I feel like the comfort eating started when I was 13 and I don't know how to stop.My family are all very concerned, and so am I. I know I just need to find the willpower, but it's all so overwhelming. I'm just looking for some guidance and advice to help me make a change, and also how to explain it to my parents, who are very practical, and don't know how to deal with it. Thanks.
I have recently left a 25 week stay in an inpatient facility for my anorexia. It was a long, hard process involving significant weight restoration and challenging all the 'rules' I had made for myself. I was discharged very shortly after reaching the minimum healthy BMI that the program requires, and am now largely without dietary support. I want to continue to gain a bit of weight to give myself more of a 'buffer' above the minimum BMI but am unsure of how to go about it on my own. I worry that I won't be able to keep challenging myself to my fear foods the way I did when I had support 24/7. Any help or advice would be very much appreciated.
I've been struggling with anorexic tendencies for a few months now, eating extremely few calories in a day. However, I've recently begun to recover with the help of a few close friends. No one else knows what's been going on. At this point, I don't feel physically bad or even all that weak. But I'm worried about the damage I may have caused my body. I was never more than a tiny bit "underweight" on the BMI scale, but could my muscles or bones be in trouble even if I feel fine and am eating a normal amount now? Should I see a doctor?
For my birthday I've been receiving some clothes that are in my old size and it is unbelievably triggering. I've gotten two pairs of pants that won't button up and fit comfortably and I don't know what to do about it. As of now, I've torn off the tags and promised myself to get fit and stick to my vegan diet to try to fit into them in a healthy way. I just can't bring myself to admit to my family that I can't fit into the size that I wore for years, but I'm afraid of a relapse. I feel like such a failure. These are gifts from family members who don't know (as far as I know) about my time in treatment, so I don't feel comfortable outright telling them that a pair of pants is so upsetting to me. On the other hand, I feel terrible about them wasting money on me. I'm just not sure what to do about this.Do I say anything to anyone or not? How do I deal with this in the future?
Hey guys. I'm a 19 year old female who's been struggling with Anorexia for about 2 years now. I've finally reached rock bottom, which is what it's taken for me to genuinely want to change my ways and realize enough is enough. I'm seeing a doctor this week, and starting to see a counsellor. Unfortunately in my area there isn't anyone specializing in eating disorders.I was wondering what you guys think of the Minnie Maud recovery guidelines? How did it work for you? Have you heard of anyone who's recovered this way? Or, if you used another method of recovery, what was it? I'm just looking to go into my appointment prepared with some ideas. I can't live like this anymore. Thanks guys:) .Edit: Please only respond if you have experience with Minnie Maud. If you respond please be sensitive to all readers. So far, there is not one remedy that works for everyone, so if you respond, please remember the guidelines and be sensitive.
I've had a couple incidents lately that have really set me back in my recovery. 1. I was trying on dresses for a special event I have coming up. I found one I actually really liked, which was a big step for me because it was more form-fitting and showed off my arms and legs. When I wore it out, my mom's best friend immediately went, "Oh no, promise me you'll never wear that again! You look anorexic!!!" Fortunately my mom stepped in and changed the subject, but my self-confidence was shattered. 2. My SO has started to become very agitated about my weight. I believe he is trying to help, but when he says, "It's easy - just eat more!" or makes me eat while he watches, it's frustrating and anxiety-provoking. When I tried to explain that it wasn't that easy because I'm scared of food, he thought it was a joke ("It's just FOOD! What's scary about that?").With Thanksgiving and all coming up, I'm worried about how to deal with people making comments about my body. I don't want to be rude and shout out "Hey, I'm in recovery from AN so shut-up!", and confrontation/making requests of other people has never been easy for me.Is there some trick for explaining myself or asking people to respect my privacy? I'm trying to get better but every day is a struggle, and hearing people take liberties with talking about my body or giving me unhelpful advice makes me feel like I'd rather disappear.Has anyone been through anything similar? <3edit: please pm /u/NewOrcCity when you reply here.
I never considered my eating habits particularly unhealthy until recently. I've always been underweight and now from stress I've started losing weight more than I'd expected. It's not because I want to, and I'm scared.These past few days I've had horrible eating habits, eating only one meal per day plus a small amount of snack food. None of them have given me much energy. Then tonight, I realized that I haven't been sleeping regularly at all (went to bed at 5 am yesterday and woke up 2pm).I know it's because of university stress, but I am freaking out. I can't bring myself to eat much because I'm stressed and tired, but I know I'm tired because I'm not eating. I'm not particularly depressed, just feeling at a total loss. (I don't know if this is TMI, but I also have been having horrific diarrhea these past few days)It should also be mentioned that my only food source is from my university's cafeteria, but my plan only allows me to eat there once a day. I'm so poor from paying for room, board and classes that it's really the only meal I do get when I force myself to go there.Do I even have an eating disorder or is it just stress?
I am 14 years old and was recently diagnosed with BN. I am attending an outpatient program but I don't know what to do. I am still consistently purging but I'm not losing enough weight. I want to be thinner and I feel weird. I don't know I just want to be thinner.What's wrong with wanting to be thinner?What are the side effects of purging constantly?I can stop any time, right?Why change?
I do my worst eating of the year from November to December. I think part of it is instinctually wanting to eat more because it's cold. Part of it is because I hate my family and love eating my emotions, and the other part, who knows.Last night for example I know I shouldn't have binged but still did. I felt so sluggish when I woke up, and then I didn't feel like working out. Like, this is not who I've worked to become. I've thought I was beyond binging so many times, but at certain times of the year it seems impossible not to avoid.It feels like I'm two people: the shallow self who says "no, don't order the pizza, it's not healthy, this is why you're not losing weight you dumbass", and the deeper self that says "fuck you, I was deprived for a long time and now I'll do whatever I want, because I don't feel guilty anymore."Not as guilty, at least. How can I make it through this holiday period?
For as long as I can remember, I've been labeled a "picky eater" by my parents and family. My diet's mostly limited to potatoes (in most any state), chicken, pasta, toast, cereal, bananas and random snack foods. There's the odd other bit of food I'll eat, like sausages, apples and carrots, but I can only stomach these in small quantities, and I can force most varieties of vegetables down with a lot of effort.Basically everything else, I'm repulsed by. Anything with a glopy texture especially, like sauces and dips. The moment I start moving the food towards my face, the mental block sets in and I seriously can't get past it. It makes eating in public exceptionally difficult. I never ate lunch in school once because of this, and I'm always worried about going out to restaurants or going over to friends' houses for dinner because whatever they're serving might not be part of my extremely limited diet. I can't even eat sandwiches, because the fillings often have a texture that just repulses me, and makes me want to gag.I'm not even sure if this is a real eating disorder, so I'm sorry if these problems are petty in comparison to the effects of real eating disorders, but it's seriously impacting my life and I can't find any advice regarding it. So, can you offer me any?
Eight months ago I finished an outpatient program for my BN.  It was kind of stressful. My fiance has been more than supportive to me. Since I had already been in serious therapy, fighting urges was a little easier. It took me about two months of constant attention to my body's cues and the food I was consuming to be able to keep myself from throwing up. **However, I feel like I've only fixed one aspect of my ED.** **I'm confused about my body.** I feel hungry half the time and I feel full the other half, but still want to eat a lot. My digestive tract is still all wonky. Sometimes I can't use the bathroom regularly for almost a week at a time, and sometimes I get so full I'm nauseous from eating a small snack. I'm confused about if I can even claim that I've recovered? **It was really hard for me to accept what my healthy weight is**, and sometimes I still need to fight the urge to do something to change it. I still almost always have eating or food or nutrition on my mind. Sometimes I even daydream about back when I was ill and I almost miss those times (Is that normal???). I eat several small meals throughout the day because it helps me fight binges, and I can even enjoy it, but I feel guilty about it. Sometimes I feel like I have to force myself to eat, sometimes I feel like I have to control how much I consume. I still identify myself as having an eating disorder and being depressed (I realized that I was only having a depressive episode for about nine months, I qualify more for dysthymia), even though I'm doing much better than I was this time last year.I'm so frustrated because I'm now in college studying to be an RD so I can help other people in (hopefully) other out patient clinics. But I can't apply it to myself. I can recite why fats are good for you, why protein is important, how not all calories are the same, but I feel like none of that applies to me. I got a chance to attend college near other relatives so I moved in with them, but they are crazy religious and still ask me if I'm 'cured' like, I'm piece of ham. I'm moving out in three weeks when the semester is over because I can't stand it. I talk to my fiance about all of this and it helps, but **I miss talking about it with people who genuinely understand.** Sometimes I feel totally misunderstood and misread. I'm bone-deep lonely. Not just because I'm not near people. I feel hollow.I feel like BN became part of me, is still a part of me. It's almost like I don't want to get better. I get upset when people make fun of ED victims. **I have conflicting thoughts:** I think "okay, do this and I will get better" which is logical, but I also think "Well...if I do this then I'm dirty and gross." I feel like I'm in this weird in-between land where I'm not exactly recovered, but I'm not exactly showing enough symptoms to have an ED anymore. * Am I getting better? How can I tell? I think I am, but why am I still obsessed with food and my body?  * What do I have? How do I let go of these thoughts and feelings?  * I'm afraid but reassured at the same time that I still identify as someone with an ED. Does anyone feel the same way? Can anyone relate?  * On a side note, does anyone else feel ashamed for saying 'depressed'? I was always lead to believe that people who said that were faking it because truly 'depressed' people kept it a secret from people. I promise I do know that I depression is real! I know it's scary and a serious problem, however, I grew up being told that it was made up and now I feel like I'm faking it, but other people aren't. Does that make sense? I have conflicting feelings about admitting I have these feelings, I can't tell if I'm genuinely feeling this way or if I'm being dramatic. * Please share your thoughts (if you're comfortable doing so). It would be nice hearing from people that are going through recovery, want to recover, or who have already recovered. I need help from you.­
I'm doing a dissertation on disordered eating in literature, and I'm very interested in learning about people's experiences in being diagnosed with EDNOS. That is,  * what their experiences were with doctors * how it made them feel about their themselves  * how it might have changed their perspective on their behaviour,  * and how it might have impacted the progression of their illness. I know from my own experience that being diagnosed with EDNOS gave me more questions than answers, and I'm curious to learn if others felt the same.
I used to be sort of between anorexia and bulimia and terrified of most foods. I'm past that, and I was even happy with my new size, but for the last 18 months I've been spending £100+ per week on binge food. I've put on enough weight to make me seriously uncomfortable.My bedroom has currently got SIX bin bags of food waste in it. Our trash doesn't get collected all that often and I live in a house with a bunch of other people. I'm pretty antisocial anyway but I can never let anybody in my room.I'm not interested in food unless I'm bingeing. I wander around the supermarket for 20 minutes trying to find healthy food I want to eat but I can't find anything, so I go home and later come back out to buy binge food.I'm trapped by my obsessive bingeing and by my disgusting living arrangement. What are the very first steps I can take to help myself? Even things like "don't eat between meals" are too advanced for me right now because meals aren't happening, even though I'm constantly making meal plans.
I saw a woman come into panera's today. She looked sickly, abnormally thin, and wore baggy clothing, 40-ish. She looked like how I would expect someone that has an eating disorder would look.She came in and just sat down, didn't order. I thought perhaps I should invite her to sit down with my daughter and I to eat. But maybe she was waiting for someone? I didn't know. After about an hour, she left. Didn't meet anyone, didn't order, didn't eat. Just watched people.Is this common behavior for someone with an eating disorder?Did I miss out on a chance to help? I don't underestimate the kindness of strangers and have been on the receiving end in the past. Could I have done something? Would inviting her to sit with us be appropriate? Am I way off base in thinking she had an eating disorder?I'd like to learn if/when I'm in a similar situation.
So my ED has not been too much of an issue these past 2 years (I was receiving help and not opposed to recovery) but anyway, lately a few things have been wrong with my back and now I'm getting a bone density scan. I didn't have my period for about 8 years and it's still not regular, so the osteopath ordered a test and was surprised I'd never had it done before. I'm really nervous!I find myself both wanting the bone density to show something - to validate my ED - but also not wanting it to show anything. I can't imagine that 2 years is enough to reverse any damage. I will be embarrassed if there is nothing to show on the scan. I was always told I was faking it. Regardless of how bad it got, my parents never acknowledged it...I don't know why I'm posting really, or what I'm looking for. Maybe anyone's experiences and what happens afterward, if there is Osteoporosis or Osteopenia? or did anyone have a similar experience where it showed no bone density issue?
I have ended the cycle after 8-9 years of trying! Binge-purge free for the last few months! Finally told someone about my disorder when I saw a therapist and it turns out I have extreme anxiety. She suggested exercise and mindfulness as coping methods. Since pointing out my anxiety I have realised that I DO feel extra anxious around the times I crave food.I already exercise a lot and Im trying the mindfulness thing, but does anyone have any additional strategies? I never found yoga very helpful...Breaking the cycle: I broke the extreme binge purge cycle by using the healthy, structured, pre-packaged food from Jenny Craig for 5 months: - I had no involvement in the food prep - Knew it was already calorie controlled (so I got to stay away from nutrition labels) - "Binges" were limited to the weekly food allowance; even eating tomorrows food meant I didn't gain weight after it all averaged out over the week. And it sucked having a little less food each day so more motivation to stay on track! - AND, even after a binge, because I knew it was calorie controlled I didn't feel as much guilt and managed to end the purge cycle.After a bumpy first couple of weeks, I got into a pattern, eating small meals regularly and had nothing bad around to tempt me. I still messed up occasionally, but it got easier and easier.Sticking to a limited daily menu is helping me. Minimal foods to obsess over, repetitive food choices mean I am less enthusiastic about eating them and eating has become something I do to live instead of enjoy or comfort myself with. Including a lot of healthy but high fat foods in my diet now means I feel REALLY full or REALLY hungry, never in between (~2 hrs after a main meal was when my binges happened more often). Longer feeling full (not just "not hungry") = less cravings for food.Any additional tips for staying on track would also be very welcome!
I'm currently recovering from bulimia (binge/purge through vomiting). I haven't purged in a few weeks so I'm very new to recovery but very strong in my resolve. I haven't yet told my Doctor that I was purging. It was occurring every few weeks for a few days at a time for two years.Now that I'm recovering, I can't help but fear that I've permanently damaged my body. I don't have any symptoms to go by but I do think I start to imagine symptoms of heart failure and kidney failure. Is there a helpful way to overcome this anxiety? Sometimes I just feel need someone to tell me I'm not going to die as I've stopped the addiction.

Basically, I've been struggling with EDNOS for about 3 years (since diagnosis). I am currently on exchange in Japan, and inexplicably my bingeing/purging behaviour has gone into overdrive, despite me actually feeling very comfortable and happy here - not feeling homesick at all.If I were at home, I think I would start to see a therapist about it again, but as I'm here I don't feel able to. If the university here knew I had mental health issues, it is possible they would send me home and I really don't want that. I have considered speaking to some of my new friends here about it, but although I get along with them all really well, it seems like too much pressure to put on a new friendship. Likewise, I don't feel that I can speak to people back home about it, as they will simply worry about me and they each have their own problems which I don't want to add to.So basically, I'm feeling a little stranded. Does anyone know where I could find support online (in English)?Additionally, has anyone had a similar experience, and if so how did they cope with it?
I've been throwing up since I was about 17 years old; I'm 21 now. Used to be overweight/obese as a child and young teen, got down to a normal BMI in high school through purging and restricting. I lost enough weight in a short enough period of time that a tearful intervention by my friends mostly curbed my behaviours. I stopped for maybe 6 months, then did it very infrequently as a means to deal with anxiety after starting university. I've never really quit the habit, so to speak, but it's been at decidedly non-problematic levels for the better part of the last three years.I'm fairly overweight right now, and have been purging at every available opportunity for the last few weeks. Which is not as often as I would perhaps like, as my roommate is home a lot. While part of me can see, logically, that this might be a problem...I don't know. I can't take myself seriously about a potential ED when I'm so overweight already. I don't want to trivialize other people's struggles with genuine mental illness. And the last time it was this bad, I mostly stopped when I was called out on it. I've never been clinically underweight. I'm also about to finish a psychology degree, which makes me feel stupid about seeking help, since I have a fairly thorough understanding of the inner workings of ED, and have successfully counselled friends with anorexia before.I have never seen a doctor or psychologist about this; nor have I told my parents or anyone in my family. Part of me wants to seek guidance with this before I graduate and don't have free and easy access to a therapist anymore; part of me thinks I'll be laughed out of the office because I don't exactly look like I'm suffering with my eating. I don't want them to think I'm being dramatic. And I kind of think I might be being dramatic. Part of me feels like I won't want to follow their advice anyway. Part of me wants to stop, and part of me really doesn't.I don't know if I have an eating disorder or not. I don't know what to do.
I've been looking around for ways to help a friend of mine who has bulimia. However, most of the help is about spotting and getting them to realize that there is a problem type thing. That is not my problem. She already knows she has a problem and is getting outpatient treatment for it.I've got a friend of mine [Let's call her Karen] who has an bulimia [and some other issues.]. We live roughly five hundred miles apart and so we mostly communicate by Facebook. We talk about mutual interests mostly, but from time to time, she will either post on facebook about having a hard day or our conversation will wander in that direction. When it does, I really want to help her. I want to be encouraging and be in her corner. However, I feel somewhat helpless to actually help.I don't understand what it's like to be in her head. I've never had an eating disorder of any sort. I feel like I don't know how to talk to her. I do try to encourage her and try to be a good friend, but it's completely uncharted territory and I'm honestly afraid of accidentally hurting rather then helping.I often analogize it to being like someone has a broken leg. Getting frustrated with them because they can't run across the field with you is not going to help anything. I feel like as a friend, it's my job to lock arms with you and help hold you up as we cross the field together. However, what I'm afraid of is not locking arms right and so because of that you break your leg again. I don't know if that makes sense, so let me try to put it a different way.I really want to be in her corner, but rather then being Micky, I feel like some random person from off the street. How do I deal with this?What is a good way to relate to her difficulties?
I am currently overweight, and I have been most of my life, but I've made a lot of progress this year, coming from being well into morbidly obese. I do a good job of eating & exercising, and I lose at a healthy rate. I get a little overwhelmed by restricting calories, but I don't think I need help for that.When I have cheat days, I easily eat back that entire week's deficit. I purge it all by vomiting, but I know that doesn't really get rid of it. I figure I can continue eating. I have been feeling for so long that this is fine, because it's only once a month, as opposed to more than ten times a day like I was doing before I got on track. But yesterday I genuinely set out to eat moderately for a cheat day, but I found myself compulsively buying more junk food than I actually even wanted, and purging all of it. I felt like I didn't even have a choice.I have a therapist, and I know she's not the most productive one around, but I'm currently in crisis with depression and anxiety and it's really not a good time to go shopping. I might go on Prozac soon, and I need to at least have someone familiar to see every week while I'm adjusting. I think I'll look for someone new if I get through all of this without a hospitalization. But for now, I'd like to know if anyone has any advice for how to talk to her, and what I could expect in return. I don't think I'll ever fully recover, but I want to take steps to feeling more in control and more capable of making the decision not to B&P. Has anyone successfully come back from a very compulsive habit? What were the first things you did to break the cycle?I am motivated to push myself, but that's offset by my low expectations that I'll ever be normative with food. I really want to just focus on not doing what I'm doing anymore. I want to be able to eat off-program every few weeks without binging. And I hate, hate, hate purging so much. It feels like death. How do I do this, with my therapist's help?
Hey,I've (19/m) been diagnosed with Anorexia for 4.5 years now, and it's been about two years since I sort of recovered-but-didn't-really from when I was at my worst, so to speak. Came out of hospital, vowed to never let it happen again (.. sort of) and maintained a not really super high weight. I mean all I really felt like I did was maintain my weight enough so I would lose all attention from doctors and such, which worked, but it didn't really solve anything, just stick it in the background.So now, two years later I've started at a new college and completely relapsed. I've had bouts where I have relapsed but it's never been this bad/lasted this long so far. I think what kind of sparked it is: being surrounded by all these new people and struggling to make friends in the first two weeks by feeling like a complete outsider confirmed my feeling of a lack of identity. So I went back to something I knew, and that could stand in for it - except this time the mentality is not as clear cut and it just makes everything feel so much awful as I'm objectively aware of what's at risk now compared to the last time.So now I'm here (if any of that even made sense), right on the verge of wrecking everything I worked for in the past two years and I just.. don't care. I should, but I don't, and I'm at a loss (so is my therapist..)It's like I faked my way through the past two years without actually solving anything at all (something that my therapist can't seem to understand when I try to be honest)Erm, to finish (wow this seems long) - does anyone have any.. I don't know, advice? I guess, on where to go from here (where I'm pretty much alone support wise. Well, I have my therapist but he's .. well, he can shove it sometimes).
We are a small group of friends and one girl moved away a couple of years ago to a city 5+ hours away. Independently, three of us have noticed signals pointing to an eating disorder, ranging from downy body hair a period of time ago, an obsession with food, and recently, very restricted eating on the few occasions we have eaten together, but because we only see her occasionally, it is hard to tell if she has an eating disorder. Three of us are going to visit in a few weeks, and would like some advice on how to proceed if we keep noticing signs, or what else we should look for. We will be staying at her place. We don't know her friends in the new city, and have only briefly met her new boyfriend. We are comfortable speaking to her parents or brother & wife, who live in the same city as us and we know them well. They see her more often than we do.Tldr; friend lives in another city and we suspect an eating disorder. What should we do on an upcoming visit to either find out more or what should we do if we get enough confirmation to be very concerned?
I'm not sure of the demographics of our subreddit but I was curious to see if anyone works in the health field? Nursing? Community Health? Nutrition? Mental Health?I am about to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Nutrition degree with a concentration in Dietetics. My route would be to become a Registered Dietician.To sum up a lifetime of information in a short sentence, the decision to be a RD (registered dietician) was made at a different time in my life. I thought I was....better.I feel deflated. I wanted to become a RD when I was more "recovered". I thought I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE FEEL BETTER! OMG FOOD IS AWESOME AND EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL THIS HEALTHY! OMG RAINBOWS AND SUNSHINE AND UNICORNS AND AVOCADOS!Now I have a dark cloud over me. I think I eat pretty well? I still restrict...but I don't know. My mind is all over the place. I'm burnt out from school and everything that has to do with food. I have thought about food for the past decade because of my eating disorder. Now I have academically studied food/nutrition/health/physiology day in and day out for the past 3 years. Straight A's. Study study study.Now I feel like my restricting patterns are covered and intertwined with piles of justifications and reasons I feed myself. The worst part is, I don't feel like helping people anymore in that way. Mostly because no one really cares WHY they should eat healthy. They just want me to tell them the easiest way to lose weight.I'm rambling. Does anyone work in the health field? Do you feel like a hypocrite? 

I feel like I'm slipping further into the eating disorder abyss these days. I posted on this subreddit over the summer, and didn't get much feedback, but I'm hoping for more guidance this time.My boyfriend gave me an ultimatum this summer to see a doctor about my bad body image and eating thoughts. I went to the doctor and got told I had BDD, and "disordered eating" leaning on the side of EDNOS. They told me to take a day off of work each week (I work 7 days a week) but I can't afford that and they prescribed me meds. I took them for a while but really didn't think they were helping.Lately the thoughts are worse than ever before. This all started while I was on a weight loss journey, which kind of became an obsession. I injured myself overdoing it with the exercise (I ran a half marathon, then went back to work, worked out during the week and then ran a 5k in the rain that weekend) and I was just on a work trip - which means largely unhealthy eating - and I've not only stalled in my weight loss, but I've gained.It's the gain and the fear of gain that's impacting me. I'm petrified to wake up and see that my double chin's come back. I'm tired of being overweight.But now...on to why I'm posting. While I had thought about throwing up and starving, I had never acted upon it until now. It happened during my work trip. I was eating with a group at a Mexican restaurant there, and I overdid it. I basically binged. And had a margarita - a strong one. During my tipsy state I made myself throw up, but didn't push it too much. I told my boyfriend and he's terrified. I've thought about doing it again, but haven't acted upon it. I've even considering exercising with my injury against doctors orders, so I don't gain weight. Work's been a million times stressful lately and I've been stress eating and binging as well.What do I do? How do I get back on track? How do I keep myself from wanting to throw up?
I have anxiety, depression, and bulimia. I'm a guy. Four years ago I met my (now ex) gf and she had bulimia. I loved her so much, I still do. She said I helped her get better just by loving her. We broke up after three years  and the last thing I said to her was the nastiest thing I ever said to anyone, and about her bulimia. That comment was not me, and it sent me spiraling down into a sea of anxiety of depression. I want to tell her I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. She is happy now and that's great. I've always been underweight and I would eat and eat to gain weight but it is hard gaining weight for me. One day a few weeks ago I found myself sick to the stomach and needed to get rid of the feeling. So I did. Ever since I've been binging and purging. I'm not sure if it's karma or what. I think about that comment all the time. We had such a good relationship and her last memory of me is an evil one. I have suicidal thoughts and daydream about dying. I love her so much and I wish she would know how much she means to me. It's been like a month and I need to stop this before it get's worse. I don't know what to do, where to start. I'm alone and hide all day. I want to drop out of school. Idk what to do.How do I tell her I'm sorry?How do I get out of bulimia?
I've struggled with B/P and BED for several years, tried lots of therapists, meditation, hypnotherapy, anti depressants, clonazepam for anxiety. etc. and have done better or worse depending on whats going on in my life but have never really been able to complete recover. I started researching drugs for Bulimia and BED and other than anti-depressants there is nothing FDA approved. Since I've tried those and they didn't work, and they can make you gain weight, I didn't want to try those again. I considered Topimax, but I have a girl friend on it and she told me of horrible side effects and having a hard time focusing. Not really an option for me since I need to be on point for work. Anyways, I came across a few studies on Vyvanse, an ADHD drug, that is trying to get FDA approval right now for BED. I talked to my doctor about it, she had never heard of it being used for ED so she researched it and agreed to try it on one condition. She said I had to promise no purging (vomit type not exercise) as vomiting could give me seizures, which is why it was tested on BED and not bulimics. Well seizures are pretty scary... enough to get me on-board with no purging and knowing if I don't binge then I don't purge. She started me on 20 mg/day for the first week and then moved me to 40 mg. Its been 3 weeks and I haven't had one binging episode yet!!!! This is the longest I've gone in...well... forever it seems.So my question to the group. There isn't a lot of information on how to use Vyvanse... I'm curious if anyone else has tried it? If so, how long did you take it for? Did you try stopping it and if so did your binging come back? Do you take it every day? My hope is Vyvanse will be enough to break the "habit" part of my ED while my therapy works on the emotional part.
My roommate is a friend from work and we started living together 2 months ago. I have noticed she throws up her food but does things like leave the toilet seat up, almost to be obvious, I don’t know. I have been ignoring it. Last night I walked into the bathroom and saw her making herself throw up. She did not see me. I don’t know what to do. It is upsetting because I do care for her, but I don’t know how much to get into her business. Do i continue to ignore? Please help.
Long story short, I've been recovered from AN for some time and am at a healthy weight. However, for the longest time, I still used a food scale religiously and kept a food journal/app (flipped between a few methods). As of late due to stress and the fact that I am still at this whole religious tracking, I've had issues binging off an on for the past few months. Last nights basically occurred because I wanted a healthy food item, was hungry for 2, but only had "allowance" for one. I ate one serving...then another...then broke out some other food and went at it. It hit me right after it happened. I now binge off and on when anything is off limits. I also binge when I figure out what I'm eating for the next meal (really bad at night trying to figure out what to eat for breakfast).So...as I'm writing this, I literally just threw out my food scale(...s-yes its sad). I now know that I'm going to be anxious pretty much 24/7 for the next few weeks, but I tried weening off of counting in the past and it never worked. The second I got stressed I'd regress..I'm kind of an all or nothing person, so I'm going to try it this way.Any tips on how to manage anxiety? Intuitive eating? Making sure I'm still doing okay health wise (I just weigh myself 1x a week)?
My friend, who in recent months has become my roommate, struggles with an ED. Before moving in together, we talked very often but of course I could only know what she told me over the phone. Although she never specifically told me that she has an ED, she has often talked about her food issues and stress surrounding them, and although I am not sure how to describe it, but it is very clear between the two of us that I am aware of it. However, despite me knowing about her issues and being highly concerned for her well being all the time, I know it is not my place to comment on her habits or to tell her what to do in anyway. This is mostly due to the fact that I know her mother is not supportive of the notion of her having any kind of issue, and often will stress her out by forcing her into eating, and that she also regularly would see a therapist, although honestly I have my doubts about her mentioning anything food related to her. During this time I knew not to be the person to bring anything related up, as again, she has enough people doing that and I am her friend, not her therapist and I do not want to become another source of stress to her or have her distrust me in anyway. She has made it very clear that she does not wish to talk about it. Coming to now, however, I am concerned enough to want to break my silence. As I’ve said, we now live together and spend a large percentage of our time together. For a while she was doing great, without her mother there to stress her out and without anything else stressful in her life it was ok. Recently though this has changed, and I have picked up that she had not been eating well for a couple of days, and now I am certain that besides an unnatural amount of water she has not eaten anything in more than a couple of days. I am at a loss for what to do, as I know that I cannot make her do anything, but I don’t know if it is smarter or safer to her health for me to tell her my observations or not to. On one hand I don’t want her to continue this of course, because she is very obviously not feeling well and I am scared for anything more serious happening to her because of this, but on the other I do not want to break her trust or cause her to become anymore stressed out due by me talking to her. I’m just at a total loss for what to do or say reddit, I just want her to be ok again ):
I've recently started dating this girl who I am pretty into, and things seem to be getting serious. Her eating habits do concern me though and I'm looking to find out if she does in fact have an ED, and how I should approach her about my concerns.For starters, she does have celiac, which she was diagnosed with about a year ago; she also chooses to be vegetarian. Because of these two things she is obviously very limited in what she can eat. She is not visibly underweight to the point where its noticeable in everyday interaction, but from the chart in the side-bar, and judging by what shes told me her height/weight are, she definitely may be underweight. She admits to not eating much at all and says that she is tired of the foods she is able to eat; when I asked her what she enjoys she says she eats marshmallows and chocolate chips and drinks a lot of lattes/Espresso. I have hung out with her about 5 times, some of which were for 8+ hours and during that time she has only drank coffee/water. I've had to eat multiple times during these times to keep from getting HANGRY, as I put it. She has also told me that she ate a specific number of calories for a period of time that I know to be well below what is healthy; she says she did this because friend told her it was okay/healthy.Do you guys think she has an ED judging from this info? How do I bring it up without hurting/offending her? I take my personal health really seriously, and even though I haven't known her long it is difficult to see someone seem to be so uninterested in/struggle with food. Thanks in advance guys.
I've been bulimic for 8 years and a month into my recovery. After looking through some of the medical effects of bulimia, I've only just started to realise that the pains I've been having are likely to be related to my eating disorder. I get very severe stomach pains I can barely talk through and used to, very naively, blame it on hunger pains or too much food. I've recently started to have chest pains as well which got quite bad last night. I'm not 100% sure this is due to my bulimia but now I'm getting worried. I've read so many stories of the problems people have had because of their disorder and not sure what step I should take now. I'm away from home and not registered which any doctors in my area. I have tried calling the local doctors but they say that they're full. I was considering going to A&E (emergency room) but how urgent do you think this is? I feel like I'm overreacting slightly and not sure what tests they can actually do or whether they'd do anything once I'm there.There is also the choice of calling the NHS helpline but it's expensive and not sure how much they'll be able to help.
I would like to collect anonymous feedback from other eating disorder sufferers for a presentation I am doing on EDs in my college Psychology course. I have set up a survey online which keeps all submissions anonymous (to me, and thus to everyone else), in the hope that I can shed light on the individual struggle. I want to keep my presentation from being clinical and impersonal while still respecting the privacy rights of sufferers.This is a link to the survey https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CTFS3RP and the password is "roadtorecovery" ... I greatly appreciate all your help. Thanks.
First, thank you to anyone for your time and comments on this thread. Secondly, please forgive me if in my attempt to speak knowledgably, I use any wrong wording or misinformation. I’m here for help and not to offend anyone.My girlfriend and I have a fantastic relationship. There’s not a thing about her I would change, except, this one thing. She’s struggled with binge eating and purging for a long time now. This all pre-dates our relationship. Earlier in our relationship, I addressed it. It was obvious that she was sneaking off after meals. Sometimes, I’d find the underside of the toilette seat to have stained or still wet vomit.We had a very open, though hard conversation about her addiction. She’s gone through therapy and has done a 30 day inpatient rehab. She’s explained to me that her addition is not fueled by a body image issue, but rather it’s a control issue. Also, we’ve talked about the sugar rushes she experiences from carbs and junk food and enjoying that feeling. I’m not certain, but I believe she’s bingeing and purging about every 4-5 days.I know that I can’t be her white knight. I can’t fix this for her. I’ve dated a person with an eating disorder before, and it’s a hard battle. And it’s a battle that can’t be fought by anyone other than the person suffering.I’m having a hard time with it, because while she’s open to talking to me when I have questions, it’s an incredibly hard conversation to start. I know she’s ashamed and embarrassed by it, so having starting a conversation about not wanting to be finding vomit stained toilets anymore is difficult.I know I can’t fix this, but I can support her with every fiber of my body. I’m looking for any advice for being in a relationship with a person that’s suffering; if there are any communication tips, things to say and not say. I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or make her feel bad. She’s stopped going to therapy within the last 3 months, and I feel like maybe she needs to keep trying. How do I suggest that?Again, thank you all for your comments/advice. 

I know I have BED, and I have had for the past couple of years now. The past few months have been quite good, in that I have discovered a way that works for me in getting over the disorder, and whilst I still have a way to go in overcoming it completely, I've definitely made progress. My question is about reminding myself about it. For example, when I haven't binged in about a month or so, I feel so great and happy and back to my normal self that I forget I have this unhealthy relationship with food, and allow myself to eat something I wouldn't normally. This is the trigger, and it then happens all over again. When I'm feeling so good, and I try to remind myself that I'm a recovering binger, I don't believe myself. I become schizophrenic and talk myself out of the fact that I need to be careful with food. But once I have that bad food which I know I shouldn't, I go on a 2 day binge and make myself completely sick and hate myself for it. only THEN do I remember, and believe the rational me, that I am a recovering food addict.How do you guys remind yourself after extended periods of time NOT to have that food in case it starts another vicious cycle? When you've come such a long way and it feels like that part of your past never existed, how do you remind yourself that it did, and that it'll never be the same for you as it is with other people who haven't suffered the disorder??
Do I have an eating disorderI'm really confused right now about whether I have an eating disorder. I'm a 21 year-old, 5-10 male and am severely underweight. When I say that I mean I want to make it clear that severely means really, really, severely. I would only be at the correct weight, according to my doctor, if I would a lot shorter and female. When I used one of those BMI scanners in health class, it just read "error", though at the time I thought that meant I was in really good shape.Anyway, I eat 1-1.5 meals a day plus a snack or two. My meals are usually small compared to other people since I'm rarely hungry and get full easily. I had previously never worried about this, I was always underweight for my height, but it hasn't really affected my life as far as I can tell. I always eat when I'm hungry and eat till I'm full. In fact, sometimes I eat until I'm uncomfortably full. What brought on my concern is that I recently spent 5 days at the hospital. I was incredibly sick, and couldn't hold down and food or liquid and had to go to the hospital to avoid dehydrating. At first the doctors thought I had a flu or something, but by the 2nd day 4 out of 5 times I was visited by a doctor it was a psychiatrist, they were weighing my food before and after I ate and on the 4th day they told me they thought I might be anorexic. I told them that I wasn't, that I wanted to gain weight, but had a really hard time doing it. They didn't really listen to me and kept asking me over and over about if I skipped meals, and how I personally felt bout my weight, I told them I didn't skip meals and that I wanted to gain weight. At first they didn't believe me, then they said I might have anorexia without realizing it.I'm out of the hospital now, but they want me to see a psychiatrist and a therapist about whether I have an eating disorder or not. They said my health could be in serious jeopardy. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether or not I actually have an eating disorder, and should see the doctors (an important note is that I'm a broke college student with no health insurance and only want to take this route if I'm really in danger) or if I just have bad eating habits and should maybe work to improve my diet. Important things I want to reiterate are that I never don't eat on purpose, except sometimes if I'm feeling really depressed, but that doesn't happen too often, and that I feel like my health is fine, in fact I play tennis and teach it to kids over the summer.I just want someone to tell me whether I have an eating disorder or just bad eating habits? I've never really thought about this before, but the doctors at the hospital really scared and confused me. They even told my parents that they think I have an eating disorder and now my parents won't stop bugging me about it.  I really need an answer.
Not going to get into a long description of what's going on, but my GF is having a complete breakdown (by her own admission) and says she needs to talk to someone immediately. The phone numbers for NEDA and ANAD are not open on the weekend.She is self-harming. Her mind is on overdrive with thoughts of self-hate, abuse, body-shaming, "not deserving food/love", etc.She has been suffering from ED for years, but it has been extremely bad for about a year and half. She went into an outpatient facility about 8 months but broke away from guidelines while there and quickly turned to old habits after leaving. She was seeing a therapist who dropped her a couple months ago and she has stopped seeing her nutritionist.She says she has no one to talk to about what she is going through, but she is at a breaking point and desperately needs to talk to someone.We have very little money and she does not have insurance. I know she needs long-term help, but is there any outlet for her to reach out to today?
I've been struggling with food addiction for several years. I have good years and bad years, good days and bad days. When we started dating I was in a good place, but now, after a couple years of marriage my monster is starting to emerge from its cave. I had been very good about healthy eating and regular exercise, but lately I can't get my shit together.I tried to tell him a couple weeks ago, "that I'm not just a girl struggling to lose weight, I have a real problem." I'm not sure he really understands the extent of it, or thinks of it as a real disorder. His response was, "ok." Last night after dinner with a friend i stopped at two places on the way home for extra treats. I felt like shit about it, obviously, and this morning when he rolled over and put his arm around me I recoiled and said, "please don't touch my stomach." I DO NOT want to push him away, hide things from him, or withdraw into hiding as is bound to happen.First, what do I say so that he truly understands that food addiction is a real, serious thing? Second, what kind of support is helpful from him? I don't know how to lean on someone for something that I've always kept fiercely private. I have no doubt that he will be supportive, but I don't think either of us know what that really means.I've never sought counseling for this before, but I think it's time to do so. I cannot watch myself repeat cycles of massive weight gain and depression, and I cannot hide from my marriage because of my disorder.
Two weeks ago my boyfriend of almost two years confessed he had been 'living a double life" and was cheating with his ex-girlfriend (which was also his girlfriend - he had two girlfriends - me and her).He told me he was in love with her and was breaking it off with me to be with her and her two children. He let me know all this via email.His other girlfriend (she lives in another state) didn't know that he and I were still together - -- he told her that we had broke up in May --- which wasn't the case. I knew there was an problem due to the decrease of sex in our relationship - which I addressed with him and he stated it was due to him going through depression.As someone who has been through depression off and on all my life - I tried to be understanding and backed off the issue for a while. Offering him advice, support and time.Well, all that time he had been having sex with her - he was going back to his hometown every month -- which is 6 hrs from where we live to be with her - and do all the relationship/couple things I wanted to do with him - with her.The issue is - even though I wasn't IN love - I loved him and cared about him a lot and also thought we had a great and supportive friendship aspect of our relationship. So, I feel betrayed and really hurt.He knew that I have been dealing with eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia) all my life. He also knows/knew that I battled with disordered eating/thoughts daily (hence ED recovery books all over the apartment) and that I am in therapy for it.He also knew he was my first real relationship in three years -- since I got serious about recovery.After he let me know he wanted to be with his ex - his ex reached out to me to tell me she didn't know that we were still together and to basically rag on him and compare notes - since he was with us both at the same time.In our conversation with each other she said that he claimed he broke up with me in May and the reason was I wanted an increase in sex (which I did ask him for - so he shared that with her) --- and that he was not physically attracted to me - so he couldn't have sex with me like that. But, he told her that with her --he could ALL THE TIME.In the last month or so, we had been having sex more regularly and thought his "depression" was improving.When she told me that, I felt terrible and broken. All that time, I thought he liked me and was very attracted to me - as that is what he stated when he pursued me hard for three months in the beginning of our relationship and always acted as he was.I know that I am attractive and I don't have issues with men trying to get to know me - and he knows that. But, it is my own thoughts about myself that keep me from engaging or entertaining men for relationships and/or friendships.I am currently at a healthy weight. I feel I could stand to lose  some lbs but I overall I think I am ok. His other girl is taller and weighs more than me - but I guess it's packaged better to him. I don't know....Since this has happen my ED is back in full effect. I have told my therapist and been reading all I can on self compassion and esteem - but I still feel terrible.What makes it worst is my family and friends think I am already too small at this weight -- and they are worried that my ED is back - and now I have BD symptoms cause I see something totally different than what everyone else is seeing.What do I do? I am trying to let his comments go and not care and continue my recovery but I feel like I am right back where I started.
I don't even know where to start with this, there's too much to say for one reddit post. I've realised in the past year that I have a problem with binge eating, and have done for a huge part of my life. But only recently it's become a huge problem. I have reached breaking point. Every day I'm fighting the same fucking battle. I hate my body, so I go on a health kick that lasts about two days. I go running, I count calories, the whole shebang. Then I decide it won't make a difference, then go on a huge binge, then feel awful about myself and lock myself away and cry. Rinse and repeat.And I'm sick of it. I hate feeling this way, I hate my body, I hate this awful unhealthy relationship that I have with food. I really don't know what to do or where to turn, I don't even know if there's any point in attempting to fix this, because every time I try, I just relapse and binge. It's an endless cycle. How can I learn to appreciate my body? Ways of dealing with stress and other unpleasant emotions?Where do I start?Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
After a particularly bad week of relapse, I have broken down to my boyfriend a lot. Sometimes I forget how hard it is for that person helping too. He struggles to understand why I do it and I can see the frustration when he sees me binge straight after purging. In an attempt to get a better understanding of it all, he tried looking for information online but got too upset and couldn't bring himself to watch the videos on it. I've been so blind to how much this is hurting him and feel awful that I'm putting this pressure on him.How far can I really go? I've started lying to him now and told him I went a whole day without purging just to give him some relief from it all.I wouldn't be trying to change this part of my life without him because I know that it would be unsuccessful. He allows me to rant about my problems and doesn't judge me when he finds me sneaking food or sneaking off to the toilet. But now I'm worried it's going to get too much for him.Anybody out there with family or friends with bulimia, how did you cope? When is it time for me to stop leaning on him when I feel myself slipping?
Hi there! I have a roommate that I'm pretty positive is bulimic. I just wanted to ask whats the right way to ask or if I should catch him red handed (I easily could). We're pretty close but this is a sensitive subject and I would like some advice.
I am a 21yo female in college and have always been on the lower range of a healthy body weight. Last November I realized I had gained some weight after not exercising regularly--as I had been all throughout high school--so I started to count my calories and exercise 5days/wk. My family was thrilled that I had begun to exercise more. They have always been supportive and encouraged sports, healthy eating, and a healthy body. I ended up losing fat and gaining some muscle, which I was really happy about and I felt great! But then I broke up with my long-term SO, changed my college major, and decided to study abroad. I guess that's where the tipping point was. I then started getting almost addicted to the feeling of seeing the numbers on the scale go down and seeing that my clothes were getting looser. I would count calories obsessively and follow a low-carb, vegetarian diet. 7 months after I decided to begin losing weight, I am now very underweight. I can't stop thinking about food and calories and carb content. I am chronically constipated and constantly feel cold despite living abroad in 80-90F weather every day. I avoid going out to dinner with my friends here, and don't go out drinking with them because of the added empty calories. I have begun to get worried about my health and don't know what to do. Like I said, I am currently studying abroad so I don't have family or close friends here to talk to. I also do not have access to a health care provider except for the university health service here... which I am hesitant to go to, as they may not understand me. My question is: What should I do for help? I don't want to worry my parents/family back home by telling them I may have a problem since I'm so far away. Is there a group or provider/counselor I can email or talk to via internet (I only have a Chinese phone)? I don't think I'm so out of control that I necessarily need a counselor, so is there a way I can help myself by myself? Thank you very much. I really appreciate your help!
My girlfriend drunkenly admitted to me last friday that she is clinically depressed and not and meds, and bulimic. She told me that her body is used to throwing up at least once a day. I've dealt with depression before for myself, and I know how to help in a way, but I have no idea how to help her with her eating disorder, and I imagine they are very linked. She told me that being bulimic has "kept her grounded" for a long time. I told her that I could not abide it - meaning that I can't allow myself to ignore it, which she asked me to. She said "I get selfish when I get drunk", which I guess means she thinks putting her issues on me is selfish? I told that it isn't at all. The other thing I told her was that anytime she felt the need to make herself throw up, to call me or text me, and I would get there immediately, or talk to her immediately. I've also been asking her at least once every day "how she is doing" meaning if she has made it through the day without forcing herself to throw up. We made it through the weekend without an incident, but today she was feeling nauseous and made herself throw up to get rid of the feeling. She had also been experiencing trouble keeping at least one of her meals down each day, but was able to do it, probably because we were together most of the weekend and she forced herself to keep it down. But she told me today "I messed up" and told me what happened.She is very scared to stop her habits because she believes they help her stay grounded.Please help me! Is her case severe? Does she need to be checked into a treatment centre or at least get a treatment program? I am the only she has told, and she didn't even mean to tell me. So if a treatment was to happen she would have to tell at least her mother, which I think she should anyways.I can use any advice you have! please, thank you
I've recently come to terms with the fact I'm a binge eater, and it's been a legitimate issue I've struggled with for as long as I can remember, although I've only just recently acknowledged it's existence in my life. I can't exactly identify why (at least there was no major motivating factor)...it's just simply something I've done.I first looked into the world of binge eating a couple of months ago...I had never really given serious thought to that subject before. Over the next month or so, I kept an eye on my hunger habits and routines. I realized that I never really reach a point of satisfaction. There's always some sort of hunger burning in my stomach.I'm a 21 year old guy who used to be a pretty unhealthy individual, but around March I decided to change my diet and exercising habits and ended up losing some weight and getting in better physical shape. Today, I still maintain good exercise habits, and in terms of quality my choices in food are pretty healthy as well. Still, I feel like all of the effort I'm putting into steering myself back on track with exercising and dieting is being nulled by the fact I can never seem to satisfy my hunger and over indulge myself with huge quantities of food.I struggled in life with severe depression and anxiety, and I sought out help about a year ago. I'm in a far better place than I was around that time, although like everyone else recovering I still have my moments. I don't personally think any of those issues contribute to the binge eating, though I could be wrong.As someone completely new to this world and as someone finally acknowledging as issue like this in my life, I ask my friends in this community to help a guy just know where to even start. What are some resources I should be looking into? Who should I talk to about it (I can't really afford therapy atm..)? Strategies? Any help would be genuinely appreciated.Thanks for taking a few seconds out of your day for a guy who feels a little in over his head. Smile today.
Background: long story short: I spent the last summer eating too little calories and over-exercising. I lost some weight because of it, and am now at an unhealthy BMI.Issue: Now that I'm trying to recover my lost weight, I don't know when I am supposed to stop eating. I am currently lifting light weights to make sure the mass I gain balanced, but I still don't feel confident with over-eating.For instance, just today I know that I went over the calories I needed by a reasonable amount. However, I ate some bad food that was high in calories and low in nutrients, so I am still hungry. I really want to eat some more food so I can feel full, but I know I will just be eating an unhealthy high amount.Should there be a cap for how many calories I eat, or is it more important that I feel full?
Met a really cool girl recently. We have a lot in common and had some very intense conversations over a short space of time. Long story short - after a friend of hers passed away from anorexia, she told me she is in recovery from anorexia and currently bulimic. I was pretty rocked to be honest. Especially as I am still getting to know this girl.We're going to see each other a lot over the next year or two so it's important we maintain a friendly relationship. I really don't know what to do. I find myself avoiding her not because of what she told me, but more so that I don't want to get hurt. I'm still raw from previous relationships and have pretty low self-esteem.How does one maintain a platonic relationship given the situation?
Hi everyone,I'm looking for some advice in my recovery from AN b/p subtype. For some background, my ED is basically binging and purging all of the time, I rarely restrict (despite my diagnosis of AN), and that is what I am trying to recover from. I was in IP in August and discharged with an OP team and a meal plan. I stopped seeing my OP dietician, however, at the end of September because my insurance was not covering it, and she wasn't helping at all (I was following my meal plan to a T and didn't restore weight and all she told me was to eat desserts with every meal).My main problem is this: I can't stop binging and purging, and no one seems to even recognize it as an issue despite my insistence that I need help with it. Especially with all of the doctors I saw in IP, it seems they took one look at me, saw that I'm underweight, and assumed that I am restricting. No matter how many times I said that I hardly restrict, I just binged and purged all day, they won't address it. When I go to my dad's house, he'd stock up on junk food and pressure me to eat it all, essentially pressuring me into a relapse. It took me MONTHS to convince him that binging is, in fact, what I'm trying to recover from. And when I go see my OP team and tell them of an episode, they just say "I'm glad you gave yourself permission to eat that! You're doing so well!" as if it were some sort of triumph and not a terrible demon that I feel is controlling my life.I would understand this attitude if I were recovering from restricting type AN, since binging is a fairly normal part of recovery. But I hardly restrict which is part of what terrifies me. But I feel like I'm going insane from this. The urge to binge is constant and I have to fight it every moment of every day. I made it three weeks free, and while I thought it would get easier to resist, it just felt like it got more difficult everyday until I simply couldn't handle it anymore and I turned into a raging monster tearing through half of the refrigerator. It doesn't help that no one seems to understand what the real problem is, and they're practically congratulating me every time I relapse.I would also understand if this had only started recently. So, I don't really want to do the MinnieMaud approach of letting myself eat whatever I want because I know that binging is mainly just a destructive coping mechanism for me and I don't want to reinforce it. Especially because I don't think that I would be able to stop binging, even when I got back up to a normal weight.What helped you through recovery? How did you get others to understand that binging and purging is the problem? Thanks!

Alright, so I am a 20 year old male who struggled with anorexia for around a year, following some drastic changes in my life. It caused severe effects to my body, but I am now at a much healthier weight although I do not quite have the athletic muscles that I used to. I am an active guy though. I enjoy running and have been trying to lift some weights recently to gain back some muscle. But currently, I struggle with Bulimia (non-vomiting) and it is something that drives me absolutely nuts because it dictates my life, prevents me from being/feeling normal, and just fuels my overall depression. I truly want to make some changes with my eating disorder, but as I'm sure you all know, my mind prevents me from taking the actions that I have began to realize that I need to take. I just really want some help because I am at University now and I have not been enjoying myself, have had no self-esteem, and have yet to make friends. I really believe this eating disorder is preventing me from being myself. By the way, this subreddit has been EXTREMELY useful for helping me understand my condition a little bit better. But, I am submitting this because all of our circumstances are unique and the best advice is tailored to our own personal needs. This eating disorder has seriously been the most difficult thing I have ever been though, and it has cost me some really valuable things in life. It has gone on too long and I am becoming desperate for help since I don't have anyone to talk to about it. If you guys need to know anything else, I'd be more than happy to go into more detail.One of the weird habits that continues to humiliate me is my relationship with restricting carbs. I really want to eliminate that mind block because I feel like gradually introducing carbs back into my diet will allow me to eat a bit more freely, like I used to. The whole "low-carb" trend has really messed with the way my mind views carbs. But, I feel like it will remove a large portion of the the anxiety I have towards food if I can eat them again. So, this is the first tiny step I want to actively take towards being "recovered". It seems so simple, but my mind has convinced me otherwise. So, how can I introduce some carbs back into my diet without bingeing on them? For some time now, I haven't been eating any carbs at all and I am aware that it is a problem in my life. I try not to even look at the Nutrition Facts on food any more, as it fuels my anxiety. Anyways, I just want to thank you guys in advanced, whether I get any responses or not. Feel free to ask any more questions.
Hi there, I'm hoping somebody will be able to help, because there's not a lot of info online about what I think is turning into bulimia. Here's the backstory:Earlier this year, I was laid off from my full-time job and the financial consequences swept me off my feet. I was raised upper-middle-class in Australia (now living in the US), am financially responsible, and went to an expensive private school, so I never thought that I would find myself living on the streets, but that's exactly what happened to me. I lived out of my car for three months, and often ate food from dumpsters (or occasionally stole it from tables in fast food restaurants) because I felt bad accessing resources for the homeless as I felt that I had had a good life so far and didn't deserve the help. (My parents didn't want to help me and I didn't want to burden my friends by asking for help.)Now, I'm back on my feet with a place to live and a full-time job that pays more than most people my age earn (I'm 23), and life is getting back to normal. However, now I feel out of control with binging - not so much out of a low self-esteem, but out of a suffocating awareness of how easily I could topple into poverty. Whenever I see food, I eat it all. I can't keep food in the house because I eat until the pantry is empty and I feel sick. I then feel really bad about myself because like any 23-year-old female, I want to be attractive and healthy. (Plus, I used to work in high fashion, and I never used to eat then like I do now.)But I know the big problem here is that I can't shake the feeling of food insecurity. I can't stop feeling like I may not be able to buy food for the next week and I might have to dig in rubbish bins in parks at night again. I KNOW I have a job now and everything's ok. But I don't know how to get out of feeling this way and binging like there's no tomorrow as if I don't know when my next meal will come...please help! I feel awful. How can I shake the feeling of food insecurity?Thank you.
I had been slipping into my bulimic tendencies the last few months. I really thought I had control. Everything would be intentional and I could squash that inner voice telling me to purge at work.It didn't work tonight.I came back from dinner feeling full. The uncomfortable feeling overcame me.Before I knew it I was purging my dinner. I know the nurse heard it. Played it off that it was something I ate. I wasn't in control though. So I left early.I feel like such a piece of crap. I had this controlled and now I'm not just spiraling at home. It's happened at work.What do I do???? How do I not let bulimia into my life?
I have been in recovery for about two years and in that time I have become overweight. I am now in the situation where I need to loose a modest amount to return to a healthy weight (Dr.'s advice not mine) and am now dieting and working out to achieve this. I've downloaded an app to make sure that I'm eating enough and track my nutrition. I've found that I've been slipping into old habits a lot easier than I like and it scares me. I'm consistently under eating and working out and last week I purged for the first time in over a year. Are there other people with this problem and what are coping mechanisms they use to deal with it?
I have just binged after been doing pretty well in recovery for awhile. I've been so bored and I think that's what triggered it, or maybe I just don't want to dig deeper. I just really hate that I feel like I am not going to get out of this cycle and I'm just going to keep gaining weight and gaining weight. I hadn't binged in over a month around. I mean i guess I've had mini ones but not a real full out binge in a long time. I knew that If i just kept watching tv I would have been fine, or If I wouldn't have gotten that one snack. I'm just so pissed. Like why. Why can't I just be normal. Can I please have some advice and how you guys deal with binging in recovery? I'm crying as I write this, just feeling hopeless. I can't keep gaining weight, nobody is going to want to be associated with me, I wouldn't want to associate with myself. I just really need someone right now. Much love, XOXO
When my ED was in its prime, I would spend the whole day frightened by an arbitrary number such as a calorie. Now that I'm in recovery, I've learned to simply enjoy food and live each day based on what my body wants. However, there's a problem. I've been living this way for about a month now and have seen no results in terms of weight gain. Could this mean that I need to eat more than what my body wants? Or that I have lost touch with what my body wants?Do I need to count calories to make sure I get at least xx amount of calories each day, or would this lead to another eating disorder entirely? 
I've been with my boyfriend for nearly two years and throughout those years he's known I've had EDNOS - he's never really coped that well when the issue arises so I've tried not to raise the issue too much. But recently things have been tough.This morning, I received a message from him with the dreaded words..."I think this is too much for me and I can't deal with it anymore. I'm so sorry. I'll be asking to see your doctor on an individual basis to discuss everything I know. I'm taking it into my own hands whether you want it or not and I'm afraid I'll have to leave it there."I'm really desperate, even crying whilst I type this, because I have nowhere else to turn. I'm so sorry to have to post something as insignificant as this but nobody I'm currently in contact with knows about my ED aside from my ex.My first question is - how on earth can I cope knowing he's left me because of my eating disorder, when that in itself is the most triggering thing ever for my eating disorder to continue?And two; how on earth can I stop him from going to my doctor and getting everyone involved, when I know from previous personal experience that that broken trust and any kind of forced recovery never works?! (EDIT: He has already gone through with what he said and has told the receptionist at my doctors who will forward his concern to my GP. I'm from the UK and I'm 20 years old so I am aware of the notion of confidentiality, but I'm beside myself as I don't know how this would apply in this situation - it's all so complicated because he brought my severe depression into it too).Thanks in advance if you read.
I was wondering if anyone has real successful recovery stories to share. Or if there's such a thing as a full recovery or if it's something like AA, you have to struggle everyday forever.I'm asking this because I've struggled with EDNOS for what I thought had been 6 years. In 2007/08 I had gotten out of a relationship, was going through some difficult things in my life and started blaming it all on myself and I despised the way I looked. I started regularly dieting, eating low carbs, lean proteins, etc. I lost weight. I came back to my country after a month traveling and losing weight and plateaued. So I restricted a little more my calorie intake. Next thing I know, I'm obsessed with calories. I memorize whole lists of calories and then start betting against myself to see what was the littlest I could eat everyday. If I ever went over a certain amount I'd purge. (I never binged tho). As it usually goes with this disease, I started withdrawing from my family and friends company because social gatherings would usually involve food. I lied all the time and when I couldn't avoid eating, I'd purge afterwards. That went on without stop for a little more than 3 years. Then in 2012 I had to undergo a procedure, but I needed to gain weight. I forced myself into recovery and gained the necessary weight, and actually kept myself "healthy" for sometime. After that I just started gaining weight uncontrollably and long story short (not really), I'm going through everything again. I can't eat, I cry out of anxiety when I have to go out, etc.But that's not the reason why I ask. Last night I was at my parents' and I found some old journals. Some of the stuff was from 2003/04, 4 years before what I thought was my "full blown" condition. And there are pages and pages of odes to how I hated myself and calling me names for being what I considered to be overweight and one of the entries shocked me as I narrated how I had felt guilty after eating out with some friends from uni and then forced myself to purge for the first time ever. And how good it felt to be able to do that and in control. I was shocked because I honestly didn't remember those things or those feelings. I know I've always hated myself and the way I look, but I didn't remember I had had an episode before 08. As I read it became clearer to me I had gone through similar stuff before (restricting, lying, purging, taking meds, etc) and recovered when I quit uni. I don't remember what motivated me to do so, but then in 08 it happened again, and now it's happening again after a brief "normal" period... Is this gonna be my life forever? Is there something wrong with me (other than the obvious)?
My sister (older teenager) 3 years ago started to show signs of being anorexic. We were oblivious about it for too long-you never think these things happen to you. For a while we didn't get any professional help but merely tried to encourage her to eat more. This didn't work so well. Things slowly became worse. She became very moody, reclusive and her eating habits became stranger and stranger. Recently she went to a clinic for eating disorders after she became dangerously thin. ( heart rate was 30-40 bpm and she looked very sick) and that seemed to do nothing besides managing to get her back up to a semi decent weight. However since then her weight has clearly dropped once again. She absolutely refuses to believe she has a problem and gets very aggressive when we try to approach her about it. It's caused a LOT of stress in our family and right now we're just running out of options. I can't see her goingHave any of you ever been in a situation like this? What can I do as her brother? (I'm several years older.) I've really noticed it straining my parent's marriage. I'm especially worried that it may affect her younger sisters (ages 8-13).Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks you guys. 
I recently submitted a post about whether or not the 'something isn't right' feeling is a good indicator that my behaviour might be disordered. Since that time my eating disorder has progressed but I also decided that I wanted to strike now and possibly prevent many years of heartache and struggle. I had my initial appointment with a psychologist yesterday and while I feel that it went well and I really liked her and valued the space to talk about what's been going on, I found the whole thing very emotionally draining and therefore quite triggering. There was a lot of numbers talk (which she assured me was just the first appointment) and I found that particularly difficult, because I have gained a bit in the last few days which obviously is tough. The first thing I did when I left was binge. You can guess the second. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experience with therapy being triggering and how you have coped with it? Is it appropriate to ask my therapist to work with me on some strategies to avoid b/p or major restriction after a session? I want to stick with it but not if it's going to be like this every time.
I'm one of those people who have jumped on the health and fitness bandwagon, but along the way, I did realize that some restrictive behaviours developed. But since then, I have made the conscious decision to recover.So I'm just wondering how you would differentiate an orthorexic from someone who just wants to be healthy? Like, if someone doesn't want to eat a cupcake because they know it's not the "healthiest" option, are they orthorexic, or just health conscious? I guess what I really want to know is if I'm hindering my own recovery/wellbeing by wanting to eat clean, stick to healthier foods, and live healthily, etc.Thank you so much!
I'm in high school, and meet (and exceed) the criteria for bulimia nervosa. My parents found my texts when I confessed my story to a friend, so they know most of it. Thing is, they don't do anything about it. I guarantee they hear my purging, and they're around when I binge. I don't know if I should push the issue and ask for a therapist or not. I kind of want to, because I can't talk to anyone else about it. I'm too scared to text because of what happened, but I'm also too nervous to discuss it in person. I would rather avoid the topic entirely, actually. I cry and break down if I do talk face-to-face about it.I guess my situation is that I don't know how to go about recovery. I feel like I can't begin to recover unless I get officially diagnosed, otherwise I feel like an attention-seeking teenager who exaggerates her problems. Putting a diagnosis to it would be like saying, "Yes, your problems are real. Now go fix them." Does that make sense?I'm so conflicted about the whole thing. I feel like bulimia has taken over me, like a sheet. And underneath that sheet is EDNOS or something, as another sheet. Then underneath that is me. Because if I'm not overeating, I'm not eating at all. Like if I manage to peel off the top layer, another ED is waiting beneath it. I'll cross that bridge when I get there, I guess.How can I get help?How do I talk about this with my parents?Does therapy just mean a diagnosis and then "Now go fix it"? Would therapy help me learn to change?
Not sure if this belongs here or r/pregnant, but I have been battling bulimia for 5 years (shortly after I had my first child). My BMI is on the cusp of being underweight. I've been better though. Eating more and purging less and I have not had an incident for two weeks (I have done this multiple times a day at times). My periods are always regular, but now I'm two months late with a negative three negative pregnancy tests. I've been feeling healthier and don't have any other underlying issues as I just saw my primary doctor a week ago.How likely is it that i messed up my chances of having more children? Has anyone had success or know anyone that has?Thank you.
I don't even know where to start. I started losing weight and while I've always hated my body, I didn't think I would spiral into an eating disorder. I didn't start off counting calories, but I get so upset now if I don't know the calories in something. I haven't started purging yet, but I sometimes feel like it.This is horrible and I don't want to keep feeling like this. Sometimes I feel completely in control and the next moment I'm obsessing over what I just ate or thought about eating. I kept denying that there was anything wrong, but normal people don't cry about eating in a restaurant or about how much oil someone has used in their cooking.I feel like I might end up triggering my mum as well. She was severely anorexic when she was younger and nearly died from it and while she's been recovered for years, she admitted that she still cries sometimes when she looks in the mirror. I feel like my entire family is insane because basically every girl on my mum's side has had an eating disorder. My sister has tried starving herself and has cried about being weighed and my oldest female cousin nearly died from anorexia. My other female cousin has recently gained some weight after showing signs of an eating disorder and now I'm dealing with this.My parents are trying to help, but my father telling me that 'I'm going to be exactly where I belong soon' and telling me that he is going to lock me in a hospital EVERY time an issue with with my eating comes up, is making me want to scream and cry and either break down or destroy something. I feel so unstable right now and I don't know why my mood keeps going like this.I'm going into treatment, but it's still a month away and I don't know how the hell I'm going to cope until then because I know that I'm getting worse every week. Does anyone have any advice or anything to alleviate my mood swings slightly? How do I deal with my parents?
I consider myself to be on a recovery from a restrictive eating disorder, but I still haven't gained weight. I believe this is because although I believe I am eating more, my ED is still influencing my decisions.I've learned that if I am going to gain weight, I won't be able to do it with my safe foods. However, the idea of eating unsafe foods without recording how much I am eating still scares me. I'm doing moderate weightlifting, but what if all my excess calories just makes me fat?I'd like to reach a normal BMI and don't know if it will lead to binge eating. As a kid, I ate junk food all the time. However, I don't know if I can return to that lifestyle without killing my health and becoming obese.How do you accept the fact that you will gain weight, body-fat, during recovery?
I've been bulimic for 13 years. I eat everything in the house and purge regularly. I have a feeling my housemate knows. I want to tell my her but am afraid. Any advice?Thanks!
I suffered with anorexia in and out of the hospital for two years, and of course it affected my whole family. It has now been about a year since i've been out of the hospital, and i'm doing better. The problem is that my younger sister, who basically had to grow up watching me destroy myself, is now restricting what she eats, because she wants to be 'tall and thin like her older sister as she's heard my family say so many times that i am tall and thin. I am very concerned about her health and that this may progress dangerously. I want to do whatever i can to get her as far away from this mindset as possible, but i don't know how. I've got her coming to visit me as a 'play date' at my apartment, so i can show her that i eat, to show her that i do not restrict. She's so young and i don't know how to deal with these issues in a 7 year old. I would really appreciate any advice on how to approach this. I could never forgive myself if this progresses in her the way it did in me.
Hi, long story short, I think my teammate has an ED. I went to her room today with another teammate (who is oblivious) and some little notes caught my eye. They said horrible, horrible things. I myself have fully recovered from EDNOS/bulimia (as much as one can) and I am happy, healthy, and even lucky enough to not be susceptible to triggers.But I've been to that dark place and seeing those quotes really flashed me back for the first time in over 3 years. They are the things you would see on the pro-ED blogs that I frequented long ago. Her roomie also made a comment about how she brings her toothbrush everywhere, and while that could be just her thing, its just SO many red flags. If she doesn't have an ED, she's definitely having disordered thoughts.Me and this girl are fairly close, we both have anxiety and depression and have bonded a little over it and we've reached out to one another after panic attacks. I think that if anybody could reach out with respect and care, I think I could.Because I recovered without anybody confronting me, I need a little help on what might be the best way to do this. I'd like to invite her one on one to my apartment and offer her a shoulder/venting space, a cat to cuddle (she loves cats a lot), or just my love and support and encourage her to see our free psychologist. I also would like to share my story with her so she knows that I at least can empathize with her.I know not to accuse or be forceful and I understand firsthand the attachment one can get to their disorders and how defensive/angry/scared they can be. I know I shouldn't threaten her by outing her. I'm also not a Christian but she has a strong relationship with God and I wonder if she might like relevant scripture or something like that.If she's receptive, where do I go from there? What if she denies? Or if she's angry? How can I get the most positive reaction? I want to offer myself and my experiences as a resource for her and let her know that help is available and encourage her. I'm very worried for her, so any advice would be great. Thanks!
I'm trying to create a short film about bulimia, showing on a personal level of what people with bulimia go through. However I have not personally gone through it myself and I'm unsure how accurate my script is.I'm wondering if anyone is interested in helping me and clarifying some of my errors I may have written. If interested comment/reply and I'll PM you my script, or just pm me and ask: /u/pamalaandersonstoe.
My ED first started as anorexia about 15 years ago and quickly evolved into bulimia. For ~8 years I've been living normal life, with some ED thoughts but nothing serious. My relationship with my SO hit a really rough patch lately, and I'm now on a three-day long binge-purge marathon, and I don't know what to do. I don't have any contact to health care/therapy at the moment. I'm on antidepressants.My SO and I are planning to meet a couples therapist soon, and I'm not sure whether I should talk about this there. Is there any way to stop this now, before things get even worse?
I am currently a year in to my recovery for binge-purge bulimia. I have managed to stop purging (with some relapses over the year) but binge eating and body image are still areas I struggle with.I am currently having difficulty with the lunchtime situation at work. I have no option but to eat with colleagues. We bring in our own food, but I work in a school and so there is often a surplus of the children's cooked dinners (this often includes trays and trays of desserts). I am currently trying to include desserts into my diet in a healthy and moderate way but I still struggle a lot with guilt and sometimes portion sizes - I have a tendency to binge.My issue is that my colleagues are quite competitive dieters and often very restrictive in what they eat. I have come far enough to know that this type of dieting is extremely triggering and unhealthy for me. I am trying to step away from the thin ideal and restricting but this is something my colleagues believe in and engage in.It is really starting to get to me as I am trying to feel comfortable eating a dessert after lunch and eating carbohydrates etc. My colleagues often make comments such as "oh I see you struggle with willpower too" or "its not good to eat x, y, or z in x, y, or z quantities" or "I've cut out x, y and z nutrients because they make you fat" or moan about feeling fat/guilty if they do indulge in certain foods.I am finding this a minefield. I'm really at the beginning stages of trying to feel comfortable with my size and eating desserts etc. The comments my colleagues make about themselves and what they are eating stresses me out. I am not willing to discuss my eating disorder history with them. I am certain they would be extremely understanding if I did, but it doesn't feel professional somehow and it's not something I am comfortable doing.Any tips on staying strong and comfortable with my decisions?Also suggestions for ways to avoiding this from becoming triggering would be extremely helpful.
I struggled with an eating disorder for over 9 years. Because of this close personal connection, I decided to do my Interior Design senior thesis on a outpatient eating disorder facility. I was always afraid of getting help because I believed I 'wasn't sick enough' or I was just afraid of getting better.My goal is to design a community rather than a 'clinic'. I want my design to encourage social support, remove stigma, and encourage recovery.As part of my research, I would love to get input from other people suffering with ED. * What made you decide that you needed to seek treatment? * How did you make your decision on whether to do outpatient or inpatient? How did you choose the facility? * What were issues- if any- that you felt your therapy space had? * Is there anything that you would hope to see in a eating disorder center? * What do you believe to be the most important spaces in a facility towards recovery? What qualities did these spaces have?Thank you! If anyone would be willing to talk further about a facility please PM me, /u/heathaleatha.
I have been in recovery since June 2014, and recently I could just care less. I just want to restrict and purge all the time but its as if I have come so far my mind physically won't let me go there, because my "healthy voice" comes into play, then my ED voice gets so angry, and I beat myself up like no other, to the core. I just wish I had the strength and will power before, because I would rather feel the way I do now and be skinny than feel this way and be fat.Is recovery really this hard? Why bother?What did you tell yourself to stay with recovery?I guess I am just asking if anybody has experienced this during recovery and what your advice or input is for staying with recovery? Thanks, Much Love XOXO

I'm 20 years of age and have been underweight my whole life. I've always wanted to gain weight but I have a serious eating problem. Sometimes I would eat so much but most of the time I can only eat small proportions. Some days I don't feel like eating at all and undereat. I am also very picky about food I'd rather starve than eat something I don't like. I've always knew I had a problem but I never asked for help because my health was always good and I rarely got sick. However, lately I became very sick: - I had fever for days - I threw up everything I ate - My heart was beating very fast for days - I suffered from diarrheaThis resulted in me losing even more weight and I look very unhealthy. I don't know what to do I've had this problem my whole life and I just want to be normal and eat healthy like everyone else but nothing seems to be working. I am also confused as after doing some research I couldn't find an ED that I can relate to. Anorexia seems very likely what I suffer from but I don't think I'm fat, I'm very aware that I am underweight and I'm not trying to lose weight it's just that I can't control my eating habits. Please help, I'm very concerned about my health. Thank you.Do I have an eating disorder?  Could my being sick be due to my low weight?Is denial a part of eating disorders and this is why I'm confused? If it seems I have an eating disorder, how can I begin recovery?

Hi, my sister has bulimia. I'm her younger brother. We have a very strong relationship, and we don't have serious fights often. We love each other but I'm not very good at confrontation. I've been having the suspicion that she has bulimia. I know that she has been fighting it for a while now. Maybe years. I'm an awful brother. I've never had any solid proof of it and have been avoiding the idea of confrontation for a while now. She hates any form of counseling period. Says they aren't helpful (has had bad experiences with school counselors in the past). Lately she's been boasting about losing weight and my parents (who have tried to help in the past to non avail) have been commenting about how she looks like she has lost some weight lately. I believe that only to an extent that she's been able to do this completely by diet. She takes "showers" for a really long time. I thought that for a while that's just what girls do. But now I think it's time we had a talk. I don't know how to bring it up. She's always been the dominant of the two of us seeing as how she's older then me and is extremely defensive. She can argue for hours at a time and still be successful. I've read other posts but I need some more input on this because of how bad I am about talking about this kind of stuff. I want to bring this up with her. How can I without starting an argument that she feels she has to win? What can I say to her?Honestly, any help is really appreciated.
I am in desperate need of help and don't know what to do. My fiancee who I have known for 2 years has always been very skinny and I have had concerns of an eating disorder many times before. However recently it has got out of control and after seeing her lately her hair looks very thin and you can distinctively see the bones of her face and neck to the point that I can see no flesh in these areas.In the past 3 days she tells me she has undereaten and she is underweight. The reason for me suddenly getting so concerned is due to her becoming very sick in the last 3 days with vomiting, high heart rate and blood pressure, stomach problems/diarrhea, fatigue and dizziness when trying to do anything or stand up.We currently live in different countrys, her in Tunisia and me the UK. While we are applying for a visa, it is because of this that I can't really get an idea of the situation or get her help, her family doesn't really seem like they care and so I am a bit stuck on what to do.These are the main symptoms I have noticed that relate to anorexia or an eating disorder: - Rarely eats (but knows she has a problem with eating and does not think she is fat or ugly)- When she does eat it is only from foods on her "safe" list - She never leaves her bed and will not leave the house for days - She is always tired even when I have been with her in person - She has tiny thin hairs growing all over her body, in places where you would not expect it like the upper areas of the face - She can become dizzy or weak - She has literally no energy to do anything.One thing that confuses me is she accepts she is underweight and that she does not eat enough, **but she does nothing about it**, she often blames her parents for not caring or making her food. But I always try to explain to her that she needs to look after herself.When we meet in person and she is eating at the same time as me she normally eats fine, in the 2 weeks I was there she put on so much weight but it is when I am not there that she does not eat.I am very concerned and really hope I can get some help and advice on what to do.Thank you.
TL:DR; I think I need help but I don't know if it's an eating disorder or not.  I don't know what is wrong with me.  Please help.Background:(20F) I've grown up in a household where food=love and you finish everything on your plate, the only portion size is the whole plate and if you don't eat everything there's something wrong with you and EVERYONE makes sure to ask if you're okay. Exercise isn't important, sports aren't encouraged. I didn't care for a while, and I've been borderline overweight my whole life.  I'm in college studying exercise science now, and I decided if I was going to be in the exercise field that I would have to make a change in my life.  So, in January I started my journey to lose weight and become healthy.  I started a Pilates regimen.  And the calorie counting started.  I learned about resistance training and really fell in love with how I felt.  I lost a good amount of the weight that I was planning on losing in about 7 months.  As time has gone on and I've gotten into the meat and potatoes of my major, I've decided I want to be a personal trainer and work in the fitness world.I have found that I've developed a weird relationship with food, though.  I was able to plan out all my meals at home, but now at school, food just gives me anxiety.  I'm not purging, but I've been on the verge.  I find I get into this mode where I eat a lot at the dining halls or bring food up to my dorm and half of me is enjoying it and the other half is screaming, trying to tell me to stop.  But I can't listen to it.  Then I wake up in the morning and cry and hate myself for undoing everything I have been working for.  I over think about what I'm eating; I either eat EXTREMELY healthy or EXTREMELY unhealthy because my mind can't find a balance. I think everyone in the dining hall is keeping track of what I'm putting on my plate.  That's probably because I look at what everyone else is eating and compare it to what I'm eating.  I've gotten to the point of where I've just put that screaming voice in the back of my mind and I'm trying to ignore it and "feed my soul".  But it keeps coming back, giving me immense anxiety.I don't want to diagnose myself with something so severe when I don't have any anorexic or bulimic symptoms.  But I can't live like this and I want to continue to healthily work for the goal body that I want.  I don't know how to talk about this.Do I have an eating disorder? Do I need help?
Hello :) I need some advice.. Essentially I've been actively anorexic since I was 16, now 20. I've either been gaining weight as an inpatient or losing when discharged, being healthy is completely alien, but I decided to really try at recovery this June. It only took a couple of weeks and I was pregnant! I guess I just completely forgot it was possible or something? Not used to periods!Anyway, that only reinforced my efforts to recover, but now I don't fit in any of my clothes, am feeling out of control, and I still don't know how to be healthy. I literally don't know how to eat on my own. It's like my mind seizes up at the thought of making food for myself, so I put it off all day until my boyfriend comes home in the evening when I end up eating loads of junk food with him, takeaways and donuts and that kind of thing.I don't know how to explain this to anyone in real life because they all think I'm doing so well, but I feel like all the junk food is making me gain too much weight anyway, and I just keep thinking of losing all of it as soon as I give birth, which is really selfish and horrible.How do I get into a decent routine, and how do I feel more stable when I've gained so much already? How do I make myself eat and how do I make healthy choices for myself in the evening?
I've been anorexic or bulimia-like phases in some form or another since I was 12, which for me means I've never had regular periods. Since I started recovery, I've now had three (just started). I feel a bit odd being a 24 year old woman asking period questions but I was wondering if anyone had experiences to share concerning restarting and hormonal imbalances trying to come to a place of homeostasis. It feels pretty cruddy/triggering to be on my period in general - sort of reminds me of the pain and mood that led me to anorexia and that I associate with anorexia in the first place.Is there anything to be done to help in the meantime? I'm taking something for hypothyroidism, adrenal function and to balance progesterone/estrogen (my estrodiol is very high compared to my progesterone) and I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm concerned about the pain and frustration being triggering.
I'm rather panicked right now. I've more or less started slipping. I've been frustrated with myself so much lately--I've been hospitalized more times than I can count, and spent half a year in long term treatment, almost died, yaddah yaddah. All that doesn't really matter now.I just started college this year, and I've felt more and more 'up': that's just how I've always described it. I don't sleep much, and often forget to eat, or feel that there are more productive things I could or should be doing. I have boundless energy, and never really stop going.All this is drastically different from my past struggles with anorexia, and I don't know what to make of it. I see a nutritionist every other week on an outpatient basis, and I've been stable and doing well up until about a month ago. I go in today, and I find out I've dropped into the latter half of my 'yellow zone' (I'm super mature, so we have a traffic light analogy. Cool, I know).Part of me is surprised. Another part is panicked, and just generally angry with myself; even with all that, there's another part that keeps saying, "Well, you still weigh X, that's not so bad, is it? Remember last fall?" I am underweight, yes, but not so badly as I have been in the past. There's a messed-up mindset that wants me to maintain this weight, because I think I know how to handle this now--that I know how to 'save myself'. I wouldn't have many options left for treatment anyway: there's no way my health insurance would cover a residential treatment again, and one of the two inpatients in my state has implied that they do not want me for a sixth time.It's not that bad yet--but the key word there is yet. I want to intervene, but I feel like I'm watching a videotape of a car crash. On a level I know it's real, but it still seems so falsified, so non-threatening. I can't look away. I don't know what to do.Any advice? Experiences? I feel like I'm losing my mind all over again, and this is but the beginning. It started as an accident, but now I don't know if it's under my control any more. I need to stop it before it gets bad.
I suffered from binge-purge bulimia from the age of 17-24. I have been in recovery for a year and am relatively happy with my progress. I have had a few relapses but overall things are looking up. This is something I have achieved mostly through internet guidance and friends etc. I have not sought professional help.Whilst I have managed to stop purging and my body acceptance is improving, healthy eating and bingeing are still areas in which I struggle. Previously meal planning (3 meals and 2 snacks at set times) helped. However, I was still in a weight loss mind set and inevitably the meals I set myself were restrictive and I returned to binging.I want to include foods I considered 'bad' into my meal plan. For example, deserts and snack foods. I think I know a healthy portion size I just don't know what a healthy frequency to eat these foods is. Would it be 1 or 2 treats a week, or 1 treat a day? The problem in all of this is I don't really know what it means to eat healthily. I know what healthy foods are and what healthy meals are I am just extremely unsure how to incorporate foods I've always thought of as bad and thus used for binges. I know eliminating them isn't the answer but I've no idea how to include them.Any advice greatly appreciated.*edit: when replying, please avoid labeling specific foods and calories. Saying it is a desert or snack food or general label is important for those in recovery.*
I don't really know where to start with this as I've never really talked openly about it, so apologies in advance if I don't make much sense...Ever since I remember I've always had issues with food and my self esteem. But because of my lengthy and mostly undiagnosed relationship with food, I thought it was just the norm.However, after weight changes and suicide attempts, my therapist managed to open up these issues that I've been repressing and consciously not thinking about for so long.I'm currently 20, I should add, and last year I was officially diagnosed with the eating disorder EDNOS due to the behaviour I displayed in the past and present.I was referred for counseling however I didn't find it helpful at all, with the counselor's first words being, "I'm not here to give you advice, I'm just here to listen to whatever you say." That kind of therapy has never worked with me and needless to say, I didn't return back.Since that appointment, I've not had any eating disorder specific therapy so I still have millions of questions that were left unanswered - one of them relating to this awful guilt I carry around with me every day.I'll explain. Around 4-5 months ago, I was pretty much forced into recovery because of the huge list of stomach problems I experienced from my actions.But with this, I feel like I've gone to the opposite end of the spectrum. From barely-eating to eating everything in sight.I currently I feel like I'm eating so, so much - and that terrifies me. I know that I've put on weight but I don't dare step on the scales to find out how much.My question is, how on earth do I get rid of this guilt and self loathing over what I eat? And how do I control these binges?I'm sorry to waste your guys' time, I know there's more important things out there and if you've been patient enough to read it all, I salute you.tl;dr - Had/have an eating disorder, was forced into recovery because of medical issues and the consequent weight gain, big appetite and binges is killing me with guilt. How do I cope when I feel more out of control than ever?edit: please notify OP, /u/capturarmi when you reply here.
I have recently been diagnosed by a therapist with EDNOS based on my obsession with calorie and carb counting, binge eating, and body dysmorphia. I noticed something was wrong with my eating habits when I started eating in the middle of the night last year, waking up to food wrappers all around me the next day. I had dieted before but things became obsessive after I stopped drinking due to alcoholism. The night eating turned into daytime binging, hiding food, and eating on many calories in a sitting. I was ashamed of myself and would hide what I was eating from my roommate. I remained relatively stable in my weight because I was spending about a lot of time in the gym, every day.I never thought I had an eating disorder; I just thought I was super conscious about food and dieting and exercise and the binging stuff was a self-control issue. When my therapist told me I had an eating disorder, it was startling and upsetting because I was already seeing her to work on other issues (see above). Anyway, at her behest, I haven't been restricting my diet in any way for about two weeks now, but I only feel like my eating habits and my body shape are getting worse. I have been binging less frequently but I just purged. I've tried it before and don't like it, but I feel really anxious about my eating habits right now and I'm afraid that I might continue doing it anyway.I guess I'm wondering how a pattern of purging starts and whether I'm making myself worse by following my therapist's advice? I definitely feel safer and calmer when I'm dieting, even if it does have a tendency to bring out the binging in me. She wants me to see a dietician soon but I feel like I already know what's best for me and my body and it's really hard to rid myself of these kinds of thoughts, even if I know they're irrational and harmful.Should I listen to my therapist and see a dietician? I feel so anxious when I follow her advice.Does it sound like I have an eating disorder? Is this a problem, I mean, what could happen?
I've been in the restriction/binge cycle for years, with brief periods of recovery followed by relapse. I'm really getting sick of this so I'd like to go at it again with all my energy. My question is - how, not what, do you eat? Do you eat 3 meals a day at specific times? Do you eat when you feel a pain in your stomach (which may happen to be at any random, arbitrary time during the day)...? I have no idea where to start in regards to this, other than that I need to stop all food restriction immediately. Thanks
So first I'll share my story, about how it all happened. I started off back in May of 2012, I was very overweight and wanted to lose the weight and change my life. I started to exercise and eventually limit my meals. Around April of 2013, I had gotten myself down to a pretty low weight with an alright bodyfat percent.Then I started to get irritable and uncomfortable with my eating. I would be hungry all day and it would bother me to the point that I was always thinking about it. This was strange to me because I had been doing the same thing for  months with steady results and absolutely no problems when randomly it started bothering me very badly. After a week or so of this I decided to switch to eating the three meals a day like normal but since I was eating more throughout the day I started counting calories and restricting my intake by a lot while in the meantime way over-exercising. This carried on for about two months.Then my first binge happened. It was while spending a weekend at my friend's hunting camp and getting drunk for the very first time that I started binge eating and I still deal with it today in October of 2014. I've gone through many diet styles, and the one thing that stays the same is that I count calories still. I honestly don't mind doing it. I find it fascinating knowing what I'm eating and such. I've been through a variety of patterns with binge eating, I could go 12 days without doing it then boom, it happens, I could go three days, I could go 7 days, I've even been 16-21 days without a problem so obviously mine isn't as bad as some people's. So with all that being said, **how can I control this problem of binging?** what can I do to stop the occasional time that I do it. It doesn't happen as frequently as it does for a lot of people but it still feels like it rules over my life. The constant stress of wondering when the next one will happen is enough to stress me out a lot. **How can I get peace of mind?** I'm in the US Navy currently and do not have any idea how this could affect me in that. If I need to get out in order to get help or to do whatever it is that I need to do then I will take it in to heavy consideration. However, it would be greatly appreciated if you guys could give me your advice based on what you now know of me and anything you think might help me towards the right path of recovery.
I'm 17 and since I was 7 I've had a very negative relationship with my body and due to that a negative relationship with food, hating it and constantly seeing myself as overweight (though every time I see a photo from 1+ years ago I think I'm skinny in them). About five years ago I began heavily restricting what I ate and exercising a lot, I just recently felt comfortable calling what I experienced an eating disorder though I was never diagnosed.About a year and a half ago I got out of a relationship because my SO had become very stressed being the only one knowing about my ([still]undiagnosed) ED and having me use him as an important support and at the same time feeling anger towards him because he was working so hard to protect me from my ED. Due to that breakup I focused all my energy on eating normally and feeling better. I had been 1 year of normal eating and occasionally feeling better about my body(best in the ten year time frame) and all of a sudden I noticed myself restricting again and having awful thoughts again. A week or so ago someone had pointed out I'd gained weight so I've been triggered really badly. I'm scared of all this but it's not near as bad as it had been so I keep passing it off and this time I haven't told anyone (including current SO and close friends who know about past) because I'm ashamed as they're all so proud of my progress.Is it worth it to talk to a professional? Or will they laugh and think I'm making up an ED?
I have been with my girlfriend for over a year and had been her best friend for 7 years before we began dating. Gladly, we trust each other more than anyone else and share every possible thing. At the moment we have a Long-Distance relationship that will last for the next 4 years with some breaks. It is not an easy experience, but we can cope with that, since we have mutual and certain plans for our future: getting married, having children, creating a somewhat healthy family.Now, having depicted the context, I will explain the problem. For the past three years my girlfriend has encountered ED. It all began with her heart broken by some guy and a sudden following decision that she is no longer satisfied with her body. In reality, she has always been perfectly fit, even more of a skinny girl, before something clicked in her head three years ago and she began to lose weight drastically.Her diet changed insanely. She went from eating averagely to undereating. Moreover, now she only certain foods. Furthermore, she vomits several times a day.As I see it, currently she is as thin as she can possibly be. She is a skin and bone, but still sees herself as fat. She is completely disgusted with the way she looks and can spend an unlimited amount of time in this hysteric condition caused by her disappointment with herself. She hates those underweight models shown on TV and in various magazines and gets upset every time someone is talking about anyone's appearance.Her ED has caused a lot of problems in our relationship. There were the break-ups, the 'being-angry-for-no-reason' moods, etc. Now I understand that her ED was probably the one and only reason for this to have happened. Now everything is fine, but her resentment towards herself has not gone anywhere. About three months ago she had some kind of addiction to one light drug, because it helped her to somehow forget her ED-related stress, but, gladly, it is in the past.One more important thing that I'd like to tell. About 6 months ago she finally made a decision to visit a psychologist. I would say it made things even worse. The psychologist suggested a theory that her ED is caused by the fact that her mother doesn't love her. Which is the last fucking thing one should say unless one knows the situation in every detail (I am sorry for the language). Her mother loves her, but she has some hard time communicating with her daughter. Since the psychologist said that, my girlfriend has begun to take her mother as an enemy. For no complete reason. Moreover, the psychologist decided that my girlfriend is insecure towards our relationship. This thought, put into her mind, led to our parting for 2 months.1 month after this visit she attended a psychotherapist who prescribed her some antidepressants and other medicine. She took it for some time and then gave up because she thought that these pills make her fatter.There is a lot more to tell, but I at least hope that this background is enough to understand the situation. If everything else can throw light on the solution, I am ready to answer anything in the comments.Fellows, I beg you for advice or any help. I would do anything in the world that lies in my power to make this woman feel better. The fact that she can suffer not only psychologically, but also physically from the ED, terrifies me. I love her more than anything and hope this nightmare ends as soon as possible.I am very, very grateful for your attention and patience.
I have been dating a wonderful woman for about 6 months now. We spend most of our time together and enjoy all kinds of activities. We have traveled to visit breweries, go to concerts and see each other’s family. Apart from the strains of a normal relationship I’d say we are really happy.She let me know early on that she has had trouble with AN a year before we started dating. From what I understand she attended group therapy but never individual therapy. She says she is underweight and working on it. From there I never pressed her on anything and just let her talk about ED stuff if she wanted to. If it seemed to be troubling her I would always try to change the subject, talk about future day to day plans or bring up a memory from earlier. The reason I am writing this is because of two situations that happen that I have no idea how to react to. Sometimes when we are intimate she will comment on her body in a negative way (saying she’s too thin, too underweight), I used to brush it off and disagree and say she is beautiful. (I never knew if this correct. I know it is bad for her to be underweight, but I also know it’s bad for her to have that kind of self image.) Recently I set a boundary that I didn’t want her to comment on her own body if it didn’t come from a position of love (thank you /u/womanhealthyself). After she thought about it she came around to that idea. But recently she has started to comment on her own body in a negative way again. And I don’t know how to take it. Another thing that happened is one of my family recently joked with her about how she was so thin, It was in a joking manner about the temperature changing outside and she took it that way. But I heard it and was absolutely livid and didn’t know what to do. She saw how upset I was after that and asked me what was wrong but I brushed it off.Can anyone offer advice on how to handle this?
I've been suspicious of this for the first month or so of school, but it's come to my attention that one of my roommates is very likely to have an eating disorder (a roommate saw her take an infinitesimal ration of food before putting it on her plate). She eats extremely tiny portions, stays in her room with the door locked, and has spent long times in the bathroom before. Last year she looked healthy, this year she is extremely thin, so it has been a stark change.I'm friendly as I can be, but not friends with her. One of my roommates is friends with her, but not willing to address this. I don't feel like I could bring up such a sensitive topic without crossing a sort of boundary, but if nobody else is willing to introduce her to a resource, I will do it.What can/should I do to make her coping and hopeful recovery as comfortable as possible? Does having a conversation with someone directly inflame things?It's so difficult to tell anyone what they should do in an environment like college, but I can't ignore or rationalize this any longer.Has this kind of question been answered before? If so could you direct me to the discussion? If not, it would mean a lot for you to post it.
I'm in recovery for anorexia and I'm starting to realize that a lot of my tastes in food have changed. Food I used to love is a lot less desirable, and other foods that I never liked I'm enjoying. I find myself eating and craving a lot of different things now. Is it normal for anorexia to change someone's food preferences? Are my tastes really changed or is ED playing tricks on me?Also, lately I've making and craving odd food combinations, enjoying these things, what most people would deem abnormal, more than I enjoy combinations that are considered regular. This makes me feel abnormal and makes me isolate myself during eating pretty frequently. Is this detrimental at all? Has anyone else experienced this? Why are these strange shifts in taste happening and how can I reverse them? Should I reverse them?
Not sure if I have an eating disorder or not, but in high school I finally achieved a healthy weight. Now, I am at the high end of a healthy weight for my height and I am going to be a junior in college. I took the semester off to recover but have not made much progress. Perhaps on a spiritual and emotional level I have. I'm a bit more of an optimistic, however, I am in a restrict-binge cycle. I read Brain over Binge by Kathryn Hanseen. I don't know what to do.I wake up in the night three times, at 1 am, at 3 am and at 6 am. Every night. I was considering taking anti-depressants but I prefer natural methods. I know mental health stigma is a thing and I'm a psychology major but I want to heal myself.A part of me understands every conceptual aspect about this, and a part of me doesn't. I joined Weight Watchers and thought it would help, but the tracking leads to failure feelings. Same with my fitness pal. So now I wrote down a schedule with meals times because I eat erratically. However, I've been suffering for two years. I have no idea what to fucking do. How can I help myself overcome my possible eating disorder?What can help to get over depression?I am lost. Please help me.
So I'm thinking about starting to talk to someone and get help, but I'm finding it overwhelming to try to find someone. I was hoping maybe you guys had some recommendations for good ED related therapists in the Ft Collins, CO area. Also, if anyone has any suggestions for the best ways to go about looking in general, I would be very thankful.
My roommate is struggling with an ED, and her family isn't taking a lot of initiative to help. As her roommate, and therefore the person who spends the most time with her, a lot of responsibility has fallen to me to help her get back on track. Her parents have given her the ultimatum that if she doesn't show progress by the end of the semester, they are taking her out of school to move home (which I support). Here are some specific questions I have:  * What should I do to help her understand that she needs professional help?  * Should I take the responsibility of monitoring her eating and making sure she's getting enough calories and nutrients every day?  * What are some good foods for her to incorporate into her diet? I heard avocados are high in (good) fats. Thanks to anyone who responds.
So for the past 2-3 years, I have been recovering and relapsing. I will physically recover (gain weight), get my focus back, try to be genuine and inspired and say "okay! Let's start ____ (insert goals here)." then this empty feeling takes me over and I say "...but I can't do that at this weight, I just gained a little too much - I'll just lose a little and then I'll feel more able to do (goals). If I just didn't weigh so much, I could do that."and of course, once I'm losing, I want to keep losing. I KNOW better. I know that losing weight won't do anything for me.but still, then I'll hit a low weight, shake my head and say, "What am I doing to myself?! I have to get better. How can I ever do anything/ be anything when I'm like this."Repeat. the. cycle.I have identified that this "stuckness" makes it so that I don't have to deal with my issues, triggers, etc. "Afraid of succeeding" - I don't know. How can someone even be afraid to succeed? I have this illusion of getting better for a short while, not working on any self-help or therapy though - just gaining the weight back...I've been to therapy and I don't know how to "do" therapy. I've even gone through a long period of recovery where I was nearly without ED thoughts for a year, but I still was hiding myself away and not trying to succeed at my goals, truly. I realized I'm not only holding my own life back, but my fiance's life back.Why am I so afraid of everything. :( I guess this is more of a vent because therapy is probably all anyone will suggest, which is easier said than done.Has anyone else found themselves in this kind of a cycle and what did you do?? Any response is greatly appreciated (even if you do just suggest therapy, no hard feelings lol)
I've been bulimic for just about four years now. It's driving me insane I can't do this anymore and I decided to take my first step towards getting help. Since I'm a bit of a wuss, I decided to write a letter to my mom instead of speaking in person. I'm 21 so I see her over major holidays when I'm home from college.I never gave her the letter, and I hid it underneath a jewelry box on my bed. However, while I was gone, I guess my mom got professional carpet cleaning in my room, which required her to get all the furniture out of my room and in the process she found the note.Here's what I think is weird. I listed on 2 pages, front and back, in a handwritten letter, the details of how bad this disorder has gotten for me, some of the ramifications I have noticed, and expressed my desire to get help.She never mentioned it at all when I came home next, and I just found the note on my desk in the open, clearly found, and with no response.Please don't assume my mom is an uncaring person because she really is and I feel like I can talk to her about anything and get support, but I'm really confused why she is acting out of character with this subject. There's no history of eating disorders in my family, etc.Anyway, my original point is that I made this huge courageous effort to tell someone about what I'm dealing with and it's almost like I never said anything at all. Because of this, my binging and purging has gotten awful. Today I had 3 separate binge/purge episodes. I feel sick.What sort of steps can I do to get help? I'm an adult so I don't really need my parents involved in this although I wouldn't mind being honest at this point and having them involved. Sorry for such a long story thank you for any help. x
Hi,I have Binge Eating Disorder and I would like to know what things have helped people recover from it; whether it's: -Therapy (please list type of therapy) -Self-Help workbooks, psychology books (please list these books) -Personal trainer -Slimming clubs e.g. Weight Watchers"
I have bulimia. It’s been pretty predominant in the past 5 years, right after my daughter was born. I've noticed that my habits have gotten severely worse since I had to move back home with my mother a year and some months ago. Finding myself behaving at work on most days, but the urge overcomes me on the ride home. The stress of my living situation and the toxic things my mother says to me on a daily basis creep up in the form of a purge. Even if I haven’t eaten much, I will do it. It’s not a weight thing. This has been my way of coping with stress. Just this year is when I finally started to read up on the consequences and have thought to myself “If I ever found out my daughter was doing this, I’d fall to pieces.” My mother knows about the condition and she’s awful at dealing with it. She just yells at me every time I go upstairs “Don’t throw up!”… Yeah. That helps. It makes me angry because she doesn’t even try to understand. She thinks it’s an image thing when it’s so much more complicated than that and she’s one of the main causes of my stress. My older sister makes negative comments every time she sees me like “Seriously? You need to gain weight. Eat!” It tends to be anger and hopelessness that trigger my purges. I have maybe four people including my mother who know I have this disorder. Only one of which has truly spoken out with concern and wants to help me any way they can. But with all the outside voices and my minds voice telling me “you’ll stop tomorrow”… I become this twister just blowing through the evening pretending I’m OK while using the bathroom multiple times a night. Sometimes my evenings are a blur. When I don’t have my daughter, I tend to be way worse. How I can stop the negative and misunderstanding voices from affecting me? I feel like I would do so much better if they all went silent.
My girlfriend has an ED and recently this has brought tension into our relationship. I was away for a while recently and upon returning home she indicated to me that she was managing her ED better without me around. Because of this she wants to end our relationship. I want to be as supportive as possible, but the thought of losing what we have together is painful. Just looking for more information, thank you.
I am a therapist interested in improving eating disorder treatment and recovery. Survey should take less than five minutes.Survey:https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KQ56TFW
Moment to moment, meal to meal, how do you stay motivated for recovery?
I am not sure if I have an eating disorder or not but eating and feeding myself is a chore. I hate everything about it to the point that I end up not eating for long periods of time and then eat junk food because it is quick and easy. Are there any suggestions for meal services (delivery or pickup) that require little cooking for a feasible budget? $400. Most meal delivery services are diet services and I definitely do not need a weight loss meal plan.
In my life, I have been a dancer, a martial artist, and overall have just truly enjoyed working out and eating healthy (learning about nutrition, etc). One day, however, I realized I had bulimia. My cycles were: binge-eating, feeling stuffed or fat, purging, feeling a great sense of control and high, then feeling crappy about myself.This was years ago, and after many years of research and seeking support, realizing how traumatic things in my past contributed to the disease, I now still binge sometimes (a lot less), but I haven't purged in many years. I call myself a "recovering bulimic."The thing is, I still enjoy exercise and eating healthy, but how do I know the difference between me just seeking health or being obsessive? Where can I draw the line?For alcoholics, you count the days that you haven't drank as milestones, but how does someone addicted to food count their milestones? Not eating is not good, so do I just count the days since I've last binged? How do I efficiently classify if I was just really hungry or emotionally eating?
I don't know if I have an eating disorder or if I'm just trying to eat healthier.Hi, I'm a Freshman college student and ever since I've graduated high school I've been dropping weight. The pre-scheduled meals regulated by the government made me feel safe, especially when surrounded by peers eating the same thing. However, now I have to independently prepare my own lunch and every time I eat lunch I feel like I'm poisoning my body.On one side, I'm just looking for health foods that are affordable and suitable for a college student still living with his parents, but on another side, I just want to live one day where I don't think about calories, saturated fats, sugars, cholesterol, exercise, monounsaturated fats, artificial sugars, carbohydrates, fiber, and the glycemic index. I don't know if this is anorexia, but I know it sure as hell isn't healthy.For breakfast and lunch I eat healthy meals.For dinner, my parents still have control over what will be prepared. It's usually unhealthy and homemade, but I still eat everything because I'm starving at this point.After dinner, I've been trying to eat more just so I don't go to be feeling hungry. Lately, I've been snacking on healthy foods that should help me gain weight.I live every day stressing on what I've eaten, knowing there are holes in my diet and knowing that there will be holes the next day. My parents don't care about healthy eating (my dad specifically told me he lives to eat, not the other way around), yet I'm at a point where I feel I need a secure, regulated diet that makes sure I can gain weight in a healthy manner.Welp, I rambled and didn't keep things brief...I'm terribly sorry for making you have to read all of this. I don't know what condition I have, and I don't know if it's curable, I just know I want to live a day without regretting what I've eaten.Can anyone suggest what I can do about this?
I have been to two treatment centers for my eating disorder the past few years and neither of them seem to work for me. I have been recommended to go to inpatient treatment multiple times. I'm interesting in Timberline Knolls and I looked on the google reviews and they all seemed misleading. Is there anyone who can give me an honest and unbiased opinion on Timberline Knolls?
potential TW ~~~~~~~~~~ I'm a somewhat long time sufferer of what I guess is an eating disorder. I think I'm in recovery.Due to some unremarkable treatment staff, I've never really been diagnosed with an eating disorder, or disordered eating. My current outpatient treatment team (consisiting of a therapist and a psychiatrist that also communicate with another psychiatrist that specialises in diagnostic testing and evaluation, he was not authorised to evaluate my medical state, and could not give me an eating disorder diagnosis) agrees that my previous diagnoses of Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and OCD are not accurate.I don't know why no one has diagnosed me yet. Anytime I bring it up they are just like "don't worry about it". Why don't they care about diagnosis?But that's my tangent. Here's my question. I've been restricting my intake with occasional purging, and some over-exertion physically on and off since I was about eleven or so, and used food or the absence of it as a self-soothing technique (however unconsciously) since I was about seven or eight. I've taken IQ tests in the past, and have always tested well above average. I've always succeeded in school and work environments. I graduated high school two years earlier than scheduled. I'm now at a community college. I have high A's, am currently working in retail, and manage to do social things. That said, none of this comes easy anymore. I sleep maybe four or five hours a night, interrupted. My brain constantly feels shrouded in this thick fog. I notice a direct correlation to my mental state/ disordered behaviour patterns, and my performance in work and school. I read sentences five or six times just to even comprehend the topic. Sometimes I can't focus on the whiteboard or projector or test and just sort of sit there, desperately trying to recall information, or even just trying to understand what I'm looking at. Walking up/ down stairs or hallways at school feels like a horrible labyrinth. Using the ladders at work or trying to remember the three-digit item numbers as I walk to the back just feel like torture. I'm still new at my job, and am being taught all these things that I immediately forget.What's happening to me?Is this fixable?I was, at the age of seven, learning quantum physics and fluent in Spanish. Now, it's extremely difficult to do short- answer questions on quizzes.Can someone please explain what's happening? I can't go on like this. Is my lack of concentration due to my restricting?
This is the opposite of what is usually asked, but I have had a long term eating disorder, still going on but trying to get better and I have an amazing supportive boyfriend that tries his absolute hardest to help me. Sometimes I get very scared its going to be too much for him though so I was wondering if any of you boyfriend/girlfriend/friends who are supporting have any tips for how I can make it a bit easier for him. What do you appreciate? Should I try to have days when I don't talk to him about it at all or is there something else that makes you feel better or stronger in the battle against this? I understand it must be very hard for all of you, I know for sure though that my boyfriend has helped me so much so I'm immensely happy I have him. 
I am obese and I have started trying to lose weight, but I'm not having much success. I keep cycling through episodes of restricting, binging, restricting heavily to compensate, binging again, then giving up until I decide again that I want to lose weight.Sometimes I chew up desserts and spit them out to sort of compensate for the binges, and I have recently attempted to make myself vomit because I ate too much at dinner. I don't know if I just have really bad habits or if I have a real problem, and I don't know if I need help or not. Whatever this is, I know it isn't normal, and I'm getting really sick of cycling through these episodes. I want and need to lose weight, but it's not going to happen if I keep doing this. I just don't know how to make myself stop.Am I developing an eating disorder? How can I stop these cycles?
I am a clinical psychology doctoral student, details in survey, doing research on binge eating. I am recruiting participants to take an on-line survey about their eating history and current eating habits. It is my hope that by improving the assessment of eating behavior, the selection of appropriate treatments and the successful application of those treatments will also improve.

I am a 19yo male with Selective Eating Disorder, and would appreciate any support. I have been suffering from SED since I was a child, and for the longest time I couldn't put a name to my disorder. I had been raised being told I was picky, but I knew this wasn't the case. I feel awareness is very low for this disorder, I've always struggled to explain how I can't just eat most things, even though I'd love to be able to.For me, this disorder isn't related to any type of body dismorphic disorder. This wiki page will help explain it: [SED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avoidant/Restrictive_Food_Intake_Disorder).I have yet to be professionally diagnosed, and am posting to see if anybody else has had the disorder? Also, what can I expect from any therapy I receive?Much thanks!
I hope it's okay to post this here. I've had binge eating disorder for almost 3 years, occasionally with compensatory behaviour (exercise, fasting, purging). I'm still not really sure how it happened, but recently I managed to stop bingeing and haven't done for 2 months now. However last week I had a lot to eat (but not a binge) and too much to drink and as I was feeling kind of nauseous anyway I decided to purge. It seemed like everything had been fine up until then. Afterwards all these horrible thoughts I'd been blocking out came flooding back to me and now I can't stop thinking that I want to stop eating again, I wish there was a way to purge without harming yourself, I keep looking at pro-ED sites and thinking about ways to make myself vomit. I know that none of it makes sense but I find myself envying anorexics. This is making me very worried about myself. It's like there's an argument in my head between the rational side of me which knows if I don't eat properly my college work will suffer, I'll feel ill and tired and probably won't even lose much weight; and the ED side which wants that thrill of feeling empty and counting the hours since you last ate again. The only thing stopping me at the moment is a fear that undereating will lead to more bingeing, which I would not be able to deal with after having done well these past few weeks. If anyone can help me on how to get rid of these intrusive thoughts please comment.
I recently met someone online and she's told me about her history with anorexia and since she has started back at school this semester she has been triggered by thin girls on campus and has fallen back into restrictive diet habits and over-exercising.I am at a loss since A) I have only just met her and B) I am one of the few people she has told about this yet probably the least educated about the subject and C) she lives hours away and so I can't support her except that we've been talking on the phone every day.How do I support her? I don't want to push her away, since I really like her and want her to be safe, but I don't want to condone and enable her anorexia by not speaking up when she mentions her harmful behavior and negative thoughts.Thanks in advance.
Seeing a doctor isn't financially an option for me right now and I haven't been examined since becoming bulimic.I was binging and purging almost every day, sometimes twice for a month straight. This was about 3 months ago. Since then I've been suffering from lingering stomach pains and nausea after every time I eat (usually it feels like my stomach is being burned by excess digestive acid), diarrhea has become more common than regular bowel movements, and I'll have it almost immediately after eating (I have to run to the bathroom).Last week I had the flu and I was starting to feel almost 100% so I gave myself allowance to get drunk (I know, not wise in the least bit) and, no surprise here, threw up and felt more sick than I had before drinking. It's been 3 days since then and I've been getting scared every time I get hungry because whenever I eat something its feels like I'm attacking my own stomach. My pains haven't been this intense since I first started my recovery.What have I done to my stomach and how can I help myself? Also what should I eat? (Mod note: there are no "bad" foods) I replaced most of what I used to eat with fruits and veggies but it doesn't seem to have an effect. I couldn't find much out on google, but if you have any experience or knowledge about the effects of bulimia I would greatly appreciate your advice. Thank you.Edit: Please let OP /u/princessbaby420 know when you reply here.
I've had problems my entire life with my body and weight. (22/f)When I was younger (14-16), I didn't eat for extended periods of time to maintain the weight I was at. I have a hormone imbalance which got worse as I became a woman, and was put on birth control. This caused me to eat more and gain weight due to the medication.I guess the biggest 'wake-up call' I had was when I was weighed at the doctor 2 years ago and was very close to being overweight for my height and frame. I am small framed and on the shorter end of the spectrum.I proceeded to go have my birth control taken out because I believed that was the root of the problem and it was, to an extent. From there, I started restricting/undereating and exercising lightly. I have done this for the past year.I cannot sleep, I don't have an appetite, I've quit my job, I no longer have a desire for sex with my husband, I refuse most social interactions because I fear being judged or looking at someone smaller than me and then having my mind spiral into comparing myself to that person. I constantly look at my body in the mirror, hoping that it will be thinner and smaller than it was when I last looked. I'm now too tired to exercise or do much of anything, which makes me feel even worse. I already have GAD and a panic disorder, and I feel as if my anxiety has amplified.I have not had a period since I had the birth control implant removed in June. I do not know if this is because it takes a while to get your period back from being on the birth control or from my ED.I realize now what I'm doing to myself, and I'm scared that I've done something irreversible to my body. I know I need to be eating a lot more calories than I am, and I'm trying.I do not have insurance so I can't afford to go see a therapist or go into a clinic. I'm literally forcing myself to eat more and trying to shut my brain off when I feel negativity coming on. I do keep track of my calories, but only to make sure I'm eating enough a day.I'm also not underweight or even close to being underweight. But I'm so so so scared that I'm going to gain MORE while I'm trying to get my calories to maintenance level. That's what scares me the most.Does anyone have any advice on trying to recover on your own? Also advice on recovery and trying to stay in a healthy range when you're not underweight to begin with would be wonderful.
I learned not to have expectations about my birthday as a kid because the day usually ended with me being disappointed. Now that I'm an adult my birthday tradition is to take the day off from work and do whatever I want.For the last year or so, I've had problems with purging. I'm in therapy and on meds, but I have trouble believing I'm going to get through tomorrow without making myself throw up if I let myself have what I want. I wish I didn't crave the things that make me want to purge. (Did I mention I'm under a lot of stress due to big projects and changes at work and I'm getting ready to buy my first place? Oh, and I have PMS.)This year I asked my friends (not family) to send me stories from our friendships. It's been really touching to see how many have arrived. I'm going to read them tomorrow over my morning coffee.My relationship with my family is pretty fucked up and estranged right now. My parents are out of the country on vacation - glad I don't get to talk to them tomorrow.Any suggestions, support, or hugs to help me get through my birthday?
I'm not sure if I have an eating disorder, but a confirmation won't make me feel any better or worse. I do know that I have had disordered thoughts about eating and disordered behaviors related to eating ever since I started my first diet senior year of high school. It was keto and feeling restricted as I began college made me go crazy with food freshman year, and I gained the weight freshman often gain.I'm now in my junior year of college. Since freshman year I've been trying to get the weight off in healthy ways. I am now a little overweight. Sometimes I will succeed in being healthy. I tell myself that my body is for me. I do not need to lose weight. I should not worry about what I'm eating or how much. But then one day I don't like the number on the scale, or I felt that I ate the wrong thing or too much, and either I start binging or I start restricting.Freshman year I would purge. I finally got myself to stop doing that. But now I feel more guilty for binging, and I tell myself that neither purging nor restricting is healthy nor will help me lose weight.I stopped the purging by myself. And now I'm definitely not asking help in losing weight, but handling my thoughts about eating is not something I can do alone at this point. I just want to not worry about everything I eat to an extreme and it's becoming difficult. What should I do? Please advise!
How do I help a close friend who has been binging/purging?I am 25M and have a very close friend (21F) who admitted to me that she has been binging and purging since about ~May or maybe June. I am one of her closest (and oldest) friends, and she admitted this to me a few weeks ago. I asked her who else knew, and apparently not a soul knows. Her girlfriends don't know, and most shocking to me is that her own mother doesn't know (she has a very good/tight relationship with her mom). Obviously I'm not going to break her trust by telling anyone else, but I have no experience with this. I want to be able to say the right stuff and help my friend out, but I'm a clueless guy quite frankly.She has told me she didn't admit this to me because she wants me to help her, but I feel I have to do something. I will be the first to say that she's a beautiful woman who does not need to change her weight at all, and I would like some advice from redditors on what to do/say. She's telling me she's been getting nosebleeds from this, and I'm sure it's having other adverse effects.As I type this I realize that the time she started doing this coincides with her breaking up with her piece of shit boyfriend who effectively called her fat. So that's some pertinent information that I'll leave here.So as a concerned and caring friend, what do I do, reddit?
I have a male friend (29 y/o) who has been struggling to gain weight for over ten years. However he has been failing to gain any weight and is actually losing weight still. He is now very underweight. He desperately needs help and I'm at a complete loss on how to help. But there are a few key factors to take in here:He suffers from chronic depression, which only makes this worse for him and I'm starting to worry that he may do something harmful to himself. 1) He has no insurance of any kind. 2) Has no real support system set up except for his mom and myself. 3) Since he's a male, every time he goes to his mother for help or a general practitioner, they almost always just blow him off and tell him to just eat more 4) He is a chain smoker, which causes him to have a hard time eating, because according to him, most food tastes like ash. (he has tried to stop smoking, but it only seemed to worsen his depression) 5) Money as a whole is also fairly tight for him, which makes lack of insurance an even bigger problem 6) It's not that he doesn't eat. He may not eat as much as he needs to, but he does eat, and want to eat. But he for sure cannot eat as much as most people from the times I've spent with him. 7) He also does not exercise, and is seemingly against the idea, since he doesn't think it will help in any way because he is so small.Please, any help or suggestions will be greatly appreciated, I'm just really worried about my friend and don't want him to hurt himself or starve himself to death.
I have lost my period since March, when my ED started. This past month I have been back on the road to recovery, but i'm just curious as to when the usual amount of time it takes to get the period back after malnutrition. When is the average amount of time it takes? Any ways I can try to get it back faster?
I'm writing because I have suffered from a severe bout of depression the past summer due to multiple reasons. During this time, I lost my appetite, which I'm told is normal. However, I believe I have let this get a little out of control and now I am worried I might be developing an eating disorder. It has been months and I still have no appetite. I'm losing weight (I'm already low weight to begin with). When I do eat, its usually something really awful for me or its a very small amount each day. Any advice for this kind of situation?
I've been in recovery for 7 months. I've never kept a scale around because I'm too afraid to look at it. Yesterday I was in a rush and couldn't find a pair of tights to put on, so I grabbed a pair that I had poked away because they were too big. They fit now. They fit correctly. They hug every part of my body. It made me feel sick. I had a huge breakdown, skipped supper, and I stayed home from meal support today.How did you deal with weight gain in recovery? 
Since my recovery four years ago I have been doing well. No unhealthy behaviors. (Rather proud of that).Back at college and had a rather stressful year and I am start to think about food in a disordered manner again. (Although I am not yet acting out on these).Any advice to help me return to not fearing food, obsessing and feeling guilty all the time?Thanks guys.
Hi everyone,My gf and I have been together for almost 5 years, and she has lost some weight in the last year, she's underweight now. At first I didn't feel like it was important, like why not eating more veggies and losing some weight? But since, she has changed her habits drastically; she doesn't eat anything with sugar or any fatty food, and when it happens (practically never) that she eats some, feels guilty for the rest of the day, or even the day after. She counts the calories on the packages, wants to eat (and likes) "normal" stuff, but doesn't allow herself to, and she recently she has been feeling felt faint a few times.I have to mention that she has insulin-dependent diabetes (she has to control her blood sugar level), and that doesn't help, imo.I have always tried to be there for her, to support her, but it doesn't look like I can change anything, she doesn't like her body even though I've always said to her that I think she's beautiful (I genuinely think she is, I mean I don't say this just to comfort her).She told me recently that when I come (she lives in London, and I'm going to live there soon), I'd have to force her into seeing a "doctor", or whatever it is. Since she kinda wants it, it's obviously "easier" to get help, but what can I do, on my side, to help her? Do I avoid speaking about what she eats? About eating in general? Do I have to say "no it's not true" when she says "I'm fat"? Do I have to be the "boyfriend who speaks about anything but this"? I am worried and I need your help to be able to support her effectively. Thank you for your advices, redditors!
I have EDNOS - basically Anorexia, Binge-Purge type without being underweight. I would like to get better at reaching out for help before I binge and purge. Sometimes I think it would be easier to talk to an anonymous hotline instead of someone I know.I looked online and I found the National Eating Disorder Association. Their hotline is open Monday-Thursday, 9am-9pm and Friday 9am-5pm, Eastern Time.Does anyone have any suggestions for the other hours? I'm a survivor of child sexual abuse and I've called RAINN's hotline for issues related to that but I'm not sure how well they could handle an ED issue, even though my ED comes from my abusive childhood.
My friend told me he usually only eats once a day. He's antisocial and I think he might be scared to eat alone.I can't eat with him tho because he lives in a different dorm.What should I do to help him?
Background, 25 year old male, I Used to be a little bit overweight when I was around 13-17. I loved to eat and maybe even used it for some kind of comforting effect, but then started using drugs. I was sent to a facility for treatment. I began working out, as it was required, and others seemed to notice the weight loss. After a couple months I began to form a respectable physique. After being gently teased by friends about my weight when I was younger, this was a welcome change. I had some self confidence back. Various events took place and I found myself living in an apartment but could no longer afford a gym membership, my only sanctuary. I panicked and began to lower my intake so as to avoid gaining weight. I ate little, smoked a pack a day, and ran and did body weight exercises if I were to overeat. This became an obsession and I dropped down a substantial amount. One night my roommates were describing the 'look' they were going for with their bodies. I said I wanted to look athletic, and laughed and said I was going for the anorexic look. I was shocked because I thought I still looked too bulky. After awhile, I regained weight to my healthy body weight, due to an obsession for muscular growth, but am slipping back into old habits. I run a lot and undereat. When I do eat a normal amount I feel out of control and feel the need to do burpees or run until I almost faint. I'm dropping weight fast but almost don't want to stop. The weight loss is addictive. Any suggestions would be awesome
I want to know is when does someone know there was something wrong with their eating? I feel like I am straddling the line between strict dieting and full blown eating disorder but I'm not sure whether I'm dramatizing. I'm just curious about when people got the feeling of 'something is not right' and if it can be very early on. Can people tell if there is something wrong early on?

I use to be a college athlete, but recently suffered from a debilitating injury that put me through 3 surgeries and 8 months of physical therapy to learn to walk again. In that time I gained weight, and lost muscle. Since I recovered, I have been miserable about my weight and body. I hate being in pictures, and have felt even more miserable after being excluded from social events from my sorority sisters and former team mates. I cant stand looking in a mirror and it makes my anxiety shoot through the roof. I hate leaving my room.I started by trying to lose weight by exercising, but I can barely run a compared to what I used to. This upsets me more than anything. I recently realize I've been eating less and less until I eat almost nothing all day trying to diet. Occasionally I will eat a meal and then force myself to throw it back up. Other times I will eat a meal and keep it down fine. I really didn't think much of this (I've always been told "everyone does it") until my boyfriend confronted me on it, saying he was concerned I have an eating disorder. So do I have an eating disorder? Should I be concerned? I feel fine, am not under weight and don't think I have an eating disorder but he seems extremely upset by this and wants me to get help. Am I just to blinded to see it? 
Hi everyone. I suffered from a 7-month bout of anorexia in my senior year of high school. I was underweight. Nobody reached out to help me. I re-fed and recovered on my own. I lived on an island with no healthcare. Recovering was the most painful experience of my life, with water retention, bloating, joint pain, etc. But it was to save my own life.After anorexia, I struggled with bulimia for two years. I tapered off, and finally stopped purging two and a half months ago.I struggled with binge eating for a month because I was severely depressed. But I'm pretty good now.I'm seeing a psychiatrist twice a week, visiting a nutritionist once a week, and working closely with my primary care doctor to attend to any medical issues that come up.I'm on a leave of absence from college because I had a lot of anxiety, health, depressive, and ADHD symptoms.I'm wondering if anyone can help me identify common triggers to binge eating, purging, anxiety.I've been logging my mood swings so I can tell if maybe I have bipolar. Because I feel like my moods change drastically about every two weeks.I've been having recurring thoughts of purging for the past two days, and felt extremely fatigued, and self-loathsome. I just started a new job, but I want to cry because I feel like I can't do it. I'm starting to want to avoid all these stressful things again and just want to cry all the time because I'm afraid I'll never be successful this way.Can anyone point me in a direction of where to start taking care of myself? Suicidal thoughts are creeping in again. I have never given my stuff away or planned how I would kill myself, because I'm healthy enough to recognize these suicidal thoughts aren't mine, so I shut them out as soon as they come. But I write down when they do come so I can keep track of it, and communicate with my therapist.I was never suicidal before. This is a recent development since the beginning of 2014. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a year and a half, which I got out of mid-July.Just want some help being pointed in the write direction from anyone who's been through this before. Where did you start? What are some techniques you used to get yourself out of bed in the morning? To track your emotions? To deal with painful stimuli?Thanks in advance. Don't really know what I want from this, but anything goes.
My best friend is underweight and i know that she does not eat a lot. I am not sure weather she has bulimia or anorexia or just an uncompleted version. I want to help her but i don't know if i should talk directly to her, ask her how much/what she eats on a normal daily basis. Or if i should talk to her parents. I don't know if i should take a hand in the whole thing, as i don't want to offend her or her parents...What should I do?
Hi thereI am a nurse on a newly opened Eating Disorder Unit, I am new to the experience and am looking for tips on how I can best help people through this difficult time.Specifically I would like to know - If anyone has had any experience with long lasting residency programs - What you liked/disliked - What staff (all disciplines) did well/didn't do well. - What helped you through the program - Were there any groups or discussions that really helped? - Any literature you suggest? - And any general advice.Thanks!
I see a therapist who has been helping me with my relapse, but I sometimes feel like my husband doesn't help me.He is conscious of "not forcing" me to do things and "wanting me to be happy," so when I get in a state of being unable to bring myself to eat, we often end in arguments where he tells me "Fine, don't eat" or "It's your decision if you eat or not." Obviously you can guess what decision I make (I don't eat).How can I handle this? My therapist just keeps working on "hoping I can get over feeling like I need permission to eat," and my husband has staunchly said he won't ever force me to eat (not that I want this) and that he just wants me to do what makes me happy.What can I do to help my husband help me? What can I do to change the pattern with my therapist?
Recently the guilt of eating has been taking a toll on me. I had to start taking medication for a blood disorder I have, and one of the side effects is weight gain.I constantly look at pictures of myself from a few months ago when I was really sick with my blood disorder, and just think how good I looked then as opposed to now. I mean I was really sick a month ago, and to look at the pictures of myself then and feel good about how I looked kinda scares me.My meds made me gain weight and I'm not at an unhealthy weight, but I'm heavier now than I was before I was sick, and the meds cause me to constantly over eat. Lately whenever I eat I feel guilty, and when I 'forget' to eat it eases some of that guilt and I feel good. I regularly undereat, and I feel pride when I do. Sometimes I binge and eat a lot of food and snacks uncontrollably, and afterwards I feel like I've done something stupid and I strongly consider purging it, although I haven't done that yet. I worry myself sometimes as I've had a past of self harm and I know that I'm capable of doing something like this.I love to eat, and I've never had an 'ideal' size, or worried about fat and calories. Just for about 2 months, I look in the mirror and the person I see is not me. I don't like what I see, I'm constantly touching my cheeks and my stomach and worrying that it got bigger. Anyone else have to take awful meds with unwanted side effects? How do you deal with it? Should I be worried this could turn into a full blown eating disorder? Please help!
I really struggle with being honest with my therapist. I struggle with honesty related to my issues with anyone but at present my T is the only person I talk to. I have been managing to be pretty honest right now, but afterwards this triggers b/p because I feel so drained and emotional over it all and I've been lying about that by omission. I just don't write it in my food diary. I feel really bad about it, but I don't know what to do. Can anyone help?
I am currently at a healthy weight. In fact, my parents and my close friends tell me that I could stand to actually put on a few pounds. But, here is my story:About three or four years ago, I was very overweight for my age. I felt awful about myself, I had zero confidence, and I sunk into a deep depression that no one knew about. Honestly, to this day no one - not my family or friends - knows what a dark period I went through. I began binging and purging on a regular basis, but I noticed no change in my physical appearance. I started cutting myself and I remember considering overdosing on pain medication on more than one occasion. I was away at college...far from my family, friends, those who cared about me. I figured I could "slip quietly away" and no one would notice.I moved back home after two semesters and worked for the summer. That fall, I moved to Brazil and spent two years doing volunteer work there. It was a great time in my life. Because of the abrupt change in diet and all the walking (and sweating) I did, I lost quite a bit of weight. I noticed that my clothes were bigger and baggier. Then, I caught a stomach bug which brought on nausea with any food. I had to reduce my eating habits a lot which caused even more weight loss. Even though I was sick, I felt good about myself, about my weight, for the first time in my entire life.When I returned home, my family almost didn't recognize me because of all the weight I had lost. They tried to overfeed me because they wanted the "old me" back. I refused to eat such big amounts. I didn't want to gain any of the weight back. I still feel this way and I feel terribly guilty anytime I eat, or sometimes even crave, food that would be considered unhealthy. I am constantly counting calories, thinking, "If I eat this snack now...that means I can't eat dinner later tonight." If I go out to eat with my family or friends, rather than participate in the social aspects, all I can think about is the fats, or how many carbs and calories are in the dish. It makes me depressed. I spend several minutes in front of the mirror looking at myself after I dress. If I think my clothes somehow make me look overweight, I can't get that thought out of the back of my mind for the rest of the day. I'm not overweight...I know that. But I just can't get the fear out of my head of getting fat again. I worry about people looking at me and thinking to themselves that I am fat or that I could stand to get rid of my belly or something like that.I try eating healthy and, for the most part, I succeed. I eat smaller portion sizes and more natural foods. I really love fruits and vegetables. I exercise regularly. On days when I don't exercise, I fear eating anything because my brain somehow has been wired to think that any food I eat will make me fat. I undereat most days but I still feel sick and guilty when I eat. I HATE eating in groups because if someone notices that I'm not eating as much, they always comment, "Oh, what are you on a diet or something?" I get so self-conscious and I really need help. It leads me into depression and I lose self-confidence which really affects me negatively.Maybe this isn't the place for this, but I just really need to confess this. I need to get it off my chest. I've mentioned it in passing to my parents, to my sister, to my brother, but they blew it off like it was nothing. I never straight up said that I may have an eating disorder, but I've mentioned how much I dislike eating and how I worry about gaining weight and stuff like that. I need help. I know I do. Please, listen to me. Please, talk to me about this.I want to know:-How to not continually obsess over food?-How to get over anxiety of eating in front of other people?-How to develop a more positive self body image?-Specific things I can do to improve my mood and self-confidence?-Tips for overcoming anxiety and for how to be able to focus more on what I need to do day-to-day, rather than getting distracted by food or the way I see myself?
My girlfriend is bulimic and I have 0 experience with this. She hates herself when she does it and talks about tackling her issue in the future.I have thought a lot about things i can do to motivate her and encourage her. I am at a loss because i am unfamiliar and this issue is so deep seeded. I have come up with ideas, my latest one being to modify her bathroom scale (she weighs herself 8 times a day) so that it will only display numbers within a certain range.Any thoughts? I know this is probably an idiotic idea, but i am grasping at straws. I would love any advice you can give.
When is enough enough? I've been through this cycle so many times. So many pseudo-recovery attempts that aren't true attempts because even though I'm eating more and trying fear foods there are still too many rules and behaviors and under eating and every time I gain even just a small bit of weight I go right back to restricting.The more this happens, the more I think that maybe recovery just isn't for me. I'm terrified of being overweight again, terrified of being a normal weight again, terrified of being underweight but heavier than now.Sometimes I just want to be normal. I am in my 20s and see people my age going out and having fun. But then I also feel like I eat too much to have a serious problem, there are always people who restrict more and weigh less and my ED isn't serious enough to have to recover.I really don't know what to do. Can anyone tell me what made you change your mind and actually decide to recover? Not half-recovery but really do it? What was that turning point?
Hi Reddit,I will try to keep my story brief, so here it goes. When I was younger, I was a bigger kid, the type of kid that wore husky size pants to school. When I left for college, I was petrified of gaining the "freshman 15" and becoming even bigger, so I ended up eating little and dropping a few pounds. Sophomore year my weight rose, but the real issues started junior year. My weight sophomore year summer went down significantly, and between the weight loss and the amount of times I went to the gym, I felt great about myself and even better because everyone told me I looked awesome.The problem was, I lost the weight by not eating and then followed a horrible pattern junior year. I restricted a bit and then allowed binges. This had my weight fluctuating up to 10 pounds per week .Now that I am graduated from college and constantly surrounded by food at home, I can no longer keep this eating pattern. I am about the weight I was during sophomore year. During the week I still fluctuate a similar amount as it did my Junior year, but this fluctuation is due mainly to the fact that I can no longer starve myself at school because at home I have food surrounding me everywhere, so it is easier to binge (at school I kept absolutely no snacks in my dorm).I have tried a lot to solve this. Restricting works for a while before I binge, tracking calories only makes things worse because the number I am allotted a day feels like it is not enough and I end up binging due to the fact that once I start eating I want more, and I have also tried eating large breakfasts and toning down how much I eat all day, but by dinner I still get hungry and will binge 2/3 times a week.My question to you Reddit: is there anyway I can beat this without telling anyone but you? My friends and family do not suspect it; I am a very active kid who plays golf 3 times a week and hockey once a week as well as goes to the gym frequently, but still cannot control my eating. All I want is to go back to my weight I entered Junior year (end of sophomore summer) and be able to live the life of a normal person whose mind isn't always consumed by my weight.This is my second reddit account, my other account I use for actually surfing the site. With this in mind, I promise you I am not on here for karma or any alternative motives. I just want as many upvotes as possible so people can offer me advice. I want to enjoy my life without thinking all day about my weight because I will be in my comfortable and confident weight. I have been nervous about posting on here for a while and I would really appreciate any feedback
Not sure if this is the right place to put this.I've been recovered (for the most part; some minor setbacks) from my eating disorder (AN) for about three years. I'm happy with my body more often than not.I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and was put on Adderall, which really messes with my appetite. In order to stay healthy, I've been drinking Ensure. However, to me, Ensure tastes like inpatient treatment and is a big trigger. It just brings me to a bad place. Are there any alternatives in the world of nutritional beverages that I should know about?Edit: Please be sensitive to those in recovery and know that there are no "bad" foods. Many depend on Ensure in their recovery programs and for other health reasons.
Hello. I've struggled off and on with EDNOS for the last few years. Thing is, due to stress about school and finances, I've fallen back into severe restriction alternating with eating a more reasonable amount but overexercising to compensate. However, I'm into running and I'm at the high end of a healthy weight.I want to get help before I get lost in the obsession and suffer the physical ailments these habits brought me before. But if I tell the psychologists about the problem, then they might try to get me to maintain since I'm technically at a healthy weight, and that's what really scares me and keeps me from opening up about it. It's the reason I don't tell my parents, because I know they would want me to eat a lot during their weekly visits (they help me with chores and things I have trouble with).So - would they interfere with my weight loss goals, or just try to get me to achieve it in a healthier way? Because if the latter, then I would be much more amenable to it, as I know that this is just a maladaptive way of coping with my perfectionism and the constant anxiety from having to constantly confront my flaws whenever I make an error in college classes and that in the long run, the food obsession actually derails my goals even though in the short term it helps distract from my school anxiety so I can actually get myself to make any effort at all.
I probably wouldn't be concerned if it was just an isolated incident, but a friend of mine has told me she has struggled with bulimia in the past. I've also witnessed an occasion when she had a bit too much and started vomiting. She said vomiting was very easy for her and it made her feel good. Recently I was visiting her house and I had brought some candy that she liked. We smoked a bunch of weed and ate a lot of the candy, especially her. She was talking about how she ate sooo much. A little later she went into the bathroom and I obviously wasn't trying to listen, that's weird, but I heard what sounded like vomiting repeatedly. Then I heard the sound of brushing teeth. Then she came out and started cooking some more food. Am I just overreacting? I don't want to jump to conclusions but I'm worried about her. Is there anything I can do to help her?
Has any women here suffered of amenorrhea after an ED? I have suffered from anorexia and I am slowly recovering. I have lost my period about three years ago (I am in my twenties). Is a correct diet with a normal amount of calories sufficient to recover the period? How long does it take? Is it a risk for infertility?
Hi. I had an ED that started when I was around 12 and I guess I recovered around 14/15 (I'm not sure when the turning point was - I had lots of help from parents but never sought real counseling). I'm now 17 and dated two guys in the last year, both of whom I had difficulty eating in front of, often opting to skip meals so I didn't have to go through the stress. Obviously it's been a long time since I got better but this is still clearly a problem. Will I ever completely be free of anxiety eating around others? Any advice would really be appreciated, thanks.
I am an over weight woman in my 20s I have always been overweight. My binging and purging has been on and off for maybe over 6 months now. I had a period where I stopped about 3 or 4 months ago because I had a new job and stopped smoking marijuana so I had no time to eat and no appetite making me lose some weight. Now that my appetite is back and a robbery made me move back in with my parents there is a lot of food readily available. My mother isn't the best support system ANYTHING I pull out of the fridge weather I haven't eaten all day or its healthy she has what I think is a snide comment to make. But at the same time giving me what she hasn't finished at dinner telling me not to waste it. Any comment makes me want to purge right after I eat it. I'm ashamed to have anyone see me making me any kind of food. I only eat in my room. Eating out with friends is different, I'll eat a normal amount of food and just tell myself I'll work out latter. Home is the most dangerous for me I purge all the time at home I'm scared to gain a lot of weight here, I have before. I was losing but now my weight is at a stand still. My gag reflex has been getting weaker so I've been sticking my fingers farther down my throat. Today  I scratched my epiglottis and my fingers were covered in blood. It scared the hell out of me. I've just been drinking water and don't want to eat anything.NO ONE knows about my problem but I think I need to admit it has become a problem. I just don't know what to do now. How can I stop purging? How can I deal with my mother?
I'm 28/f and I've been bulimic for 15 years. I've gotten better in the past 2 years but I still purge, 3-4 times a week (which is a lot less than before). I'm ready for recovery now. My question is: what kind of after effects have people who suffered from long term BN experienced?

My girlfriend successfully recovered from bulimia. (praises all around) however, now when she is sick, she says her body will not puke. She has to do it herself, or she is miserable for days. also, she drools a lot, her saliva glands are way more active than they used to be. Are these side effects normal? should I expect any more? is there any way to help her with these problems?
My back story: I've always been a skinny kid and it's been the biggest problem during my whole years of growing up. I remember being teased a lot, bullied a lot, always feeling inferior and even having resentment for people. At one point I remember coming home crying because I felt like I was unnaturally skinny compared to everyone being "normal".  I'm 20 (male) right now at the moment. I'm not insanely mature or intelligent my any means, I'm just your average young adult.My environment : I'm pretty stress free compared to people my age. Apart from the common problems of thinking about my future and stopping myself from procrastinating I'm not much different. I'm looking for a job, hopefully I can land one and decide to keep it. The only issue is that I isolate myself very frequently which is probably my biggest problem. I'm very social and have loads of friends, I just tend to fade in and out of my social circle. I hang out a lot less with them than I would like to for reasons I'm about to discuss.My situation : Okay so right around the age of 18 my friends invited me to a gym. I wasn't crazy about it but I was excited to start seeing some muscle despite being insanely skinny. I was at the time feeling great about myself and everything. It was here were I felt like I had the best health. Then came the obsession.I felt so great from my beginner results that I looked online on how to capitalize on the fact that I have so much time. I started reading workout plans and nutrition. Eventually I looked into supplementation and everything. The problem is that I think I may have taken this too far. In fact, I don't know if I have which is why I'm here.Ever since then I became obsessed with not missing a meal. This became my priority over everything else. Above sleeping, above working out, above even my health, above hanging out with friends, above everything pretty much. If I can't finish a meal I will stay there for an hour if I have to until I finish it. I can recall spending two hours on one meal at one point.I have this obsession with caloric intake. I make sure to get the required calories to maintain my weight by any means necessary. Now I don't know if this came as a result of this but suddenly I started to develop a problem. I started feeling acid coming up from my food and eventually heartburn. It became so bad that I went to the doctor thinking I was having a heart attack. It turned out I have GERD which they gave me PPI's to calm it down. I've since stopped taking them and started taking something else that doesn't suck the energy out of me.I've consistently eaten anything and everything in an attempt to maintain my weight. I take so long to eat, I detest food, I eat the same thing over and over again. I'm like a robot. What's so hard for me is that I can't just be like everyone else who just eats and they maintain their weight. Like how the hell do you do that? If I do that I lose weight so fast it's not even funny. I have to count my calories to know that I'm reaching my goal every day.And well....: I'm currently thinking of giving up my goal of weighing in at  a higher weight.  I don't want any more or any less. What depresses me is that I don't think I can hold this weight that I'm at, much less that higher weight. I was just beginning to look decent. I mean I still look thin for my height. I'm just sick and tired of eating. I feel like I'm forcing myself day in, day out all because I'm trying to feel good about myself. I want to do this for me. It's the only thing I could do and now I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to go back to being skinny, I really don't. I feel terrible after eating every meal, I really don't enjoy food. To make matters worse, I occasionally have heartburn and yet I still try to force the food down. Sometimes I have breathing problems after eating as if I'm lacking oxygen and feel lightheaded. I'm doing all of this in the detriment of my own health. I want to be a higher weight so bad. I want to achieve my goal. I just don't want to hurt myself while doing it. I'm having trouble maintaining my current weight and I feel like just giving up. I know that as soon as I go back to my old intuitive eating habits I'll just become skinny again. I can go hours without eating and even then if my stomach growls I can hold the pain and decide to go to sleep like that. I would literally be hungry and be okay with not eating. This is how I am even today, just that instead I force myself to eat.I don't know what to do anymore.I'm currently eating a relatively high calorie diet and am a healthy weight for my height. But my body feels sluggish, breathless, tired, and fatigued. I'm mentally done.Should I keep my goal of gaining weight or just try to maintain what I have? Is my obsession with calories and weight an eating disorder? Is it okay to follow my old habits and just not eat?
I [19f] lost recently lost some weight by healthy eating and exercising regularly, and I really liked living this new lifestyle. However, now that I am back from visiting my Long Distance boyfriend for 7 weeks, I keep eating healthy but there are those eating attacks every day where I eat so much in a short time and it feels like I cant stop. Afterwards I feel so gross, guilty and embarrassed and usually I spit everything up again. Due to this eating attacks which happen more than once a day, I put some weight back on and I feel even more uncomfortable with myselfMy boyfriend says I have to control myself but how do I do that?
I've been dealing with disordered eating for about 2 years now. I started seeking professional help and it's been going well. I have a history of weighing myself multiple times during the day but have been making an effort to limit that to once a day and not dwell on the fluctuations in my weight so much. However, I'm going on a trip (long weekend) and I gave in and put it in my carry-on. It terrifies me to leave it behind and not know how much I weigh but it bothers me that my mood completely depends on what the scale says.I'm wondering if it is a better tactic to try to rid myself of the scale altogether? I just feel like I may not be making as much progress as I thought I was....a feeling that really struck me as the TSA people were going through my bag at security because of the scale. As they looked through my bag I felt ashamed and embarrassed that I'd lug this thing with me when I'm going to be back in 3 days anyway.Has anyone who has relied heavily on their scale in the past given it up for good? What was the process like for you? How did you deal with the anxieties when you go to weigh yourself and then realize you don't have it anymore?Thanks for any help.
So I just started dating a girl who was recently kicked out of a treatment center for her ED, and while most of the time she wants to recover and has long term goals and desires, she desperately struggles to even meet half of her meal plan and is losing weight again, even though she claims she does not want to. I believe her, because there is absolute fear regarding any food that is not on her list of safe foods, and she seems to be living off of Ensures and protein bars. I got her to go out for sushi on Monday and Sweet Green (a salad place) on Tuesday, and she finished both meals, but they also both ended in her being triggered and in tears. This girl is incredible and beautiful and I want to do everything I can to help her. She just met with her dietician who added calories to her meal plan cranking it up to what a regular healthy person eats in a day and I can barely think of how to meet that number if she weren't a vegetarian lactose intolerant person with a lot of food preferences. She is devastated but pledged to me she will meet at almost all of the calories her dietician planned tomorrow. I hope she does but I'm scared for her. I don't want to see her spiral and I wish she could see herself in my eyes. Are there any things I can be doing to help or things I should be avoiding? I've been trying to be body positive without focusing on weight and instead focusing on healthiness, as well as rewarding her every time she does eat and making sure she knows how happy it makes me. What else?
hello, my friend has been suffering from her ed (anorexia) for over 7 years. for the first time in a long time she is expressing interest in recovery. i would like to ask the members of this sub what the best ways for me to help her along her journey to recovery are, ways to encourage without over stepping bounds. if you have any links to resources as well that would be greatly appreciated
I am currently an active bulimic for 12 years now. I have been in and out of therapy, hospitals (mostly for depression), and on and off medication. I have had the desire to recover for years now but due to inadequate insurance, resources and a support system, I have failed to. I will be relocating to a new city here in a couple of days and after a random Google search, I came across an Eating Disorder Anonymous meeting in the area. I never knew there was even such a meeting. I was wondering if anyone has been to EDA and was curious as to what to expect? 
I've been in recovery from AN for a long time, and throughout recovery I looked to gaining strength as a means of coping with my weight gain. I've always been involved in fitness, even when I was overweight as a child and all throughout the bad past of eating issues. Throughout recovery I've gotten to take a much more lax approach, as I see it as just one aspect of my life, not the only one, and funnily enough I've seen the most progress in years (probably due to low stress and giving my body a break when I need it).However, my friend has recently gotten me into powerlifting, and I'm planning on competing in a meet this upcoming spring. I'm ridiculously worried, and I haven't even tried to think about what I'd compete at (weight classes) and I don't want to take an unhealthy approach. 99% likely I'll get advice of "don't do it"..but I'd like at least some input on it. My strength numbers are pretty decent that I wouldn't really care what class I enter in even though I might not be competitive.How do you all that are recovered keep a balanced mind set about fitness? Don't get me wrong, I have scheduled time in the gym on a structured program, but if I miss a day or need to cut something short, I just try to put it out of mind. I also no longer do any form of cardio that isn't fun to me (play sports with friends, go swimming, or take a nice walk instead of staring at a number on a treadmiill). How do I keep this balanced mindset?
I've recently started recovery for anorexia following the Minniemaud guidelines to the best of my ability. [Your Eatopia](http://www.youreatopia.com/) is where the bulk of the information is found so I won't get too deep into it if you're unfamiliar. So far, I've been experiencing unstoppable cravings or (as it's referred to on Your Eatopia) Extreme Hunger. Basically, where my question lies is that part of this method involves responding to any form of hunger, any time. That means physical hunger, mental hunger, cravings, boredom snacking, etc. The idea behind this (as far as I can tell) is that all of this food goes toward damage repair and weight gain and the urge 'binge' will fade as energy balance is reached.However, most resources outside of the Minniemaud community state that binge eating is unhealthy and will lead to further health problems, food addictions and obesity. I'm scared to continue letting myself eat on a whim if this is true, but if I try to stop myself during an eating session, I have little doubt that that will send me spiraling in a downward direction as far as recovery is concerned. Another issue is that it's incredibly triggering reading about people's "clean" and "binge-free" recoveriesDo you think there's merit to absolutely unrestricted recovery? Before committing myself completely to this, I want to know that I'm making a safe decision for myself and not putting myself through this uneducated.EDIT: Please no numbers around calories or weight when replying to this. 
Hi all,My girlfriend of over 2 years has recently started to become depressed and developed a lot of signs of an eating disorder.We used to live together but have had to live apart this last year. She has really struggled and has become quite depressed for various reasons. This has manifested itself as an eating disorder.A few months ago she thought she had put on weight, so she got quite down about it and said she wanted to lose some weight. I told her she didn't need to but she was insisting and as we don't live together I had no control over it.It has gotten to the point where she undereats every day. She is displaying a lot of signs of anorexia:  * Denying any hunger   * Obsessed with food (it's 80% of what she talks about)  * Constantly weighing herself - at least once a day, and panicing whenever the number goes up.  * Excessive exercise  * Negative self image * Refusal to eat certain foods she perceives as "unhealthy"   * Unhealthily low weight  * Removing herself from social situations where she will need to eat (e.g. going out for meals)The problem is that she won't accept that she has a problem, despite her family, work mates and I all telling her we are worried about her. She insists she is healthy, and any time we talk about it, it will become an argument.I'm worried because I want to help her but I can't until she accepts that she needs help. How can I get her to listen to the people around her and realise that she is ill?
If you are having problems with cycles of undereating and overeating, or having problems with overeating, or having problems with undereating, this article may help you start to resolve the problem. Eating disorders are psychological and somewhat physiological in origin. Let's just consider the physiology of undereating (restricting) and overeating (binging). * Hunger is not an issue of will power, it is regulated by over a dozen hunger hormones. Because there are so many of these hunger hormones, modern science has yet to come up with a simple solution, or a pill, for regulating hunger. We can, however, keep the hunger hormones in balance, as mentioned at the end of this post. * Regularly under-eating triggers **hunger hormones** that can stay elevated for **weeks or months** after under-eating, even after returning to a regular diet. [**JAMA article**](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1105816). This is why someone who under-eats has a relatively easy time of it for the first few days, weeks, and/or months. Over time, however, the hunger hormones can become impossible to ignore. It's not will power that's involved, it's hunger hormones. That's when restricting flips over to binging. * Regularly overeating triggers hunger hormones because the body starts to believe that a high calorie diet is necessary for survival. In particular, it seems to develop a resistance to leptin, the “I'm satisfied” hormone, [note here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin#Obesity). Leptin resistance can lead a person to feel hungry. * High glycemic foods when eaten alone can cause blood sugar levels to spike, then, when the blood sugar plummets, hunger ensues. Blood sugar levels are regulated by hormones including insulin and glucagon. Regulating high glycemic foods keeps these hunger hormones in check. [Mayo Clinic article](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/glycemic-index-diet/art-20048478). Some say [sugar addiction](http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/kick-your-sugar-addiction-in-9-steps) is real, [another article here](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/20/sugar-deadly-obesity-epidemic). * Stress and lack of sleep have a significant impact on our hunger hormones. [Stress hormone](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rebecca-fredericks/tips-on-coping-with-stress_b_5698913.html), and [Sleep hormones](http://guardianlv.com/2014/07/non-rem-sleep-why-even-dreamless-sleep-is-essential/). * Hunger does not arise with our thoughts. Hunger is driven by hormones, in other words, our hormones regulate our hunger. It is our hormones that send signals of hunger to the brain, and then the *thoughts* of hunger are recognized. This is why there are various kinds of hunger. An “*empty stomach*” hunger, a “*stress*” hunger, a “*weak and dizzy*” hunger, an “*I feel irritable*” hunger, an “*I can't think clearly*” hunger, an “*I'm tired*” hunger, etc. * Hunger hormones take time to become imbalanced, and take even longer (weeks and months) to be restored to balance. The body is wired to survive and messing with our diet is taken as a serious threat by the body's hormonal system to the survival of the body. * There is a relatively easy way to keep hunger hormones in check: eat three balanced meals a day, two to three snacks a day, get plenty of sleep, moderate exercise (perhaps 30 minutes of walking 3-4 days a week). This might mean eating by the clock if need be, and lying down by the clock (even if not sleeping, just resting), and moderate exercise on a schedule. * Eating disorders often arise from psychological issues and many people say they got help for their ED with therapy. Therapists are there to help us learn to deal with difficult emotions including depression, stress, anxiety, grief, etc.  Help your body as much as you can by eating regularly and healthfully, and help your mind, too. Seek professional help if you struggle with an Eating Disorder. ---Some notes on some (there are many more) of the hunger hormones ghrelin, leptin, insulin,  cortisol, and thyroid hormones.**Ghrelin**Ghrelin is a hormone released mainly by your stomach and pancreas.  Ghrelin sends out hunger signals when your stomach is empty, and lowers that hunger signal when your stomach is full. When you miss meals, or purge, ghrelin levels increase and make you want to eat more. This is why eating small and frequent meals is a very effective part of a healthy eating plan—food in the  belly helps keep your ghrelin levels steady, and therefore keeps you from getting too hungry.**Leptin**Leptin is responsible for reducing the appetite and increasing the metabolic rate. It is a hormone which is produced by the fat cells, circulated in the bloodstream and then sent to the brain. This process tells the brain that the body’s energy thermostat is set right, it says "I'm satisfied." When people undereat, or purge, over the course of hours and days, their leptin levels start decreasing, and when leptin decreases, appetite increases. Also, when people overeat regularly, it seems to decrease lepin's message of "I'm satisfied." By eating regularly (such as 3 meals, 2-3 snacks) and with appropriate portions (not overeating nor undereating) this hormone returns to balance. It takes time.**Insulin**Insulin is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas. Insulin is produced when we eat,  and it allows the sugar in our bloodstream to enter into and nourish our cells. It is like a key for energy to enter our muscles, organs, nerves, the brain, etc. However, if we eat high glycemic foods, insulin levels get very high very quickly to deal with all the excess blood sugar. One way it deals with the excess blood sugar is to store the excess sugar as fat. After this sugar high, the insulin levels plummet, thereby sending the message of hunger throughout the body and brain!The way to prevent this from happening is to not eat high glycemic foods by themselves, but rather, eat them along with lower glycemic foods in a meal. Articles on high glycemic foods: [High Glycemic foods Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycemic_index) and [another article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/27/low-glycemic-foods-diet_n_1630893.html).**Cortisol**Cortisol is “the stress hormone” and is produced by the adrenal glands. Some of its main functions include increasing blood sugar levels, as well as to aid in fat, protein and carbohydrate metabolism. Cortisol is released due to normal levels of stress, however, excess stress produces excess cortisol, and this results in some physiological changes including increased desire for sweets as well as weakening of the immune system. Sleep helps restore cortisol levels to appropriate lower levels. If you have a lot of stress in your life, try to get lots of rest and sleep, and learn stress management techniques.**Thyroid Hormones**If your thyroid gland is not functioning one possible problem is that you will have lower levels of the thyroid hormones T4/T3. These hormones regulate your metabolic rate and a lack of them means the metabolic rate slows down. This is turn means fewer calories are required and lethargy, weight gain, and undernourishment can result. Thyroid hormones interact with ghrelin and other chemicals that tell us when we are full. So if your thyroid hormones are inadequate, your ghrelin levels will be out of balance and you will want to eat more. In addition, thyroid hormones are important for leptin levels, because when T4/T3 is present in insufficient levels the effectiveness of leptin is reduced, again, increasing your appetite. Your medical professional can run tests to see if your thyroid hormones are functioning properly.edit: word correction, added some info
I used to be anorexic, but around the new year, i made a resolution to finally begin recovery.. but with passing time, I started to overeat, big time. I really don't know why, maybe my body just craved all this food it was deprived of. But I completely lost control. I have to stuff myself even though my stomach hurts so much I cannot even move. It is like I eat nothing at all, or EVERYTHING. Since January, I have gained weight and am at a healthy weight, i am still gaining and i am really afraid how this will continue. My mother started to comment on my weight and i feel like shit. I want to stop without relapsing but I don't know how, it is really embarrassing, especial compared how I used to have perfect self control around food..How can I stop the binge eating?
Okay this is pretty embarassing but I'll try to explain it as best as I can.Since freshman year of college (I'm a junior now), I've gained a bit of weight. But starting this summer, I've been having a real problem with my eating. I've been eating too much in one sitting, ordering more than I can eat, and eating at night more often. Just last night I got in trouble because I ate half of a sub that was meant for my sister after work. I couldn't help myself. I'm not entirely sure if this is some kind of disorder or part of my depression, but I'm concerned for my health. I don't know who to turn to Reddit, I need help.Is this the start of an eating disorder? How do I stop binging?
A long distance friend of mine (we are both under 18) recently revealed that she has some sort of eating disorder, but I don't know what I can do about it.Basically before high school, she was probably underweight, and people made fun of her for this. So to stop it she decided to gain weight by eating more, however stopped when she learned her family had a history of obesity. So now while she is afraid of being obese or malnourished, she is anxious about eating itself. * She says she does not feel hungry, or if she does she has suppressed it somehow.  * She is too anxious to eat alone, so she only eats with other people around, and then she is constantly worried that she is eating too much, too little, too fast, too slow, and so on.  * She says eating feels something like a panic attack.  * She undereats. * She doesn't really trust her parents, and to be honest I don't really blame her. I'd agree that's probably the way to go, but knowing her and her relationship with her parents I really don't see it happening. I've tried to convince her to tell her parents other, unrelated things before, it didn't go very well. * She doesn't trust her doctor either, and again, neither do I, because she ignores her apparently, and she is also has a bit of a phobia of prescription drugs because she had a very bad experience with them once. If there are any other adults in her life, I don't know of them. I'm very concerned about her, and I don't know what to do. She says I am the first person she has ever told. She says she was a little afraid to tell me, and she says there is no need to be concerned because she is fine, she says. Nevertheless I still worry about her. It would be difficult to find therapy, which I think would be best, as we are both under 18, and there is not a single living soul other than me that she trusts with this.What can I do to help her?
My girlfriend recently went off to college and before she left she was doing alright. Being there has made her ED way worse in the way that she stopped taking her medication, she stopped seeing her dietitian, and she won't go to therapy. Can anyone suggest what I can do? I just need someone to talk to. She's all I have.
I am looking for advice about my girlfriend.We are in our mid-twenties, have been together for almost three years, currently live together and generally plan to be together for the long-term.My girlfriend has a long history of EDNOS but had her first episode with AN about two years ago. For that episode, she started restricting in August. I started noticing that something was wrong and started asking about it in September, she admitted something was wrong in November and at the beginning of December she agreed to go live with her family to recover. She spent the next two months living with her parents, going to therapy and following a mealplan. When she returned home she was at a healthier weight. She started seeing a therapist in our city. She was very fragile about the subject though and we fought about it often so we made an agreement that she would see a therapist and I would give her space about the food issue and not bring it up at home.This system worked well in that we were able to return to our regular relationship which is built on many other things besides her eating disorder. I would sometimes ask how things were going, but I wasn't trying to monitor her.Then last December she quit therapy because they had "run out of things to talk about". She didn't tell me this happened and I didn't ask because of our not talking about the eating disorder system. In April, I said something that triggered her (I have my own not always healthy relationship with food, but not an ED). I knew that something was wrong after that, but I felt guilty and hypocritical and avoided talking to her about it. I didn't know that she wasn't seeing a therapist at the time, and I thought that the best thing I could do was to get my own eating back on track and let her monitor herself.I got things on track by the beginning of June so I felt ready at that point to start asking her about her eating and trying to help her get back on track. She denied (with plenty of yelling) that anything was wrong until the beginning of August when she told me all that she had been restricting since April at her old levels. Interestingly, since the beginning of August, we've had quite a candid dialogue about her eating disorder which has been really healthy (the dialogue, not the eating disorder).Now it is the end of August. She's at a scary weight, her mom is back in town (I called her), my girlfriend (under a lot of pressure) has gone to the doctor for tests. Her mom is pressuring her to move back in with them to recover. However, my girlfriend really doesn't want to take a leave from her job to do this. She also doesn't want to go to inpatient or outpatient.So she told us that she is going to start eating again on her own. She said that she can only do this if she doesn't have to think or talk about food and her weight for awhile. She wants to pretend that things are normal and use that to get back to a healthy weight.I think this might work for her. She's stubborn so when she's motivated she often achieves her goals. However, I'm really uncomfortable with this proposal. I realize that it is her body and her health, but as someone in a long-term relationship with her, I feel like it is my business too.I have many assumptions about the situation. Given her age and her repeated experiences, I suspect that this is not just a phase that she is going to grow out of. I think that she's going to have to do therapy to get to a more robust recovery. It also really scares me to go back to a no talking policy especially if she is not seeing a therapist. I really don't want a repeat of last time.The number one priority at the moment is to get her weight to a healthier level. Right now when I tell her that her proposed plan doesn't make sense to me, she gets really upset, feels invalidated, then yells and/or stops talking to me.I don't want to jeopardize this part of her recovery, but I'm also scared that if she gets to a healthier weight using this method, then we will be back where we started. We will have reset the precedent of avoiding talking about the issue which I don't think is healthy for our relationship or her. Also, once her weight is at a healthier lever, I worry that she won't be motivated to go to therapy and work on this from a deeper level.I want to be with her for the long-haul, but that desire is conditional on having a healthy relationship (which is the case with us except for eating-disorder related issues). Her mom is still in town and I'm scared to be left alone with this when she leaves. I don't want to go through this again and make the same mistakes again.You all have given great advice and reflections in the past. Thanks for whatever help you have.TLDR; Girlfriend has a recurring eating disorder. She wants to recover on her own. I am scared that this is only a short-term solution that will lead to problems later, but don't want to jeopardize healthy progress.EDIT from OP: A few edits for the message I just sent to you all:-Her old therapist is no longer working here so she can't go back to her. Also, her insurance situation is precarious at the moment which is part of why it will be difficult for her to start seeing a new therapist (though I think this is largely an excuse).-I'm a girl (I don't think that really matters for this situation, but it always seems strange on this subreddit when people assume I'm a guy).
Hello, I am currently in therapy and currently using EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) to help me work through and process traumatic events which led to my development of bulimia. Tonight this process is not working to overcome the urge to binge, and I would like to know if anyone had tactics they use for when they need to overcome such an urge. Obviously, I am looking for healthy tactics, and this is not a way for me to avoid eating entirely.
I am due to return to University for my second year and this time I am thinking about reaching out to the counseling services that are available. During my first year my binge eating episodes that I've had for years escalated into bulimia and I really struggled but I struggled on my own. Since returning home for the summer I have managed to reduce my purging but my binging has not subsided. I fear I will fall back into old patterns once I return.I realise each University is different in what services they provide but I was just wondering how / whether this kind of thing helped anyone? Did seeking counseling effect everyday life at Uni? etc. Thank you.
My close friend has had an eating disorder since 8th grade and has recently relapsed. She recently graduated from a top university and has had a rough couple of months since. She is working out/running when she is not supposed to (by doctor's orders) and has lost more weight.My other friend and I are very concerned about her well-being. I emailed the head of a local support group to see if it was running so my friend could come. I've also read things on the NEDA website (and this subreddit) that helped me see that this is an illness she has that has hills and valleys. My other friend is taking her illness personally and is getting frustrated at the situation.What more can I do for my friend? I don't want to police her since she is a 22 year old woman but at the same time, I feel like I'm not doing enough.
Hello all, I have been in therapy for bulimia since January 2013. I haven't been using behaviors to control my weight in about 3-4 months(no dieting, no purging, over exercising) My weight has increased to the highest it has even been. I am having a hard time with that. (I am still proud of myself for not binging, purging, and running myself sick.) Now a month ago, I got Mirena. I think I have gained even more weight. I want to go into my obgyn and discuss it, but I have never felt listened to. I have just shrugged off his wierdness because hey, I saw him once a year and had no issues usually. But now, I need to discuss something very personal. Its not just weight gain when you have an eating disorder.FYI- I dont own a scale and I never look when I am at the doctor. I am triggered easily by the sight alone.I dont know what to do. I see my therapist in two weeks and I will discuss it there, but I need some support. I am utterly obsessing over my arms, stomach, and legs. I don't want to give in to purging.Thanks for reading, any encouragement or advice is welcomed.
I have been gaining weight for approximately two months on my own after having what I believe may be a variant of anorexia. I am now approaching my "goal" and would like some advice for how to transition my diet from gaining to maintaining, as this is an area that causes me a huge amount of anxiety. I am afraid that I will not be able to stop the gaining when I am ready and start maintaining.I understand it may take a little adjusting and tweaking, but I would like some tips so that I can start to prepare myself. Thanks!
So, I'm going to avoid triggers as much as possible. I am almost 20, diagnosed BN, been in recovery for two years. I was hospitalised at age 17 due to low blood pressure from BN, when it was very bad. Bedridden for a few weeks. I am terrified I'm relapsing again. I need some help or advice from those who have gone through this part of the recovery because right now I have no support system. I can't get any therapy or such at the moment due to visa issues (moved to a different country), but I'm having it really bad right now. I have been repeating patterns from the middle stage before it got really bad last time. I thought I knew my triggers, but now I've developed new ones. I don't think I should mention them unless somebody asks specifically because I don't want to trigger anyone else. I don't want to relapse dear god. Anyone please talk me through this? Can I do something to overcome the new triggers? Or alternatively, has anyone else gone through this part here? I just need some advice or to hear someone else who gets it.
I have been a picky eater my whole life, and have always been slender/average sized. The foods I will/won't eat shift in and out of my life in phases. For example, for months I will eat the same thing every day for breakfast, then one day become suddenly tired of it and (usually) skip breakfast until I find another breakfast I enjoy. For a few years I was a Pescatarian, but began eating more meats when I went away to college and found myself craving protein more.While in my first year of college, I dealt with an extreme decrease in appetite (could have been related to a decreased use of marijuana) which affected me for weeks. I lost weight rapidly; the smell of food made me nauseous. Textures began to affect me, often resulting in gagging, before I would eventually give up and abandon the meal entirely. During this time, I would often smoke marijuana at night and binge eat, resulting in odd sleeping patterns/insomnia. I went to numerous doctors for fear of some infection or illness, only to be dismissed as an eating disorder. When I returned home from my first year of college, it became apparent to me that my body was not not processing lactose as it used to. Though I have not had this confirmed by a doctor, I feel it's pretty obvious now (symptoms of head ache, nausea, upset stomach, diarrhea, etc upon consuming milk/cheese/dairy). In the recent few years since, I have found that my appetite has only decreased. Often times, I feel hungry, almost starving! yet with absolutely no desire to eat. Food seems the utmost in unappealing. Even my "favorite" foods do not appeal to me. I often wonder why I feel this way towards foods, and wish I could just inject nutrients straight into my body to avoid tasting/chewing/eating. Because of these feelings, I will procrastinate eating beyond beyond my threshold, and often break down in tears of exasperation at my own lack of desire to eat. Most times, after reaching this threshold, I force food into my stomach (Sometimes I just flat out don't eat.) Many times, after this point, I will begin to crave protein (meat! cheeseburgers, specifically) but will often throw up when I ultimately try to consume the food. I also have issues with the speed I eat at; I eat faster than most of the people I eat with. I used to think that eating quicker would mean I could ultimately fit more in my stomach, but I know this probably is not true. However, I still find myself subconsciously devouring things at the speed of light (potentially part of the reason I throw up after eating sometimes.)I know this is long and I'm not even sure if anyone will take the time to read all of this, but please let me know if you/someone you know experiences issues like this.... I don't know if what's wrong with me and I'm not sure how to get help. I'm afraid to tell any of my friends (or anyone, really) because I don't think they'd understand. What's wrong with me?!?!? Do I have an eating disorder?!?!?!?
I discovered, on her visit to us, that my niece is bulimic. I'll skip the details, but I am sure of it.She is distant, geographically, and her visit was so we could connect a bit more.Her parents haven't said anything about it to me, though they may know based on a comment my brother (the other uncle) made about her father trying to bulk up her smoothies.Is there anything I can do to help her? Would broaching the topic with my sister (her mother) help? Should I just stay out of it?I guess my question is, for those who have struggled with this: If you had an uncle you saw once a year, is there anything he could have done to help you?I doubt there is a great answer to this question, but I have to ask it. My heart breaks.
I'd like to start by saying that I created a throw away account because I'm embarrassed of admitting this, even if it's to people on the internet that will probably never see me in person. I have been battling with my weight my whole life.I'm not overweight, but I hate my body. Recently I started a diet and lost weight and it was wonderful. But I think that my eating disorder developed because I have so many restrictions. I eat as little as possible. I work out and when I eat something I consider unhealthy I take a laxative. Lately I started eating healthier so id stop with the laxative. But tonight I fucked up. I ate so much I hate myself. I used the laxative yet I still feel fat. I was doing so well staying away from carbs and the laxative. I was doing well until tonight. And I can't stay away from it for more than a week. Because I go back to binge eating and the laxative. That fucking laxative that was the reason I had a miscarriage. I want help. I need help I just can't tell my family or bf. They're proud of me because I work out and try hard to not gain weight. And I do I just eat secretly and take laxatives secretly. How can I stop binging and using laxatives?
Hello.I've been getting considerably better over the course of the last year - almost completely cutting out the binge purging, only very occasionally relapsing after particularly stressful days, and this has pretty much stopped at this point. Recently my boyfriend has come back from a year away, I've started a new, quite high energy cleaning job, and my eating has changed considerably. His coming back has made me feel so much better about myself, and thus I'm not obsessively counting calories and weighing myself daily anymore. Unfortunately we've also been baking a lot and eating together (he eats a lot of junk food). I've been trying to eat reasonably healthily but this, coupled with me being absolutey starving after work, has caused me to binge on snack food a lot more despite eating healthy meals.Since he's come back I've gained a little bit of weight which still has me on the low end of a healthy weight, but I feel horrible. I'm very aware of my thighs and tummy and it's causing negative thoughts and a strong desire to starve myself and over exercise again. Any advice on what to do would be appreciated. On one hand, I'd really like to eat healthily again, exercise once a day etc. but I'm worried this focus on weight loss this early on in recovery will cause a bigger relapse. On the other, I really don't know how long I can stand this feeling of being fatter. I can't imagine it's made too much of a difference physically but I have quite a small frame and it's making me depressed and unhappy with increasing regularity. How can I feel happy with gaining weight?Thank you x
Hello fellow recoverees. I struggled with anorexia from the age of ten years old, after being sexually abused by a family friend, until seventeen years old. After that, I finally started recovery and here I am almost three years later. My parents don't believe in mental health issues (or treatment) and they saw my issues as something "demonic". They tried to "help" me by being critical perfectionists, and telling me how embarrassing/disgusting I was/looked. That was oh so very helpful, obviously, and exactly why it took me so long to start my recovery process, which I had to do all alone. Basically, I had a supportive boyfriend, but other than that...I fought through the worst hell I've ever been through, on my own. And the reason I come to you, is because I don't feel like I ever really worked through anything. I basically just forced myself to eat...and eventually it got easier. But I went through all the swollen stomach/swollen extremities/swollen temptations without help and I honestly wish I didn't. I didn't even have any medical supervision during my refeeding, so I have no clue if my body is really fully recovered or not. I look healthy, but my soul is so very tangled up, I barely know how to cope. For as long as I can remember, I was using control over food to cope, it's all I knew. Recovering on my own took that away, and left me with nothing to replace my feelings/rebuild myself with. I can't exactly go get treatment even now, because I still live with my parents and they still control my medical bills. I have an injury and I can only work two nights a week. I'm getting married in December and with the stress of planning, fear of change, and the anxiety of first time sex (we decided to wait for our wedding night), I'm really really starting to struggle with my thoughts. I mean I'm literally starting to fall apart and I'm walking around just trying to hold myself together. What the hell do I do? How do I deal with difficulties without resorting to disordered behaviors?

I'm a 23-year-old male who has struggled with various iterations of anorexia and bulimia for nearly ten years. Recently, I've become aware that I've done some serious damage to my teeth, which has now progressed to what I would call mild to moderate periodontal disease.I'm horrified at what I've done to myself, and really want to fix it as much as possible. I know that this will involve cosmetic dentistry and possibly oral surgery, but I have several concerns about this.First, I have no idea how I'll afford this. I do have dental insurance, but I doubt it would cover cosmetic or elective procedures, and I am not in a financial position to finance this myself. *Does anyone have experience with or knowledge surrounding submitting similar claims to insurance?*Second, I am not recovered. Far from it, and I am doing continual damage to my teeth at present. It would be pointless to invest in repairing my teeth at this point since I would likely just ruin the repairs all over again. *Any tips or advice for how to approach recovery after so many years of the ed being an (the, really) integral part of my life?*And third, I'm terrified of discussing this with a doctor or dentist. I know that the first step in getting dental repairs will be discussing the situation with a dentist, but I just don't know if I'll be able to do it. I've talked to therapists before as a teenager at my parents behest, but I've never taken the initiative myself to make a doctor or dentist aware of my illness. I'm afraid that they'll be dismissive or something, particularly given that I'm male, and I don't think I'd find the courage to pursue it again if that were to happen. *Can anyone recommend strategies or resources to help me in doing this?*Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read and respond - it is greatly appreciated!
I [32/f] am average weight,  and have had always tried to have a healthy diet. Lately, basically after I moved in with my boyfriend, I have found myself binge eating. Like getting fast food and junk food and eating them like crazy, with little regard for the outcome. I usually track my calories using my fitness pal, but when I do binges like this I am too ashamed to put in the calories. I've bought smaller servings and things like that, but I still find myself wanting to binge. I've never really done this before and I suspect it stems from my feeling constricted on what I can eat while at home with my dude. Not sure how to handle but I am scared of the unhealthy habits I'm cultivating. How can I stop this before it's a serious problem? Any advice would be very much appreciated!!
Hi! So my SO and I have been together for over two years; we're quite serious and he's been a tremendous support for me. The worst stages of my disordered behaviour predate our relationship, but I've relapsed occasionally since we've been together. He's the only person i've flat-out told about my history and the one who encouraged me to seek counseling. I'm close to his family, but his dad will not infrequently make jokes about bulimia. Example: today after a big family dinner he joked about purging and mimed vomiting, turning to me and asking,"What do you call the girls that also take the stuff to go out the other end? The not-only vomiting ones?"He's honestly a really wonderful man and a good father, but he's pretty conservative and has no idea that his statements can be pretty stressful for me to deal with. Any suggestions on how my SO or I can influence his behaviour without revealing my history?
My mother says I may have anorexia but I feel as though I eat an above average amount of food. I don't think I'm underweight even though I've lost a lot, I just thought my metabolism sped up. So all I'm wondering is if its possible I don't see the amount I eat the same way as my mother does, and if it's possible that I have a problem.
I was wondering if this community has any suggestions for podcasts that focus on eating disorders and recovery? I have searched the iTunes store as well as google and am not getting much. Thank you so much in advance!
A long distance friend of mine recently revealed that she has some sort of eating disorder, but I don't know what I can do about it.Basically before high school, she was skinny as a twig, and people made fun of her for this. So to stop it she decided to gain weight by eating more, however stopped when she learned her family had a history of obesity. So now while she is afraid of being obese or malnourished, she is anxious about eating itself.She says she does not feel hungry, or if she does she has suppressed it somehow. She is too anxious to eat alone, so she only eats with other people around, and then she is constantly worried that she is eating too much, too little, too fast, too slow, and so on. She says it feels something like a panic attack. Though she does snack occasionally, sometimes she goes days without a full meal.I'm very concerned about her, and I don't know what to do. She says I am the first person she has ever told. I've told her that I think she should see a therapist of some sort but we both know that would be difficult since we are under 18. Any help would be appreciated.
I want to preface this saying my writing style may not be the best. My apologies on that.Hey all. My girlfriend has been in treatment for several things all this year. Depression, Anxiety, and Anorexia. She's been where she is now for a month, and she's made some progress. She no longer has a PICC line, she's drinking and trying different foods, and told me they were yummy. All of those things have made me happy, the last more than anything.But she's also had trouble adjusting to the place. She's a stubborn lady, likes doing stuff her way, and being told what to do, and when to do it, is something she really hates. I understand it's most likely necessary for this, and I think she understands that too, but that doesn't make her like it any more.Tonight we were texting, and she told me she really wanted some McDonalds, but that she would purge it. I told her I believed in her, and that she wouldn't. She said that hasn't worked yet. So I told her to just give it time, and she said maybe. I asked her why she doesn't believe in it, but and she responded that she don't see anything changing. I pointed out the things that had, She said that its taking forever. I explained that it just takes time.She asked how long she has been there, and I told her a month. She said "Slow progression then I will just go right back at it again" I told her that any progression is good, and that when she's better we'll work to keep her from relapsing into it again, and that we will keep it from happening again.She answered me back "What if I don't want to? I'm tired of trying." I told her "I know it's hard, but you can't give up" She responded that she wants to. I told her that's not an option, and that there's all kinds of things she wants to do in the future. Do it for them.After this, she told me she was falling asleep (which happens quiet often that time of night with the meds she's taking, and plus she'd had a long day) and that we'd talk about it tomorrow.---She's losing motivation, and I don't know what to do. She needs to get better. She's made good steps. But I don't want everything to go start regressing, or worse. Does anyone have any advice?
I am a 28 yo woman who has recovered from severely disordered eating. I am a healthy weight now. I look normal and my body is probably healthy (I am having reproductive health checked at the moment but fingers crossed). But there are things I still do: track every calorie on myfitnesspal; feel extreme guilt whenever I eat enough; buy food and compulsively eat in secret; resort to diets/restricted eating plans whenever stressed; refuse to eat in certain circumstances (esp when I am around people against whom I bear a grudge); feel ugly and fat and crave a sense of weightlessness, crave signs of being low weight etc. The thought of not tracking food, not weighing myself, and not at least trying to lose weight (I usually don't manage because I still operate on much less extreme starve/overeat cycles) scares me shitless. I can't not track.I struggled from age 12 to 23 with cycles of binge eating and starving myself. I was in therapy for five years to treat my crippling depression, and during my (wonderful) therapy my most disordered eating behaviours went away. However a lot of it never actually came into my therapy - for example my binge eating, which I simply adapted to stop me putting on weight - I would buy food, chew it and spit it all out - continued and was often triggered by intense therapy sessions but I never actually discussed the behaviour with my therapist or anyone. I have still never discussed that behaviour. I think what put a stop to the worst of it actually was that I got a new, sane and grown up boyfriend and I didn't want to be secretly doing things that were 'abnormal' in the side of our relationship so I pulled in my disordered eating to a socially acceptable levels: as described above, nothing I do is overtly abnormal. I constantly 'diet' and watch what I'm eating, I skip lunch at work. So do lots of women. Normal enough to go unnoticed.I want to talk to my boyfriend, who I now live with and am looking to start a family with. I want to get past my obsession with food. I want to tell him that it's probably not great when I sit there tapping away on my food tracking app or refuse to partake in carbs, until I do, and am all over them for hours. I'm just not sure how to go about either having that conversation or making a more complete recovery. I am reading the sidebar resources etc but I would really love advice from anyone. I feel like I wasted the brilliant opportunity I had to explore this while I was in therapy, and like the non-severity of my disordered eating now means I could be in limbo forever, enslaved to my calorie tracking apps and feelings of shame around food.Does anyone have any advice for me?
He is 15 years old and used to be slightly fat (I can't be precise because I didn't know him well at this time), and because of this, other boys used to make fun of him . About six months ago he started doing a lot of exercise what made him to get fit. He also did a calorie count which was pretty ok. He lose a lot of weight but everything seems healthy so not red warning was on.But, from about 1 month ago his food habits went down to dust and quickly was sent to the doctor. He was diagnosed with AN. It's impossible to talk with him about what its healthy. He even argues with the doctor that (a modest amount of) calories were extremely high for a boy like him. We have found records of him eating (an extremely small number of calories) per day.He has been prescribed therapy in October, but we don't know how to handle this until them.Any help you could give us will be eternally thanked.
I relapsed today, after being clean for 2~ months. I was having a bad day, and threw up my breakfast. Well today my food didn't come up, but a lot of bile and small amounts blood came out. I don't know if if teared anything, but I'm really scared.Around 2 months ago my dad told me to stop and has supported me, and helped me overcome it. I relapsed and I broke our promise. I'm really scared to tell him and it's only a about a tear amount of blood. It's not a lot, so I don't think I should tell him. I'm really scared though.We don't have the best relationship, and he yelled at me today. :(I don't want to seem like I just want attention. I'm really scared. Please help. What should I do?
I'm going to try to keep this short and to the point as per the subreddit's rules.My SO has a significant ED that she relapsed upon a year into our relationship. She restricts, binges & purges, self-harms, overexercises, and punishes herself if she misses an exercise emotionally and physically with many of those other behaviors if she misses a workout or "eats too much". It's very cyclical as one bad behavior prompts others and so on so forth. I'm sure those on this subreddit are familiar with the types of behaviors I'm speaking of, so I won't go into any more detail.Year two was very difficult for both of us and an education for me in the world of EDs. Physically and as a person, ED took over all aspects of her life - and affected most of mine. Again, not going to go into details, but my personal and professional life have been greatly altered as a result in a negative way.But don't ever think for a moment that I do not love her and am not trying my best to be supportive. By that I mean I do not judge, recognize that ED is the problem and not my SO, take every opportunity to acknowledge my SO's strengths and ability, and occasionally give in to some of ED's lesser demands as a stepping stone to recovery.At the close of year two, my SO checked herself into a 5 week outpatient facility. She had finally reached the point in which she was ready to accept that she had a problem and needed help. I was extremely proud of her and was by her side throughout it.She wasn't 100% compliant with the tasks put forth on her by the facility, but she stayed strong and show remarkable improvement. After completion, she agreed to continue to see both a nutritionist and a counselor.Sadly, my SO began drifting from the "plan" shortly after treatment. She ceased meal-planning and started restricting. One of her objections was that while in treatment they provided her with processed food and she felt it was toxic and would take months to purge from her body. We tried to compromise: No bread for a month, but then she had to allow herself to reintroduce it into her diet. I guess I should have known that such conditions were never going to stick. Because not only was bread not brought back into her diet, but all grains became outlawed. As were a great many other things.My SO lives in a rather posh part of the city that has many wealthy and young college students. She is still rather young, but post-college and in the greatest shape of her life thanks to her time in treatment. Yet, ED cannot help but look at all the younger girls that surround her on the streets and tell her that she's fat, ugly, and disgusting. She honestly sees something in them that is supermodel worthy and she's herself as horribly out of shape when in reality, many times these "others" are just as or less than in shape as her. My SO cannot have a conversation in the same room as a mirror or other reflective surface without staring at it and judging herself - the conversation becomes background noise to her.In the past few months, she has relapsed hard. We've returned to a state wherein almost every conversation eventually gets turned around into something related to ED - even things like movies, the weather, or the news.Seemingly out the blue, yet not feeling entirely unnatural, this weekend she broke up with me. She explained that while we've been together for two and a half years, she's been together with ED for 16 and she cannot live without ED but she can live without me.Sadly, this is not the first time she's stated something similar, but this time it felt more real than ever before. And this time, I told her that I love her and would do anything for her, but I wasn't going to fight her if this is what she truly wanted.In the days that followed, she and ED went on a bender for lack of a better word. She eat nothing and pushed herself physically to the point of pain. That's what I know by her word, but I suspect she may have done even worse to herself in the realm of self-harm during this time.We've spoken a bit and even met for a while earlier this week. She asked me what do I want. I could tell that she regretted the whole situation and wanted to just return to the status quo. As much as it pained me to say it, I said we should continue to take a break for a bit because I was too emotionally raw to make a solid decision.I love her so much and want to be with her, but I don't know that I have the strength to continue to deal with ED as the third wheel. It's heartbreaking to watch someone you love and admire treat themselves like crap by a party you have zero control to combat.Right now, my SO and I are in communication at least once a day. I lend her support and she does me. You have to understand, even though we are technically broken up, we're still best friends and want to be there for one another. We weren't driven apart because of one of us cheating on the other, or lack of love, or incompatibility.This "limbo" state we're in cannot last forever. Eventually, we're going to have to commit to being separate or together. But I cannot figure out what is best.Earlier today, she called me to share that she's trying to meal plan again. It's still under significant restrictions, but this was obviously an attempt to let me know that she's trying. I appreciate that and I told her how proud I was of her, but couldn't bring myself to say, "That's great! Let's just laugh and forget the past week ever took place!"A part of me what to run back to her for putting forth the effort, but another part of me is scared that we'll just be in this same place several months down the line.I'm also scared about what ED will do to her if I'm not around as an SO and support person.Frankly, I don't know what to do.Look, I'm not looking for an answer from anyone. I just would appreciate insight from those who have been there as someone struggling with ED, formerly struggling, or SOs of those with ED.Thank you for your support.

I have been in one serious relationship all my life, and that ended very badly almost a year ago, but since I am still in high school, I have been forced to see my ex almost every day. I was getting much better at managing my ed over the summer, but now that I am back at school, every time I see my ex I feel overwhelmed and have an intense urge to binge & purge. It doesn't help that he suddenly decided to join all my extra-curriculars over the summer, so all the things I used to enjoy are no longer enjoyable because I am too upset that he is there. Obviously I have some major unresolved issues regarding that relationship, but my real question is how can I keep myself from succumbing to these bn urges because they are really hindering me from making progress towards recovery?
My amazing goddaughter has an ED that is escalating. She is working with a friend to possibly go inpatient for treatment of Anorexia with Bulimic tenancies. She is keeping me to the outside and not telling me she may be going into impatient this Sunday. Eventually, she will have to tell me as she stays at my house and we talk every day. Here's my question. When/if she tells me, what do I say? I need answers from people who have had to tell loved ones they need help or going into treatment. I love her so much, I am proud of her for getting help even if it's not with my involvement. PLEASE! I know how difficult it is on people with ED's and I don't want to say the wrong thing. I want her to know I love her now and when she comes back, but don't want her to feel that I think she needs it or whatever. Please help me. I need her to go get help knowing without a doubt that I am here now and will be there when she's done with no judgement. What would you have wanted to hear when you told your family, boyfriend, girlfriend? I am begging here, she's all I have.
I'm a 32 year old female and I can't even force myself to eat anymore.Last year I unexpectedly broke up with my girlfriend, she just sort of vanished one day. I was a real mess and couldn't eat or sleep, and lost a lot of weight really quickly. My doctor diagnosed me with an eating disorder and referred me to a clinic as an outpatient, but I had no motivation and going made me miserable so I stopped. I really thought I'd got through the worst of it and started putting weight on after about 12 months. I felt like I was better. And then recently I don't know what has happened. I seem to have slipped back into it. I realised a couple of days ago that although my stomach is grumbling I have no desire to eat anything. I can't force myself to eat more than a few bites and when I do eat something my stomach aches afterwards. All I've eaten I'm the last few days is the odd slice of toast and I have drank a lot of tea.I used to love food, and cooking used to be one of my favourite things to do. I've always naturally been a healthy weight for my height and have never been bothered by having a few extra pounds or really had to watch what i eat. I've stopped going out because I feel too thin and don't want anyone to notice and I can't talk to my friends. I don't know what to help and anxiety about it seems to make me worse.Does anyone have any advice on what I can do or what help I can ask my doctor for?
I have severe anxiety that effectively makes me have a panic attack whenever I eat something that's not one of my comfort foods. I am severely malnourished and it's starting to give me muscle pains and cramps, I'm genuinely worried about my health. I'm underweight and my diet is poor.I'd like to start including more foods, ideally vegetables, but whenever I eat a "non safe" food I feel as if I'm having an allergic reaction (I have no knows allergies).I'm at a loss as to how to begin approaching this. I began looking for some local support groups, and I see a therapist, but I don't feel powerful enough to take that first step. Does anyone have suggestions to offer?
I've found many articles online for eating disorders as a result of PTSD, or comorbid eating disorders and PTSD, but can't find anything about PTSD as a *result* of eating disorders. I'd like to know, can eating disorders cause PTSD? Traumatic events during the eating disorder perpetuating the trauma into life years after "recovery," making complete recovery difficult? If anyone has any insight or personal experience on the subject, I'd like to know. Many thanks!
I have struggled with BN for 16 years, having had recovery periods, and relapses. While I realize everyone's recovery is unique, I have found the following things to be extremely helpful. Relapses are AVOIDABLE1) Portioning out food into ziploc bags. EVERYTHING. Carbs, fruits and veggies, nuts. And ALWAYS carrying "safe" foods with me, in these portioned bags.2) Eating as if food were medication at certain times of day. YOU MUST eat x in order to fuel your body. Eating more than this (at my trigger times) is akin to an overdose. It WILL cause me bodily harm (trigger a behavior)3) Sharing my finances/bank login with someone supportive (and obviously someone that can be trusted!).4) Filling up my gas tank at the beginning of the week and then NOT carrying any debit/credit cards with me.5) If I am going out to eat, reviewing the menu in advance and choosing my meal beforehand.6) Avoid being alone during traditional trigger times. Make a daily date during that time, with a person or an activity.7) Sharing a list of currently "unsafe" foods with someone supportive. Sharing the information with someone is psychologically helpful to me, even if there is not necessarily an action on their part.8) Being honest with myself about my "unsafe" foods. There are foods that I would LIKE to be safe foods, but are not quite there for me. With these foods, I may need help with moderation, and I should not consume them without a safety net (having a person with me who is aware that this is a potential trigger).9) Documenting behavior on a calendar that is public to my support. Even if it not verbally discussed on a daily basis, the idea that they are aware of my progress is encouraging. Also, even when I am doing poorly, I don't feel so isolated.
I went back to treatment earlier this year and my insurance cut out before I finished the course my team outlined (this is the second time this has happened. I can't pay out of pocket.). Immediately after leaving, I started to relapse, because I was really dependent on the support I was getting.It's been a few months and I am really deep into my eating disorder again. I want to recover, I really do. But I don't know what to do on my own. I see a therapist twice a week, but he doesn't specialize in ED and I can't afford to see someone else too.I've tried free support groups, but all the ones in my area are full of people who are strongly in recovery.Any suggestions for what I can do?edit: Please notify the OP, /u/penxpaper217, when you reply here.
I am a little over a year into recovery after a relatively short, but severe, stint of anorexia.I am completely and utterly overjoyed at dealing with recovery, even with it's difficulties and how long it's taking - it is totally worth it. HOWEVER, I am now at a point where i am trying to normalise my eating.I haven't under eaten in a long time. I over eat a lot. Not that it is a bad thing. My method of recovery was totally giving into my intense hunger so over eating to restore weight and normal metabolic function was great but now I just want to eat to hunger signals again.I am finding this hard. Every few weeks I will just go out of control and spend a weekend, a week, two weeks just absolutely eating until I feel physically unwell (but I no longer purge, hooray!). It's not that i want to feel obsessively in control of my eating but rather I don't want to feel a slave to my food!It's not a reaction to under eating because I have had much experience with binge restrict cycles and thus know that this is not the case anymore.My question is if anyone else went through this in their recovery and how they overcame it or if it petered out by itself?Thanks in advance!
I've been suffering from SED since my 4th or 5th birthday - my eating habits were normal (at least that's what I've been told), until I got very sick from salmonella poisoning. Ever since I've been restricting my diet to a small number of certain food items (lots of white carbs, sugar).Trying to eat anything else makes me physically gag, heave and vomit. It's very rough.I just turned 27 and I need help... I don't want to spend the rest of my life overweight, avoiding social contacts in fear of anything that has to do with food. Where do I start? How can I get help? Who can I talk to? I'm lost and I need your help, please.
I think I'm developing bulimia. Binging multiple times a day, purging even more.Anyway, I really want to break the cycle. I know I can't do it myself. But I'm also really scared to seek help. I've told one person, though when I vent to them it's like talking to a brick wall. It helps, I guess, even a little. I don't want to go to those clinic things where you're secluded and away from everyone else. I have so many passions (multiple instruments, art, my horse, etc.) and I don't want to leave that behind. I don't know how to go about telling my parents either, at least without breaking down crying. What happens when you decide to get help? What is recovery like?
I've restored and relapsed a handful of times in the past two years. I'm no longer in a dangerous place, but I'm not where my treatment team wants me to be. I know, at this point, this is my decision, but I'm scared. I agreed to start weight restoration this week. Any thoughts or ideas for getting through this?
I'm pretty healthy most of the time, I exercise and work out daily, and eat healthy pretty much every day.But occasionally I will eat until I am physically sick, and then some more. My appearance means a lot to me and during these binges and the next day, I hate myself. I will often try to purge myself during these binges, though even if I succeed I will just eat more food to fill myself up again.It is getting to the point where binging is a daily thought for me and its messing with my head. I have even started to begin to purge myself unconsciously after eating healthy meals.No one knows I do this even though it has been happening for a year now, and I'm afraid of what peoples reactions will be.Can anyone provide some insight on steps I should take to stop this? Please, it is ruining my life.
Hey guys.  I don't really know how to start this off so I guess I'll just jump into it.I lost quite a bit of weight over the past year through calorie counting. I went from slightly overweight to now being underweight by BMI standards.  During this time my attitude towards my weight and eating has pretty drastically changed.I absolutely will not eat anything that I can't track (calories).  Even the thought scares me.  On the very few occasions I've broken this rule I have chewed up food and immediately spit it out so that I won't take in any extra calories (gross I know :/).  I usually feel extremely guilty after this and will add a few calories to my amount eaten for that day "just in case."My friends and family have noticed how thin I am and try to get me to eat more.  They frequently offer me food and even shove things in my face sometimes and try to get me to eat them.  The last time this happened I burst into tears and begged them not to make me eat the food.  I was horribly anxious for the rest of the day and couldn't eat again until I had taken a xanax.My doctor has noticed that I'm now underweight and expressed concerns the last time I saw him.  I lied and said I had no appetite, so he prescribed me an appetite stimulant.  I took it once and it worked, but I absolutely hated feeling out of control of my food intake, so I haven't taken it again.  He called me a few days later to check up on me and I lied to him about taking the medication.I'm terrified of the thought of my body changing.  I eat the number of calories that should keep my weight exactly where it is.  I weigh myself daily and panic when the number changes in either direction.  I dont want to gain weight, but I don't want to lose weight either.  I want my body to stay exactly how it is right now (even though I'm not happy with it).Can this even be considered an eating disorder?  Should I seek help for this?  I'm eating a proper number of calories and I'm not trying to lose any more weight, but I feel like my relationship with food is fucked up.  I wish I could just relax and go back to enjoying food.  I wish I didn't care this much :( any help/advice is extremely appreciated. 
Hey all. First time posting on this forum, and I need your advice.I have a very dear friend who, last year, moved 1000 miles away with her boyfriend so he could attend graduate school. She has lost a lot of weight, and while it is possible she did so in a totally healthy way, it also seems kind of improbable and I'm worried.Friend is female, about 5'8" and when she moved a year ago, average weight but now she is very proudly underweight. She told me during high school she battled with bulimia, and with such dramatic weight loss, it's concerning. She says she lost the weight through running. As far as I know, she runs 3-4 times per week, and recently participated in a 5k.Professionally, she's a chef, loves cooking, and she often talks to me about the yummy-sounding meals she makes for herself in her downtime. They don't seem low-cal, but they're also not super unhealthy. I love her very much, and I don't want something bad to happen to her because no one asked her if she's engaging in her ED again. In HS she went to see a therapist and things got a lot better, but I know unchecked, she will basically do whatever she wants. Her bf is a majorly clueless, and I don't think I would ever bring anything up. I myself have struggled with eating disorders in high school and early college, and I have told her so. I also told her, last time we saw each other (about 5 mo ago) that if she was being unhealthy, she should tell me and I would never judge her. She insisted she was being healthy, but since I've struggled with an ED, I also know it's very common to lie to protect your ED. At the time, I really relished my ED, and would have never told anyone in case that would lead to me having to give it up. Anyway, what do I do? Ask again? Leave her alone? I value her autonomy, but I really don't want her to get hurt because everyone just ignored her. Any suggestions are welcome. 
I've been really depressed recently. Too the point where I don't feel like eating. Part of it is kind of self harm but another part of it is that food just doesn't interest me anymore. I don't really have an appetite. I eat in situations when I have to, but otherwise I can't really say I enjoy eating. I'm a 17 year old male. Any advice or thoughts?
So last July I hardcore relapsed and my ED completely took over like it never had before. I was in IP for a week and then left voluntarily. When I left, I was doing great--I became friends with food again, nothing was off limits, I gained the weight back, and felt happy.Lately, though, I'm noticing the foods I find safe are getting smaller and smaller. I have a hard time eating enough because my meals are getting more restrictive, but I AM eating enough. I don't think I've lost any weight.I just don't know what to think about myself right now. Most days I feel alright, though today I feel really depressed. I still have zero confidence in myself and can only challenge my anxiety and low-self esteem with the assistance of my boyfriend. Most days I just feel neutral. I can't tell if I've really made much progress or not. The triggers just have become less frequent, but when they do come I don't always do so well dealing with them.I don't really know what the point of this was. I just feel vulnerable. Does it sound like I'm in a place where my ED could take over if I'm not careful? I feel so confused about myself right now. Can anyone suggest what I should do?
Came in here hopefully to find some answers and find out what I should or should not do. My good friend's wife has a eating disorder and is bulimic. It's nothing new. Everyone knows it. She went to treatment before. The thing is, that we (all friends) don't think she is doing well now. There are plenty of times where some of us would "catch" her alone in a restaurant, without her husband. Every time we go out, she would go to the bathroom after eating. Now, I was going to talk to my buddy about it and just tell him that I really care, and I see what I see and I worry. Well, that didn't go good. He told her about the text and she got mad at me. I was told to mind my own fucking business, that I have issues too and should worry about them and not about other people's issues, yada yada yada. Not sure what that was about. I just agreed and said, ok, fair enough, but I just want you to know that I care. That was that. She passed out once, then ended up in a hospital twice in past few months because of her "potassium being low". I feel like my buddy enables her. She knows she is purging in the bathroom after we eat! Yet, nothing is said. Nothing! It's like it's out of sight out of mind! How do I approach this? Should I just keep my mouth shut? I am becoming a bad guy here.. and all I do is care and try to help!!!
I have been a bulimic for over 7 years now since I was in High school. It started after my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and got worse after family issues and my father passing away after my mom.I have been struggling to reduce my binges and purges but not much has worked. I have noticed my hair is getting thinner every time I look at myself. I used to have thick hair and now my scalp shows. This is stressing me out and I fear that I will lose all of my hair, with other health complications in the near future. Right now I am on vacation and I purge everyday, at least twice. I don't know what to do at this point, I can't even look at myself in the mirror without looking at my hair... I really want to quit but there is nobody who can stop me when I am about to binge. Any advice would be helpful, I don't want to get any worse. Thank you.
I'm not very informed in the topic of ED, so I apologize in advance if I come across as a little ignorant.I'm considerably underweight for my height, and it is visible. Several people have suggested that I might be anorexic, and the reason I've always denied this is that I've always known anorexia to be an eating disorder where the person suffering from anorexia refuses to eat due to an unrealistic perception about their weight and body.However, I'm very much aware that I'm underweight. I know I need to eat more, and I have never ever starved myself to lose weight or because I wasn't satisfied with the way my body looked. The reason I do not eat is simply that it does not feel good. I just don't like the feeling of food going down my throat. Just like doing laundry, washing dishes, or getting homework done, eating feels like a chore to me, and I'm always finding ways to procrastinate. On good days, I'll force myself (albeit painfully) to eat a three course meal. On bad days when I'm stressed about other things and don't want to deal with the chore of eating, I'll go 24 hours with very little.Does this sound like an eating disorder, and is there some merit to what my friends have been suggesting? Most people I know love eating, and I've never been able to empathize with that.
I have always had a sordid relationship with food, starting from when I was a youngster. My parents would always make me clean the plate and I was always a little husky because of this.About 3 years ago I got fed up with it, I went from lost weight to a healthy weight in about a year. I joined the military got in shape, but then I got out and I quickly put weight back on.I am overweight now and what I am really wanting to ask is this. Is being hungry constantly an eating disorder? Even after I have just had a meal less than an hour later I will feel like I am starving. Snacking doesn't help but for a few moments. The only way I won't be hungry is if I stuff my face and seriously over eat.
I have recently entered inpatient treatment for AN. I entered at an very low weight and have a lot to gain. It's only been two weeks so far but the physical effects of weight gain are already beginning to show and really bother me. How can I better accept the weight gain?I was just wondering if anyone has any tips / tricks to help deal with the hair loss, skin coming back to health (feels like I have a sun burn constantly!), and night sweats that accompany the recovery process? Is there anything I can do to slow the hair loss because it's falling out in clumps!?
I am currently seeing some one who has disclosed to me that she has suffered from anorexia. I'm not sure whether or not she is actually lying to me when she said she has "recovered".Anyway, she has told me that when she was hospitalized with anorexia she had bone density at the level of an 83 year old woman (She's 20) and that she took calclium tablets to attempt to correct that. From my understanding, bone loss is irreversible. Is it? She also seems to have a lot of social anxiety and seems to have  deep lows in mood. Other than that, she seems to still have a fascination with hospitals in general...she has low blood pressure too...and insomnia. I'm wondering, can you still have this AFTER recovery or is it a sign that she is still not eating?I'm very concerned. For those of you who are ex-anorexics, what problems have not ebbed since you established a normal weight? Please let me know. Thank you all.
I am in bulimia recovery, and my doctor has recommended that I join Overeaters Anonymous and acquire a sponsor. None of the support groups in my area have specific foci, and I am concerned that I will be the only person in my group with a bulimic/ED experience. Will I be unwelcome as someone in ED recovery/someone with a healthy BMI?I noticed on the Overeaters Anonymous website that there is one weekly Skype meeting with a focus on anorexia/bulimia. Does anyone have experience with this particular group or online OA meetings in general?
About two years ago now, I was hospitalized a slew of times due to mental issues. The only lingering fear I had was gaining weight while I was hospitalized and due to inactivity. And I did, due to my being inactive and eating a surplus of calories due to my own boredom and unhappiness at being in mental jail. I was put in a position where I was essentially forced to gain weight, where I had no control. Now that I gained the weight, I have trouble thinking about anything other than that. I never really had major issues with anything before I gained the weight, at least my problems didn't seem that bad, and I once did have a good opinion of myself. Now, I feel like my body image issues have plagued me and kept me from focusing on anything other than hating myself. I know that I will never be happy until I lose the weight, because I don't value anything else in life beyond superficial things, because I wasn't praised when I was younger. I don't have any behaviors of restricting or binge eating or anything, in fact I used to never think of food(weight) as often as I do now. It's getting so bad that I think sometimes I'd rather not be on this earth. How do I value other things in life if I have no happiness in my life anyway?
Briefly, I suffered from binge eating disorder when I was younger. Found weightlifting/bodybuilding which really helped reduce the problem. Started using drugs and that became my new obsession, and became a heroin addict. I went to rehab, quit heroin, got back into weightlifting. Got out of rehab, and now I wake up in the middle of the night and overeat. Ifeel like I want to die the next day.I STOPPED DOING HEROIN, BUT CAN'T STOP THIS NOCTURNAL EATING DISORDER. I need help...how did anyone else conquer this?
Hello brothers and sisters!I used to have BED and was severely obese, so one day a few years back I've decided to change my life and started strictly dieting, after achieving my goals, I noticed that I cannot balance my eating, its either I BINGE or I do an extreme diet (even more extreme than the diet I've used while losing weight).Please help me overcome this, I want to eat like a normal human being, once I eat something that is not part of my strict diet, my mind shuts off and binges, every time I attempt to maintain my weight and balance my calorie deficit, I immediately screw it up.Does anyone have any suggestions on how to overcome this?Thank you.
I have recently stopped restricting heavily and am now eating a low-normal amount of calories for my size per day. The problem that I am having is that I obsess about every meal and then feel extremely guilty after eating it. I have been doing regular exercise every day in the hopes that it would make me feel less guilty. This helps me feel okay for the first meal that I eat, but I always end up feeling depressed and guilty after eating dinner. If anyone has any ideas on how to minimize guilt after eating during recovery, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you..

I haven't fallen on bad habits for three years. Last night I was heading to a party and my dad pats my stomach and says "you're getting fat again, you need to start going to the gym". Tears instantly filled my eyes and it took everything in me not to cry. I've been in tears all day, it really got to me. I still struggle with thoughts about my weight, my body image and relapsing thoughts. I just needed to vent to people who understand how words like that, even though it wasn't really much, can push you over the edge.How has your family treated you since recovery? How have you dealt with any insensitive/invasive/rude comments?
Title says it. I've found the vomit around the edges of the toilets around the house. She makes comments about how she's fat, etc.Just now, I walked into the bathroom and the toilet was distinctively vomit-splashed. I told her to clean it up and she acted very defensive and irrationally upset had it been just a regular (albeit messy) bathroom visit... she acted exactly like I did when I got caught.I've been bulimic for four years. I don't want her to walk the same road. I can't talk to our mother because when I was in the early stages myself she acted like some savior and really just ended up forcing me to hide it better.Please help me help my sister. What can I do?
I've been overweight for 10 years, and finally started taking care of it this summer by counting calories and undereating. It's working. I'm rapidly approaching ideal weight.While I'm happy the weight is dropping, I believe I've developed an eating disorder, and that's worrying me.Relationship to food - A few weeks ago I needed "cheat days" where I overate to stay sane. Now, I can barely bring myself to just undereat safely. Every meal is forced down and makes me feel bad. Yesterday I ate less than advisable, so I tried eating normal today and to my worry, I couldn't. I managed to eat enough to be at just a significant caloric deficit, and I feel like shit. I'm sick to my stomach. I have decided to eat some nourishing food now to bring me closer to a normal intake, but just thinking about it is revolting.Self image - My bathroom weight shows a significant weight loss.  When I look at myself in the mirror I see no difference. To myself, I look at least as overweight as I was a few months ago. And believe me, I have looked hard and tried to see the weight loss everyone else seems to notice. I just can't.I'm still not below healthy weight so I'm not in any immediate danger, but things are accelerating out of control, and I'm worried. I'm hoping that if I'm catching this early, it will be easier to deal with. I don't feel like encumbering any health care system yet, as I hope I can just deal with it myself first. So I don't know... Any advice?
My counselors goals are for me to be confident with my body and never diet or exercise with the goal of improving body. I don't understand why I can't achieve a healthy muscular (think female crossfit) look and not be considered recovered because I'm changing my body. Why do non-ED people get to and I don't? My counselor says that they should but it's not the norm and it's not fair that I have to be the good example. Is this what recovery means? 
 I'm bulimic. I have not vomit in 6 months but I'm fighting with it. I have not seen an specialist. Is it the only symptom? I have long periods of fasting and short of convulsive eating.
My sister went to some sort of "facility" where she was supposed to receive help but I am worried they actually made things worse. Since leaving the facility she has completely cut off all contact with our family.Her husband says he is not allowed to say what is happening. She comes from a very loving family and has never had any conflicts with us. Is this a common problem? Is this a recovery technique I am not aware of?
I'm basically self diagnosed and have never seen a professional about about this. What are the benefits of going and what is there to talk about aside from feeling the urge to throw up after every meal?
So I just discharged from treatment on Thursday. I was in a residential for a month, PHP for four months, and IOP for two months. I have made so much progress with my behaviors (restricting, self harm, binging, and purging) over this time and feel so proud of my recent discharge, however after working with my great treatment team and AMAZING therapist for the last seven months I'm really struggle with feelings of abandonment and depression. It's really affecting me and in the days since behaviors have been very frequent. I'm just wondering how others have made the transition from a higher level of care to a strictly out patient team? I will be seeing a therapist (who I know and ADORE) twice a week and a dietitian twice a month beginning in about two weeks, but I really don't want these next weeks to be a huge step backwards. 
When I was anorexic, I usually slept from about 6.5-7 hours a night. I never felt super tired on this schedule and I successfully managed to go to school and work and do well at both (this was in high school). When I started recovery I slept pretty much ALL the time which seemed weird since I was finally fueling my body and I thought I'd need less sleep, but whatever -- I went with it. I'm now fully weight restored, don't actively engage in any behaviors, and eat well and regularly throughout the day, but I still sleep way more than I ever did before I was sick or during. Not quite as much as during immediate recovery and weight restoration, but still a lot (I can't function on less than 9 hours really). Has anyone else experienced this? Does it go away eventually? Is there anything I can do to function on a little less? It's really hard to work full time, plus hour plus commute each way, when I really need at least 9 and preferably 10 hours of sleep!
I'm looking for self help books that are available for free online for eating disorders? Books published in the last 10 years, please.If anyone has any links or recommendations it would be greatly appreciated!
