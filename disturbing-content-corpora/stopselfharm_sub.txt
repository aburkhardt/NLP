It's been years and I want to keep them scars but it's getting so hard. I've had so much stress lately and I've stopped eating and sleeping which is bad enough.I want to make just a few cuts, just because I know how numb it makes me, I'll stop being needy and bothering everyone with my problems.I miss having a place on my body to point to and say "This is why I hurt, I'm in pain and here's why." It's so much easier than the anxiety and despair I'm feeling.I don't feel validated. I don't feel loved. I feel like a huge burden and my attempts to ask for help haven't worked.I just need somebody to listen. I need somebody to understand and know that I'm struggling and need love and support. 
I made it 30 days.. today I'm 30 days self harm free, and I felt pretty good about it. Then one comment, one fucking horrible comment from a keyboard warrior and I'm a crying mess. It would be so easy for those 30 days to disappear. Do people not think? Or do they just not care? My biggest insecurities were used against me, and I feel like the pieces that I'd started to put back together have been shattered all over again.
The scars on my forearm are around 7 years old now, and I look at them every day. The more recent ones on my thighs aren't bad because I can cover them from myself most of the day, but the forearm ones I look at every day. I've tried to draw over them because they are a big trigger for me, but I'm sick of doing it. Anybody else do this? I've thought about getting a tattoo, but idk what I would get and I'm worried I'll get sick of it.
Seriously. I can think that I want to get better, but the craving is always there just waiting until I give in. People who have stayed clean for years, what is your secret?
Like I just want to do small cuts, so I won't get caught/need stitches. I'm due for weight loss surgery either this month or next, and I'm excited. But I feel so anxious about it and I just need some relief.I'm kind of holding off on the deeper cuts until after surgery to insure that nothing holds me back from getting it, like a hospitalization for cutting might. I'm doing the rubber band thing at the moment. It's ok. Not satisfying but I try to focus on the sting for as long as possible to make it feel closer to cutting.Also thinking about burning with ice/salt. Just feel crappy overall. I really want to grab a blade and just do light cuts on places no one will see. 

Cause there's nothing else for me to do. :-)
Hey Reddit. My friend, C, does catering which obviously involved cooking on a stove. She's confessed to me that her sudden mood swings and depressive episodes are due to her feeling the constant urge to burn herself on the stoves. C does it for two hours three times a week. She doesn't want to tell the teachers - any advice? Thank you.
So, i will stat out by saying i am certain this thread already exists. However, i have tried several of the typical methods for not cutting (rubber bands, ice, Etc) and gotten no where. I am currently in trauma based therapy, where we are focusing on non-cutting alternatives (such as Take 5 and other things). Although, over the past few days it hasn't done a lot. I am constantly getting triggered, from an event that happened last week, and i just know cutting would make me feel better. I do shots everyday, and the small pin prick is so satisfying. I know if i didn't throw away my blade i would have cut by now. I promised my boyfriend i wouldn't and i stand by that. So, the main thing i want to know is what methods have you used for non damaging self harm, if that makes sense. I want to kick this habit, after cutting weekly for nearly two and a half years. thanks in advance.TL;DR Looking for some more non damaging self harm methods, since the rubber bands and other ones i have tried as advised by a therapist don't work as well as they used too. 
I'll admit I cut a few minutes ago, first time in about a year though so I'm not beating myself up (lol) over it. But it made me realise, for the past few days I've been feeling down and nothing fixed it, and I tried everything I could. Immediately after that first cut it was like I had just bloodlet my emotions away, and about twenty minutes later I'm still quite elated, clear-minded, and productive.This isn't meant to tempt people, that's pretty much the only good thing about self-harm. The scars suck, the days of having to hide your arms/legs suck, the judgment sucks. But those few minutes sure seem worth it every once in a while.
I've been hiding how much I struggle for close to five years now, and lately(the past 24 months) things have gotten much worse. I can't afford a doctor visit, or any medication, so I never told anybody about my depression, or what happens when I can't cope. The other day my best friend told me I could talk to them about anything though. I froze up, and didn't say much, but I've been thinking about asking them if I can still talk to them about what happened to me, and what I've been doing to myself since, but I don't know how to start without making it seem like I need immediate hospitilization.Any advice on talking to somebody about something so serious? I've been trying to find somebody to talk to for five years, and don't want to ruin my only opportunity to get help.
Probably not a good idea to have a pack of blades in my cupboard.I feel like a teenager over and over again. I'm 27. I wish I was normal.
I added cutting to my self harming routine about a month and a half ago after a surprise break up and found it fairly therapeutic, but I failed to see that the scars would have any lasting effect at the time. I guess I figured they would fade when they healed and would be gone in a couple of weeks. But now that the worst of these scars have healed, there is a significant purple outline of what I did, and I'm so scared it won't go away.The thing is, I could handle normal scratches compared to this, they would be much easier to brush aside in a social scenario. But I carved my ex's name into my leg. I don't quite know exactly why it felt like the right thing to do, I feel insane for it. But the fact of the matter is, I can't wear shorts any more, and I'm afraid I can never be with another girl again. Not that I particularly want to right now, but I want to know that I have the option, or ability to feel desirable. And right now, with another girl's name scarred onto my leg, I know that's not possible.Is there anything at all that I can do to cover it up or speed up the disappearing process? Even just temporary solutions for a few hours at a time, anything to help hide what it really is around others. I hate looking down and seeing her name staring back at me, and I simply cannot have my legs out around anyone any more, and it's so frustrating.
Has anyone here gone to a treatment center that you would recommend?My 14 you daughter keeps relapsing back to cutting and lately her suicidal threats have become more focused. She is also threatening to run away. She has had psychological testing and sees a therapist every week, but doesnot open up at all. She needs help and she is even willing to go to a treatment center, but I am so scared to send her to one that will be abusive. 
For most of us the holidays bring about untold amounts of stress and our families are often right in the center of that. I just returned from our annual Thanksgiving trek down to my sister in law’s house and I decided that enough is enough. Just because it’s been our tradition for the past five years does not mean I have to put myself through unnecessary stress and uncomfortable situations. This year I put my foot down and next year I will not be returning. I also happened to read a story in my redbook magazine about a woman who did the same with her family and spent Christmas with just her husband and daughter doing xmas their way and how much better she felt when she wasn’t bombarded with all that constant tension and worry. I used to look forward to making the drive down and seeing the family. Looked forward to the day after snowboarding trip and then watching the civil war game on tv. But the past four years have not been fun. My sister in law has a drinking problem, last year when I brought this up everyone just kind of shrugged their shoulders and said oh well it’s her. But this year it was out of hand and worse. I talked to my father in law about it and he plans on discussing it with her. Her temper tantrums have gotten way out of control. A grown woman should not be yelling and throwing things around because she is upset and didn’t get her way. I refuse to expose my daughter to that kind of behavior and situation. I look forward to planning my own special Thanksgiving celebration next year. One filled with love, comfort and warmth. Just remember, you can’t chose your family but you can chose how you spend your time. It’s not always an easy decision but once made I think you’ll be surprised at how much better you feel. 
In November 27 it's gonna be 2 years since the last time I've cut. The only reason I haven't fucked up this week was because I couldn't simply screw up almost 2 years free... it means a lot to me, but it's not easy. I'm bipolar and this year everything is out of control, even my eating disorder is unstable at the time. I'm being really strong but I can't take much more of it, I feel like something bad is gonna happen soon, maybe is just anxiety talking but what if it's not? 
I've been going through a rough patch the last 2 months... And the urges came back, of course. The thing is that I haven't hurt myself after really fucking myself up with deep cuts on june (I was close to get stitches on one, luckily I took good care of it and it healed well), when I told myself 'this is enough, I should stop'. And I did. But before that I had already told myself I would stop, and that was in november, last year. So I failed I guess, more than once actually.So I think I'm too old for this everytime I have the desire to cut. I think I've already let go the part of me that wants me to harm myself... I mean after being months clean you can give yourself a little credit and let your guard down to enjoy what you've achieved, can't you? Just stop being alert 24/7, and let your mind be without no worries, is that too much to ask?BUT NO. I got real scared the last time caused I cut too deep, like never before... And now I'm thinking about it again... constantly thinking I need to cut just to let go some of these shit I have on me... some of these afwul fellings that have been only growing non stop. I can't handle it anymore, I need my sweet release... While half of my brain is screaming at me not to do it. But I just can't think of something else, I HAVE TO DO IT just to calm myself and put my mind at ease.I've been cutting on and off since I was 13 (I'm 21 now) and it seems like I would never will be able to finally let this issue go. It's shit, I'm shit, and I'm deeply sorry to everyone who can relate to this. Fuck I wanna cut myself so bad :(
Hi,Wife cut last night, only told me now, 14 or so hours after. One cut was pretty deep didn't bleed much. She's asking if she should get stitches. I know she doesn't like doc or hospital. What do I advise?
everything is perfect in my life. i have a boyfriend since almost 10years, a have a stable, no-stressful job. i have enough money to get what i need and what i want. i could talk to my best friend everytime i wanted to, but i don't...first time i started self harming was when i was 14 years old. i remember being really angry because i wasn't allowed to go to a concert with a classmate and their parents. there were many times when scratching or little cuts was a relief from anger and hate. but somehow i stop.but now - almost 10 years later - it's more than just some scratches. they are cuts. i started again by just banging stuff against me, but now i do small cuts for nothing. i have no anger, i'm not sad, i'm not bored. i just don't want to stop. but i know i should ...
Just give me a reason. My brain can't come up with anything and I desperately want a reason to not hurt myself. Talk me down. 
It's been just over a month since I last cut, but this past week has been so brutal and I have no idea why, I'm writing this with a razor blade next to me about to cut.  I just wish I could be a "normal" teenager.
I'll start this by saying I'm relocating, and once I've settled in I'm going to the doctors for referrals, Meds, or any help I can push for. But it's the short term I need some help with.Background - started when I was 11, never really sought help, became chronic over the years. Until recently I hadn't even thought about it for 21 months, had a small relapse then gave in. Now I'm cutting again. What I want advice with is what helps you take your mind away from the urges? My old techniques aren't working anymore. I used to use escapism (TV shows, gaming etc) but now the urges are so strong it's like someone takes over me to do it. It actually physically hurts if I don't give in. I've only felt like this once before when I was trying to quit young. I can't remember how i got through it. Couple of days ago I relapsed hard and frankly lost count of how many times I did it, but my shoulder is a mess. I don't know how long it'll be until I get a doctors appointment when I'm registered, so I'm desperate to try anything to take my mind off it. I used to cling to one dream of being heavily tattooed, but right now I just don't care. I have a "just don't tattoo this area right now" mindset.I appreciate any advice in comments or in inbox, and thanks in advance for anyone that replies
Someone please talk to me, please be my friend.Please?
Wow, I've been saying "ten years" for two years now. This feels very.. strange, accepting it's been twelve years.I've learned how to get away with it, I've perfected the art of hiding it. It sickens me that I have, but I have. It's been about a month.My girlfriend has been helping a LOT, and for once I've actually given her all of my razors. Typically with my exes when they catch me I give them "all" my razors, but have a few I keep as an anxiety relief. But she's the first person I've ever met that I **don't** want to lie to about it. I've never had a problem lying to my ex's in the past because it was more of a priority to me, and my last relationship was eight years long and my partner was letting me do it.Thus lies my problem.. I've been doing it for twelve years, and even before that I have been scratching and clawing at my skin for as long as I could remember. I just didn't pick up a razor until I was 12.  Since then, I've done any form; cutting, burning, scratching, bruising, drugs, anything that can hurt me, will.  I guess that's also why I never gave up all my razors, it seemed pointless to me because as much as it disgusts me to admit, when I want to do it, nothing will stop me. I've broken pens and used the metal from the pens to hurt me. I've gotten safety pins hot with lighters and burned myself. I scratch myself. Anything, it doesn't matter, as long as I can do it.I've got extreme anxiety (in case that didn't explain it with what I just wrote lol) and it's highly tied into my cutting. Anytime my anxiety levels spike, even just a little bit, I want to do it. Bad.I can say though, weed has saved my life. If I can calm myself down enough in that moment to go smoke a bowl, within ten or fifteen minutes, I've calmed down enough to actually forget that I wanted to do it.Now, I refuse to smoke at work... Which is an extremely stressful job. So that kind of sucks.I'm not really sure where I wanted to go with this post... I don't know how to stop, or if I can even say I've officially "stopped", but it was a pretty sad moment for me realizing it's been twelve years and I still can't stop this shit...Anyways, if anyone takes anything from this post: Look into getting a medical card to help with cutting. Because it's probably the only reason why after twelve years of this I'm still here.

I've already tried meetup.com multiple times over the years. from knitting groups, to cosplay groups, to lgbt groups, to creative groups to writing groups. Each resulted in people eventually stop responding to me. I'd maybe hang out with someone once outside of the group if I was lucky then I'd stop getting responses from them. They drift away. I haven't heard from any of my meetup people I had met in months.i was a regular at the get togethers. even neighbors that I had met over the years in the different neighborhoods I've lived in didn't want to hang out with me. I asked. I'd see them in passing and ocassionally talk to them outside. I'd ask if they wanna get coffee sometimes but they'd always say no or they were too busy. My disability is called bronchopulmonary dysplasia. It's chronic and I've had it all of my life. I have 27% lung function. I get tired easily. Coughing and wheezing is something that occurs daily. 
I'm so ashamed of myself. Everything started to hurt badly and I didn't know what to do...I just wanted the pain to go away... but I fucked up...and broke the promise that I would never cut again to my best friend. I just want to be happy. I don't know anymore....
I went to the counseling center today for the first time since I've been relapsing (early spring), and the student therapist I got matched with seems pretty nervous. I also feel like (based on my sessions last year) they think I am coming back from general school stress and social anxiety. I was really reluctant to go back to counseling but I felt like after the session today, I really do want to tell someone about my self harm. I just don't really know what to do because I don't want to drop this huge bomb on an unsuspecting grad student therapist (about my age) who probably thinks I'm there for general school stress. Wondering if anyone here has advise? 
Everyday, at school, I just get to much time to think. The thoughts are never productive, only self loathing and hateful. I listen to music but it's no longer making a difference. I tried drawing but my head just feels so fucking numb, I don't have any ideas of what to do. I haven't cut for 2 weeks, when I broke a 2 months long streak. I don't know if I'll hold on any longer.
Hey.  So I'm gonna be up front, I'm a little drunk.  I know that's the worst thing to do when you struggle with self harm (plus I'm an alcoholic) but eyyyy here we are.  The biggest issue is that I am way too tempted to relapse from self harm tonight.  Even just thinking about relapsing gave me a physical response (honestly, the thought of relapsing gave me a raging erection, I don't even know why), the likes of which I haven't felt in months.  Shit, I haven't *felt* in months.  I'm 2 months 12 days clean from intentional self harm.  I desperately, so so desperately, want to keep that streak.  But it's the hardest thing I've ever done.  I've quit meth and heroin, and quitting self harm was harder than that.  I dunno, I guess I'm just in an awful place and could use someone to talk to before I relapse.  If you're available, I would love a good chat to take my mind off things.
It wasn't until recently that I realized I've been self harming since as long as I can remember. I've always hit my head, thats my thing. I pound at it until I can't anymore. I don't know why I can't cope with things. Recently I have been taking to weed at every feeling of anxiety and even more recently the addition of cutting. I feel like I blow up and like I just have to yell at the top of my lungs but instead just bug out and smoke weed and cut myself until I calm down. Now people are starting to notice my arm which I should never have used anyway. I can see them looking but nobody says anything thankfully. 
Maybe a little clickbaity but my cat understands my self harm better than others can. Yesterday was a really shitty day so I decided to relapse because I just needed the feeling. Got into bed, got my blade, sobbed a little but the my cat rubs herself on me. Like an attempt to get my attention. She then starts to lick my cuts (previous cuts that are clothed, Dw PETA) I knew she understood I was in distress and needed someone. The only thing I need to do to repay her is a few minutes of belly rubs
Sorry if this is maybe the wrong thread? I just didn't know where to post. I have around 30 or so very visible scars on my stomach, and more that are less visible. All about 4 years old. I've been hooking up with this guy for about two months and now we're exclusive. We were super close beforehand, as he's a sophomore and I'm a freshman and when he found out I was attending this college (we went to the same high school and I had the same friends but I never really knew him) we started talking and really hit it off.The first time we hooked up I was drunk and said something like "I have scars sorry" and he was like "it's okay don't worry"I really want him to know that part of me and not think that I'm a total fuck up or anything. Not that he would, he's honestly the nicest person ever (and it kinda sucks that he's so nice sometimes because it's a complicated situation and I have really really fallen for him but we're taking it slow).I don't really know how to bring it up, because I kinda want him to ask but also I don't want to just be like HEY HERE'S A BUNCH OF OLD EMOTIONSif you guys could give me any advice about scars in relationships, that'd be great!
I have been free from self harming since 1.5 years. But lately I'm really struggling and I ordered some new blades.I'm not planning on using them rhigt away, but it's easier for me to resist cutting when I could, rather than not even having a choice.&nbsp;How do you handle this? Do you get rid of objects to self harm with or not?
First time I've ever self harmed and the day after all I really feel is ashamed and embarrassed. The arm hurts but I think is healing well. I feel embarrassed that my depression got to this point as I didn't think I would ever self harm. Im sad that it did get this far. A part of me is scared that I'll go back that road in the future to be honest. Its been a lonely and horrible week.
Edit: sorry if this is the wrong sub I can moveI'm in so much pain but I've rejected and wormed my way out of every time my friends and family have tried to convince me to be admitted  (I was kinda suicidal for a while and I couldn't hide it at the time) or even just go to an appointment with a shrink or whateverbut I think it's time I at least thought about it because I just turned 22 and I'm not going to get better I'm sorry for rambling but are there any good online counseling options for depression / anxiety  / self harm?I just don't know what to do
Between the negativity from the news/media/internet...and negativity from my father... i found myself resorting back to old ways to cope yesterday. not as bad as i did as a teenager...but still... i try to pass it off as my leg was itchy so i just itch it sometimes. then sometimes too much. then i'll go on  a sub reddit and ask for advice but generally the advice i get is harsh and brutal and lacking empathy, compassion and caring. A lot of the 'self help' sub reddits..tend to be hurtful in actuality. and then it makes me feel worse. 
Until this year, I hadn't cut my self in 3-4 years, I did use other forms of self harm though, this year has been one of the worst though, this is the most depressed I've felt in a long time and I feel as if it's getting worse, I started cutting again at the beginning of the year and everytime I manage to stop something comes along again and I feel as if I need to do it again, I've lost 4 family members this year and been told another is terminal, I don't know how much longer I can go without cutting again, last time I did it was about a week ago and it made me feel so much better, I didn't do many, just a couple one of which was me repeatedly opening up a heeling one that I'd done a few days before, I don't know what to do, I'm feeling more suicidal and my mood is so unstable at the minuet I don't know what could push me over the edge.. 
Tonight I majorly screwed up a timed exam for an important class, and had to work to suppress the urge to bang my head on the desk until my skull caved in.The mental images and the impulse were almost overwhelming. My muscles are still tight from fighting the urge.Academic performance has always been a life or death thing. I can't stand the fact that I was too dumb to complete the objective correctly. My immediate response is to hurt myself in some way as a punishment, or break down crying for a less serious offense like answering incorrectly.Does anyone know what to do in these situations? I'd also like to know what kind of mental illness this stems from so I can research it, be aware, and address it in a healthy way next time.
So much of my desire to hurt myself comes from a perceived lack of control over the other facets of my life. If I am anxious, but cannot do anything to fix the underlying problem, or depressed because I have disappointed someone I care for, I need to regain control over the situation. Cutting is an instant off switch for my negative thoughts. Once I see blood I can think again. It's the perfect stress reliever. Then I can focus again. The fog and darkness dissipate. I don't do it too often any more. I've found other ways to achieve the same clarity, but they generally require me to do something else drastic to my body. I'll hack off a bunch or hair or dye it. Or I'll get so stressed that I forget to eat for a day or two. Even with years of talk therapy I still haven't found more "normal" coping skills. Exercise isn't my thing (I've never gotten that fabled runners high) and mindful meditation always leaves me feeling worse because I can't shut my brain off long enough to just exist.It's ridiculous, but I suppose this works for me at the moment...

Well the election results are more or less solidified and I'm not here to get political at all but I'll just say that I'm a nonbinary queer person with very radical views on mostly everything and no room in my life for hate. Needless to say this change is hitting me very hard. Too hard. I've been drinking all evening. Alone. I started tapering off Wellbutrin yesterday and have felt very off as the withdrawal symptoms kick in. Today (the 9th) is my birthday. I just want to die. Maybe not die, but cease existence for a while. Press pause. I've been feeling more depressed and anxious than I have in a long time, especially anxious. The panic attacks have been unbearable. I started Zoloft yesterday too.The desire to hurt myself has been steadily building since I last slipped up nearly 2 years ago. The last time I injured myself before that was a year prior. So it's been a long time. I feel like tonight that's going to spill over and I'm going to just do it. I very well may not do it. Mostly out of fear because I have a very caring partner and a best friend who also has a self harm addiction and recently decided to never do it again (we had a ceremony to initiate that change). I don't want to hurt them. That's what's been keeping me from doing it but I really cannot take it anymore. Even just 1 mark. It's always been like a drug for me. If I do end up going through with it though...I'm not sure how I will cope with the aftermath. I need to learn to be gentle with myself. I'm always so fucking hard on myself. I'm my worst bully. I needed to let these feelings out. I told my partner that the thoughts came back but he is either asleep or still at the bar with friends.If anyone reading this has coping mechanisms for being easy on yourself after relapse it would be really appreciated...even for future reference. I'll be getting off Reddit for the night in an attempt to meditate but we will see how that goes. Either way I will be ok, but maybe not much. I didn't want to spend my 21st birthday like this but here I am. 
I haven't cut since January and I haven't been feeling depressed at all for like 4 months infact I forgot all about self harm and all my problems for a long timeHowever in that time I transitioned from secondary school to college (I live in the U.K., we go to college at the age of 16), leaving all my friends behind. To put it bluntly I HATE college, it's makes me so depressed and I feel that the only way I'm going to feel happy is be going back to cutting myself, although I hated doing it in the past I feel like I've lost something important to me, which I know sounds strange but I have a massive urge to do it. I don't really know what I'm asking, I guess I just wanted to express myself...

I struggled with self-harm from the middle of 2006 to the end of 2013. I finally quit because it was getting to the point that I was doing it to punish myself for even the smallest mistakes. So in essence I was doing it in part as punishment for perceived wrongdoing and also to relieve anxiety. I knew back then that it was an unhealthy pattern. I quit after I cut myself as punishment for the *absolutely heinous* (/s) crime of accidentally calling my friend by my ex's name. While talking to myself. So I decided to quit cold turkey then.But over the years I have slowly come to realize the actual reason I quit. I was afraid of getting caught. The absolute embarrassment I would feel if somebody noticed my wounds (and I did my best to hide them) was not worth the minute or two of relief I would feel. And I just have to ask myself, did I really quit for the right reasons? I know it's wrong to cut myself, but sometimes it just feels like I _have_ to. Because I _deserve_ to feel pain. I dunno, maybe I just wasn't ready to quit for good. I just fooled myself into believing it was better for me to stop. And now it's become pretty clear to me that my mental health has not improved one bit.I forgot where I was even going with this. But I need to get it out there. At least the Undertale OST is a good distraction...

I've stop cutting for a year but each and every day it calls back to me. I managed to hold on this long but I'm slowly losing my grip. At least its better then trying to off myself. Help?
Found out today that u/brokenbones has passed away. I don’t know if anyone on here ever spoke with him, he and I were pen pals and friends for quite a while. He used to be active on here but hasn’t been in a while. Just wanted to let anyone who knew him know of his passing. 
just needed to get this out. had more than a couple of shots on sunday, and i'd already been slashing my arm around with my exactoblade. i don't know why but at that moment i couldn't stop the cutting and i cut harder and faster each time. before i knew it i sliced open a good chunk of my arm. a good five inches of exposed fat that bled out of my arm as i stood there, euphoric and oddly satisfied at what i'd just done. but i looked at the floor and realized in horror that i was getting blood eberywheee. i got a towel and dabbed myself the best i could, but the blood kept flowing and i freaked out. i didn't call the hospital, my ex did. he was freaking out too. i feel bad that he had to witness me.after being put under the baker act and being required to stay in the hospital, im out and i regret so much but i also don't. they put me on medication - i probably won't stay on it. i'm required to go see my schools counselor, which i really don't want to do because i feel too ashamed about the situation.i got stitches on my arm. i don't know if i'm supposed to leave them alone or if i'm supposed to make an appointment with a doctor to take them out. my arm feels numb. i don't know if i cut a nerve when i hurt myself but i can't really feel sensation on my arm. i know this is all bad and i regret everything i did but right now i just want to cut all over again. it's so hard to distract myself without looking at my arm and wanting just feel the relief. 
I wrote this many years ago and thought i would share it with all you people. Maybe you can relateBleached and blemished stories,Oh so terminal and transistory.I reach out for forgiving,but I'm punished with history."I just need an adjustment", I tell myself,or an amendment of time.If I miscarry, I must carry,these bleached and blemished lines.My pear shaped endeavour,is perverted and wary.It is disconnected and severedand guarded and scary.I just need a release,or a moment of black.With this twinkling of peacethe shadows come back.I ascent to the challenge,but collapse to my heart.I consider the damage,"Why the fuck did I start?"But I hesitate this interrogationand get back to my work.I resign to my temptation"hello danger" I flirt.
I just pulled off some dead skin from my bottom lip, and it began to bleed a lot.After wiping my mouth and seeing the blood on my hand, I miss it.I miss cutting.I miss always have a certain way to deal with negative thoughts and relieve these tormenting voices.Please, any words of advice are greatly appreciated.I don't want to break this streak.This is the longest I've ever been clean.
I'm interested in how other people have made this project their own in order to heal from self-harm. What have you drawn besides a butterfly?Did you use regular marker or did you use sharpie? How long did it last with either of those?
It has been a while since I last cut. I never did words or similar things that often but I want to tonight. Maybe write something in binary along my arm. Maybe just a few numbers. Circles if I can do it. I'm not sure. I'm just waiting for my roommate to leave and then I'm going to find the pencil sharpeners. I'm not sure why I'm posting. I never really got to talk to my family about any of this in a healthy way. I guess I just want someone to listen. I don't know.
Pretty much the title. I have a Spotify playlist that always ends up playing when I cut. It's pretty much a sort of ritual now I guess. Anyone else do this?Edit: well here's my stuff copy pasted from a comment replyMy songs aren't necissarily sad or relevant to the topic, just emotional for personal reasons. For example, the [Flume remix of "You and Me"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUkkaqSNduU) is on there because it was playing during my last breakup and has that memory attached to it. Similarly, [Honeybee by Steam Powered Giraffe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojYK6CW8gdw) because that's what was our favorite song. I guess the most "depressing" song I have is [Forget It by Getter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMGQegj2iO4). Another one is a song I composed when going through some rough shit. It's never been released but here's [a recording I recently made for a friend who was curious about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl-ZXcxkhvI) I couldn't be bothered to properly render the audio so I just screen capped Ableton playing it
Sorry I just really need to rant a little bit. I self harm. For so long I've struggled not to do it and now it's like I always want to. I'm honestly scared. I don't cut deep but the fact that I cut at all makes me so disappointed in myself. The people I tell that I do this seem to not take it seriously. Like I don't want them to make a huge deal out of this but at the same time, isn't this serious? I don't know. And then when I hear others reasons for self harm I feel like there's no reason for me to be doing this. Like I'm an imposter. It's just been so bad lately. Right now I'm not home and I wish I was so I had privacy and my "tools" to do what I feel like I've been wanting to do. I wish I had someone to talk to about this. I'm sorry. I just needed to write this down. 
So, I usually cut on my upper thigh, but I had some serious mood swings over the last couple of weeks which led me to cut up my whole left arm. Some of the cuts are bad, but I made sure that most of them are milder scratches, because I don't want permanent scars all over my arm. I don't usually hide my cuts when I go for a walk by myself or whatever, but I do hide them at school, or basically anywhere when I'm out with friends or family. I really want to start wearing short sleeves, but I'm afraid of reactions. Does anyone out there have any experience with this, and does it seem appropriate to have fresher cuts our in the open? Some of the marks are older scars, but a lot of them are fresher cuts, and it's pretty obvious what they are.
I really don't know where to start. Two nights ago, we were in an arguement over some things. During that arguement I learnt that he had lied to me about some things which I was not pleased with. He was worried I would get angry with him if he didn't lie. I was very hurt. He knows that I can't stand lying above all else. I told him its very hard to trust someone who does that. He apologised.Later on in the conversation we got onto the subject of my self harm and cutting. I asked him if he'd told anyone else about it, to which he said no. I said "Are you telling the truth?" and he said that he was.Last night we had another discussion. He told me that he lied and that he actually had told two other people about the fact that I cut myself.I feel incredibly hurt right now. This isn't the first time hes lied to me AND HE KNOWS I can't stand lying. I've been fucked over too many times with people who have lied to me.He said he told another friend of his who cut to try and understand me, and he said he also told is psychologist and he wouldn't tell me why he did.I'm more upset with the fact that he lied to me, but was he in the right to tell other people without telling me first? The past 2 years I've known him, hes been a good friend. He's been there for me in some awful times and we've had good times where we've played games and stuff. I want to forgive him, but lying is not something I'm okay with at all. Especially when it comes to my self harm, which I've struggled with on and off for years. What do you guys think? He says he really wants to help me overcome my self harm and he says he wants to try being honest with me. But I don't know if I can trust him anymore. Feels like everyone I go to for help fucks me over. 
Used to cut badly on one of my legs and haven't done it for ages, don't want to do it again as I've come around 6/7 months however... today I got upset and violently punched my thighs in the bathroom I noticed it felt good and a release at the time but now I'm worrying that I slipped into basically another way of self harming. I was just so upset and needed a punching bag and bathroom was only place to get away. Is bruising yourself/ punching considered self harm? Should I be worried? Is it just another road to end up where I was? I feel like I need a slap of common sense. It doesn't leave any scars so at the time it didn't cross my mind I might've been self harming?! 
Ive struggled with self harm issues for a few months now, and a lot of the time I do it because I feel the need to hurt myself for the things I do. I always think to myself that its my own fault that im depressed, and that i do the mean things i do because im just a terrible person. There are people who are genuinely nice to me (they dont know about any of this) and i just say bad things i dont mean because i dont know how to respond, and i hurt myself for it later. Is it really my fault for all of this and how can i stop "punishing" myself for the bad things i do?
I don't know what to do to help her besides the normal "be there for her". She doesn't want to talk about her problems and I don't know how to get her to.
Cool. So it had been about two weeks since I last cut myself. Well, now I guess it's like 45 minutes, but you get the idea. The old cuts were just starting to heal. About half were scars by now, and the other half were scabbed over ready to heal that last bit. Now there's more. I don't know why I do this. I guess it's just to both feel something and take away the emotional pain at the same time if that makes sense. Like I feel absolutely nothing with emotions most of the time, but I also always have that dread over me. Saying I'm worthless and all those things. I can't cry. I've tried, I just can't. I've done everything, read sad stories, watched sad movies, listened to emotional songs, all that. The most I get is maybe some shivers I guess and a pit in my stomach but no tears. I tried just laying down and making the sobbing motion with shallow jagged breaths, but that didn't work either. This is the only way I feel anything anymore.Tonight was going well. I just played a gig and everything went well. I played my new song live for the first time, and people liked it. I got paid and told by the manager I'll definitely be coming back. But there's still that thing telling me I'm worthless, nobody cares. I guess this also keeps me from trying anything suicidal. I own a handgun but I'm giving it to a friend tomorrow so she can keep it at her place, at least until I feel better. It's a nice firearm (PK380), I sport shoot at a range and miss going there. But it's not a good idea to be anywhere near guns right now.I also recently went through some relationship troubles and I want to say I'm fine but I'm not. I want to be with someone again. I've been trying for a month to do that whole online dating thing but since I'm a guy (or maybe I'm just ugly or something) it's been pretty much a dead end. I've been on two dates, one of which was a disaster, the second one went well but she never messaged me back after that. I'm just giving up on that, what's the point of putting effort into it if I get a reply like 10% of the time. I'm just giving up in general. I know I don't need a relationship to be happy and tell myself that. But telling myself and believing myself are two different thingsThe only thing keeping me from driving down to Walmart, buying .380 ammo, and offing myself right now is the thought of my friend. None of the things I'm doing to help me is for my sake; it's for her's. Because I know it would devastate her if I checked out early and she doesn't deserve that. But that's literally it. I'm 100% confident the first thing I'd do if we stopped being friends is end it since there's nothing else left to live for. It sounds selfish and is, but that's just it. I used to have more friends and we just drifted apart. It's just her and one other person. And that other person betrayed my trust so I can't even talk to them anymore. They went around telling other people the secrets I told them. This is something that happens on the elementary school playground, not in fucking college. My music used to be fun but ever since I got signed and started selling it it's become a chore. I don't want to put effort into anything I used to like doing. I honestly can't remember the last time I played a video game. 
My younger sister, freshman in high school just admitted tot cutting. How do I process this and what should I do. I live in a pretty good family, Mom has depression so she cries sometimes. No economic problems or alcohol drugs. I'll just summarize the background. Sister dealing with poor grades (d's and c's) and my Mom getting angry at her. (I'm doing college apps now and have 3.7 gpa so Mom is worried about having to pay for scholarships so d's and c's would mean hard chance to get scholarships.) Week of homecoming, my Mom is yelling at my sister for not turning in assignments, sister goes to dad and says she hates herself and has long conversation with parents. She then goes to homecoming (she wasn't going before while my parents grounded her before this conversation). I was talking her today and it eventually got to where she talked about her cutting herself in which I had no idea. This is where it makes me sick that it all comes together. She asked for a pencil sharpener earlier that week (and we use a lot of mechanical pencils) and I gave her one (not knowing she cuts). She also wore sweatshirts a lot, even in the summer. She just kept saying she like sweatshirts and I thought she was just self conscious for being kinda pale. She was super open about it which was weird to me how she told me all of this which I would think be something that she wouldn't want to bring up and talk about. She said she was addicted and had done it multiple times. My parents know I guess and are trying to help her but what do I need to know or do?
So, many people may be aware of this community, and I won't call it a pro self harm community, because I believe that it is more for people to support each other through their struggles, and to be able to connect to people with similar issues to their own, but I am talking about the self harming community on Instagram. I recently started a second instagram account, maybe 3 days ago, and I use it to post depressing imagery, such as sad quotes and pictures of my self harm. I am not in this community for attention, I am in this community because I feel extremely alone and I felt like I needed to meet some people who are suffering with similar issues to myself. I have about 25 followers at this point in time, and I also follow several other members of this community. Basically, I joined this community by taking a picture of self harm scars on my arm, and uploading it with tags such as suicide, depression, selfharmmm, alone, bisexual, ext. I then began to follow several other people's accounts who uploaded similar images with those tags, and began leaving comments such as "I believe you can get through this, stay strong!" or "feel free to message me, I'm always here to talk". The reason I don't believe this is a pro self harm community is because nobody I follow, or who follows me is encouraging people to self injure, we all support each other and give each other advice on stopping. Now, the reason I feel uncomfortable in this community is that I have recently been feeling guilty about how people stereotype members of this community as self harming for attention. Now, I hide my scars. I am trying to feel braver about showing them, but I am not quite there yet. There is certainly an element of this community of people using it as a cry for help, but that is definitely not the main reason for any of us doing it, and there is a big difference between self harming for attention and self harming as a cry for help. However, I keep telling myself that because I am in this community, I must be doing it for attention, which is very wrong, but is what my brain wants me to believe. Since I joined this community, my self harming has lessened and I have helped others with their issues as well, so it seems to be a positive impact that this community is having on me, and I don't feel like leaving it would help, but I also feel uncomfortable staying in it, purely because part of me believes that I'm just cutting for attention, when I have been doing it for a year, and while I have done it once or twice as a cry for help, I have never done it just for attention. Any tips on what I should do? All answers are appreciated.
I'm pretty sure my cutting comes from an intense hatred for myself. I hate to even talk about it because my knee jerk impulse is to immediately swallow the feelings and convince myself they're gone and I'm okay. But I can't do that anymore, there's too much. I'm only 23 and too mentally unstable to handle basic things. I took a trip to visit my family. It fucked me up. How do you stop from cutting when you do it because you're an idiot, you sincerely just make, foolish mistakes. I haven't stopped hurting for years, I don't remember being happy, why am I doing this??? Why do I have to stay here and experience one let down after another. I just want to take my chances with whatever comes next. I'm tired. I'm just tired. Too angry. When is it enough? I guess. I don't want to bother.
That long ago, my ex-fiancee fucked up the happy little image I had built.Middle of the night, I wake up to hear crying. Roll over to see what's wrong, find her standing over the bed in her underwear holding a 21" knife over me.Since then, I have spent most of my waking time thinking about her, most nights dreaming about her, and nearly every day fighting the urge to relapse. Im tired of it, I haven't moved on, Im not getting better, and therapy didn't help.I just keep circling back to the last known good configuration, the last time that I felt like I was maybe okay.
Why is this still so hard to fight right now? Things have been going relatively well. My mood has been better and even started to go to some yoga classes - just for me to feel good and strong in myself. And I do.But now it feels like the urges are stronger. I think there is a part of me that know when I am stuck in a cycle of cutting, then it is obvious how much pain I am in. If I seem ok - then people will just assume everything is fine - and it's not. I am still carrying so much pain from childhood abuse and trauma. It's like I need a physical reminder to myself and others that I am not okay, that I still need to be loved even when I am not cutting....Sucks. I just want to start it up again....
I have been majorly depressed the past few months due to a combination of problems. I live in shitty shared accommodation and some bastard thief keeps breaking into my cupboard in the kitchen. Mental health services keep tossing me off. I have no one to talk to, therapy is an ordeal to get, waiting lists are months long. I saw a happy boy this morning, he was with his normal family. I wish I was him. I only had one abusive parent. That set me off. I am scared I am going to have a mental breakdown soon, I have reached out for help but have had nothing. Mental health services keep pushing me towards a group I don't want to go to because my ex is there. I went to the shop and bought some pencil sharpeners, so tempted to unscrew the blade and cut. Kratom has helped diminish the urge but it's not enough anymore. I am evil, ugly and pathetic. I need this.
I've been clean for a couple of months. But I've had a rough semester with a lot of personal issues and I'm studying for exams now. I'm finding it so hard to focus and all I can think about it wanting to cut. I don't want to. I want someone to stop me. Its just so hard to fight. I'm so stressed. I've never been so behind in work and my friends are all studying really hard where I can barely make a 30min session. This might sound stupid. It probably is. But I just want to escape it. I don't know what to do.  

So, I've been cutting a very large amount recently, and I've made about 20-30 cuts on the outer part of my left forearm, meaning that they are extremely noticeable. I usually cut on my thigh, but I've recently felt a strong urge to cut in different areas, and a couple weeks ago I went to town on my ankles. I'm not too worried about those scars because, being a guy, I'm expecting those scars to just get covered by hair, but I am extremely self conscious about the cuts on my outer arm. I've never been the kind of person to hide my scars, because god knows I have hundreds and hundreds of the damn things, but now I am hiding the cuts on my arm from everyone, even my parents. Why do I feel such a strong urge to cut in such noticeable areas if I feel completely terrified of someone seeing them?
I'm trying to not get hospitalized. It's been about a year and a half since my last hospitalization, and in that time I've cut once. I just miss all of it. Gathering my tools and bandages. I'd cut and watch the wound bleed for a long while, then bandage it up and take it, a sort of nursing myself back to health. I feel like doing all that "resets" my state of being to something more powerful, something better.I'm just sad, I really want to do it again.
There's nothing in particular that's wrong. No trigger, just the urge to cut. I made the mistake of looking at self harm pics online and it's like the desire to hurt myself snakes its way up through me and grabs ahold. I'll probably delete this post, I just want to express the struggle I'm currently feeling without worrying anyone in my life. It just never stops, and the more I think about it the more the edges of my mind blur and I just want to give in to the urge to slice myself open, bleed out until I can faint and take refuge from this addiction.
200+ days clean and I just can't deal with this, every single fucking day these thoughts harass me. I had a very nice streak when I didn't feel like this, but now that I'm stressed with class, shit's back. When I feel a little bit of pressure I start to think about cutting, because my dumb ass thinks it'll give me energy, help me to deal with exams and keep me focused. Also, I'm way too angry all the time, nothing helps me to relax, I don't even sleep well anymore and every centimeter of my body aches, so it doesn't help. This is a mess of post, but I had to let this out because I don't know how much time I'll be able to keep myself clean from cutting 
I'm so happy and proud of myself. I used to cut every day and now I'm halfway to 100 days! I can't wait for 100 days, then 200, then never again.
I haven't hurt myself in over 2 years. I've been so proud of myself and yet I just I can't stop thinking about hurting myself again. I'm depressed. I'm stressed. I can't eat without throwing up I can't sleep and I just feel like the only way to make everything go away is to just hurt myself. But then I stop myself because I remind myself of why I stopped to begin with. My mother and I remind myself that I can't do that to her. But I just want this pain and agony to go away 
i feel like i have to be perfect to go after anything i want. and not being perfect or feeling great, i distract myself with these pointless pursuits. 
Ive been opening myself up with razors, knives, pens, keys, etc. since my early teens and its getting worse rapidly. I went without incident for 2 months or so but it happened again a few weeks ago and that time I destroyed a nerve so half my arm has no feeling. another time i cut so deep that i needed stitches. I dont want to do this, but for many I think it relieves mental pain and bloodletting is peaceful. Its gotten to a point where I cant control it and I was wondering if there is anything one can do which relieves mental anguish but doesnt cause physical injury -basically a substitute. 

tl;dr - It really is a friend, not me. I don't have much experience with the issue and can't find adequate resources for help.My friend is a middle-aged female (45-50) who cuts her legs and stomach. She hates herself, hates her body, and has a poor self-image.    I find her more attractive than girls half her age, so it's hard for me to understand as a guy why she feels that way. She's been to therapy and found it useless, so she refuses to ever go again. She doesn't do drugs, but she is a functional alcoholic. I try to get her to talk about *why* she cuts herself, but she stonewalls me with "I don't know" every time.   It's my opinion that she *does* know, but doesn't want to tell me. She doesn't tell anyone about her cutting, but she will at least confide in me that she's done it. This last time was **really** bad and she asked me for advice on how to treat it medically since I have some basic knowledge on the subject.   There are only so many reasons to do it, right? I've read that some people like the rush they get from cutting. Others do it because they hate what they see. Some want attention.   I really don't know. She hides it from everyone, so I don't believe it's for the attention. She definitely hates herself, but for no good reason. She's incredible in my eyes. She doesn't deserve the hand she was dealt in life and I wish I could save her, but I know I can't. She's said exactly as much to me already, but that's not going to deter me from ever trying to help her. This is why I'm reaching out to the community here. If there's anything you can tell me about how I can best help her, please let me know. Direct me to the best resources. Something. Anything.   Thank you all in advance, with love.  
Hey there /r/stopselfharm. First time seeing this subreddit, just subscribed and thought I would share my story a bit.I'm an 18 year old University Student in Scotland, UK.I started self-harming when i was 14-15 because of some serious bullying. It started pretty "minor" because there was no blood drawn or lasting damage. Things like pulling my hair, punching walls, hitting myself, jabbing my thump in some pretty serious spots. After about a year of that, the effect wasn't enough and I started cutting. Weirdly, it was never on my wrist. It was on the base of my thumb, on the back side just above my wrist, then i started moving to my wrist. I did this for a couple months, before I cut too deep and reached the fat and had to go to the ER and get stitched up. I didn't do it for maybe a year because I was scared of what it could do. I relapsed after this year and cut even more. I'd been doing it ever since because of bullying, stress, even stupid shit like worrying about how I look at parties made me cut. *BUT.* That's one big but, after I finally realised I should be happy in who I am, I stopped. I'm clean for a year and a couple months now, not even thought about doing it because I'm happy. Life's been better since. Doing well in my classes, got supportive friends.:)So yeah, that's my story, and I hope to be around to help people properly and not with subjective "I love you!!!"s that people complain about. Thanks, Atimous.
I'm trying to be strong and get through this day. I can't stop writing my romance novel cause it helps me forget about the sadness.
I used to cut about once a week, then I stlpped and I relapsed and only did it about once a month. After about 8months of not cutting today I did it again.The reasons aren't even good, I feel stressed because I'm confused about my love live and I feel stressed about an exam i have tomorraow that isn't a big deal at all.I'm so fucking disappointed. I just want to stop feeling.
I'm also kind of afraid to cut because I'm not sure how sterile the blade is. I don't know what to do.

 I wrote this poem, and maybe it belongs here? I donno. But, here ya go:-WHY-Why am I like this?Why do I feel this?Why? Why? Why?The need for love,it over powers.The need for beauty,it over powers.The need to belong,it all over powers.I am weak.I can't hold on.I cry and I cry,I cut and I cut.The pain-a need.The blood-a drug.With out it, I'd die."Just once," I say"It will only happen once!"But I know it wont be once.I can't stop,the need is too strong.It makes the pain go!It makes the anger,the hate,the rejection,It makes it all go.I call out "Please!"But no one responds.They've all left me,alone,scared,wanting to die.I know I need help,but I figure-why try?Why would they care?After all,I am only one insignificant person.I am only one person!I am practically nothing!Why should anyone care?Why should I even be here?I'm just taking up space,using up oxygen,using resources that could be put to better use.If I wasn't here that is.If I was gone,would anyone care?If I was gone,would anyone notice?If I was gone,would anyone even stop to think?I doubt it.So I cry and I cry,I cut and I cut.The pain-a need.The blood-a drug.With out it, I'd die.Why am I like this?Why do I feel this?Why? Why? Why?
Title pretty much sums it up. Sorry for the X-post. I'm new to self-harm behavior & have never used this subreddit before. I had a med change last week (added an antipsychotic & dosage change for another med) & since then, I have had uncontrollable urges to cut to cope with these feelings & thoughts swarming in my head. I have followed through with these urges a few times since the med changes by cutting on hidden places on my legs. My intent is not to injure or kill myself.Although I've had a longstanding issue with suicidal ideation that is not what this cutting behavior is about. It is to deal with overwhelming thoughts & feelings. Don't get me wrong, I need to tell my psychiatrist & therapist that something is definitely not right. I would not even think about risking this if I didn't have a longstanding trust with my Dr & therapist regarding me knowing when it's time for me to go in hospital. I also know self harm is a really shitty long term coping strategy for my many years of therapy. I want to find a better way to deal with this ASAP.Some background info: I have never really cut before because when I tried it, it provided no emotional relief. For some reason it's different now. My diagnoses/issues are major depressive disorder, anxiety issues (I forget the exact title) & PTSD.The reason I do not want to go to the hospital right now is because I am in the midst of working with my psychiatrist & therapist to find a longer term residential psychiatric facility to get me into. I feel like an acute inpatient hospitalization would just slow down this process & complicate it. I have been inpatient in hospital many times before & I know it is not what I want or need right now. I would not be afraid to admit it if acute inpatient hospitalization was the best place for me right now.I know that last paragraph probably made this situation a bit more complicated but I hope somebody out there has had some experience in this or something like it. If not & you just have some other insight into this matter that you think I might be missing, I would appreciate that too. Thanks for listening & hopefully some guidance.P.S. I also have a peer-led support group tomorrow night (no professionals involved). Might it be safe to share this issue there or do I risk too much with someone possibly calling 911 or mobile crisis on me? If I don't want to go to the hospital, I certainly don't want police & EMS showing up. At least I know my Dr & therapist would trust me to get the hospital on my terms.
i just want to bash myself in the head. I never did this when I was younger, but a few years ago I snapped in a bout of depression and started hitting myself. It's so cathartic - it's the snap that says, "I have reached my functional limits." I can't go further than that (as in, I'd never cut or kill myself), but hitting myself is some sort of sick high that blocks out the chaos. I get too wrapped up in the fucked-upedness of near-concussion that whatever trifling bullshit I was upset about becomes null.I've been having trouble a lot recently with imagining bashing my head into something until nothing remains and I die. I could never do it, but it's a frequent thought. My head is just so stupid, so chaotic. I cause pain to people around me and myself. I can't get along with anyone who gets close to me. I hate myself, but people who deal with me as a peer think I'm so fucking awesome and have so much potential, and so many people have put so much effort into me and I feel so fucking guilty for feeling like such trash.I hate this.
Why wouldn't you do it?
I really fucked up last night and cut really deep. I have a huge gaping slash on my arm down to the fat layer. Currently under a dressing and waiting for minor injuries to open to get it checked out. How am I going to explain my lateness to work??! 
Unlike alcohol which usually builds up my negative emotions, weed kind of neutralizes me when I'm building up anxiety. Plus, it helps me go to bed and get a good sleep. Edit: Spelling
I balled my fist and punched myself in the head five times. I think I hit myself pretty hard. I saw a flash of white for a second.I think I'm okay. I'm scared, again.
Changed jobs a few months ago. A bit of background - I'm 35, attempted suicide at 19 yrs old. Still have depression/anxiety, but haven't felt the need or want to self harm really since that one time. Right after I switched jobs (went from the top of my game to entry level - still in the same industry but a very different side) I spent every weekend by myself, in bed, feeling myself falling back into the same hole I was in when I was 19. For the first time, I cut myself. Took out a switchblade and cut the fuck out of my leg. Called a few friends that I had helped through their shitty times. No one took me seriously. Left a note on my mirror telling myself to get help. That morning something clicked. I have an autoimmune disease that fucks with my hormones. My doctor has told me that for this reason, I cannot be on birth control. Never thought too much of it, but took her advice. However, two months in a row, I took the morning after pill. I had never taken it before. The last time I took it was August. I have not felt these feeling since. I finally told my mom the other day what happened (broad strokes, nothing specific) and it confirmed to me that it was my dumbass fault for not realizing that I should not be taking something like that. Now, this is not me telling anyone that there is an easy fix for your depression. I'm lucky that mine is controllable as long as I stay off hormonal meds. However, anyone that feels out of control and is on birth control or other hormone altering meds, please get with your doctor who prescribes them for you and see if there is a link. Again, I'm lucky, and my GP is also my OBGYN, so she has access to all of this information. Good luck to all of you, and please, PM me if you ever feel like you may do something. Usually all it takes is to know that someone else has been there. I wish I knew that when I was 19 and 5150ed over Christmas while my family cried 1500 miles away. It gets better. I swear.  
So today I hit triple digits. I wasn't sure if I was going to make it, honestly. This past week was really hard and I almost gave in, one of the things that kept me going was knowing how close I was of getting to the 100 days. Just wanted to share this. Next goal is 200.
I posted here last time this happened, but I was clean for four years until I started again last month. After I had done it again I hid anything in my room I could use to hurt myself, and since then when I feel the urge I just snap a rubber band to my wrist. Last night though I got creative. I took my shaving razor and pried the plastic apart to get the blades inside. It was one of those things where you realize what you did after you do it. Just staring down at the bloody razor blade thinking "what the fuck is wrong with me." I already called my psychiatrist, and we're switching meds around. I'm scared, though. I don't know why I do it, my body just shuts down and does the rest. I've dealt with this before so at least I have some resources to go to, but like last night, sometimes they can't help.
Hi /r/stopselfharm, my partner and I, who are seniors in high school, are doing a research project about self-harm motives and we are gathering data. We have an idea about motives already from reviewing articles and scientific papers but we want to gather data by ourselves and draw a conclusion from it. Every answerer will be anonymous and we appreciate you taking your time to answer it.https://docs.google.com/a/newschoolva.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGcgQrmcgmlVzE1RVWfkCYUKfQ7IfaBbm1xrTv1XW7yTVftg/viewform
I don't know why this is eating at me right now. I cut myself all through middle/high school, but never told anyone until after I graduated and started therapy.I had the same coach for cross country and track. He also happened to be my teacher for ap government the previous year and I was his teachers assistant at the time. I remember him checking to see if I was wearing a watch at the beginning of practice, as he made us all wear watches so we could time our splits on the track. He grabbed my wrist and pulled it up to his face half-jokingly to check to see if I was wearing one, and my watch slid down.There was no way he couldn't have seen the cuts. They were fresh and on the outside of my wrist. And he was holding my wrist about three inches from his face. He never said anything. Never did anything. People would of described us as having a close relationship. I wanted help so bad. I had been suffering for so long and the fact that he chose to ignore my suffering infuriates me.He had always treated me as an inferior to the other runners. Like no matter what times I ran in the race he would always make an excuse not to run me. He promised me senior year that he would run me in the relay team at the state meet. States came around and he told me I couldn't run because I had "asthma" despite the fact that I hadn't had an asthma attack during a race in over a year. He ran two other younger girls on the team with considerably slower times than me.He was manipulative. And I think think him ignoring my cuts on my wrist was just another thing for him to have an emotional hold on me. It's 3am and I can't get this out of my mind, I'm just so upset. 
Never posted here before. I relapsed a few days ago after around 5 months being clean. I only told my best friend. I haven't seen the person I've been seeing for six months yet and I don't plan on telling him just because I'm terrified of what his reaction might be. He started seeing someone else in a way and the stress of that along with general depression, family stress, and having such a hard time trying to find a job just kind of sent me over the edge. I really wouldn't want him to think that it was his fault at all. I feel terrible really. It's big and on my forearm and it's painful so I can't really pretend it never happened. I'm not sure how I'm going to go about intimacy yet either. I just want to know how to get over the guilt and regret and not let it fuel the cycle.
I'm 24, and have wrestled with depression for 10 years. I never engaged in self harm; Usually just coped with food, sleep, sex, or drugs. I was having a particularly stressful time last night (as my first day at a new job was today) and idly grabbed a razor and began carving into my leg.  The part that scares me is that I felt so much better afterwards. I slept better than I had in months. I'm worried that it might be my response to do this again if I start freaking out.  So this is two firsts for me: The cutting and the asking for help. I've always been awful at communicating. My roommates don't know about my depression. My girlfriend does, but she thinks 'depressed' is a synonym for 'sad' and doesn't understand how I usually feel. Though to her credit, it's not something I've communicated well. I felt like this experience warrants me telling somebody though. Kind of makes it easier with the anonymity.
ive been clean for probably a few months now. i found a girl who may be the one, she knows everything about me, even from my bad past. at the start she joked that if i was gay wed break up and stuff, but actually im bi... i kept this from her for a while, until she shared a previous relationship with me. it had some pretty heavy stuff in it so i told her about the only gay relationship i had ever had, just to stop my curiosity. when i told her this she got really upset and mad that i had kept this from her, from whats being said she might end up leaving me. she is the girl i lost my virginity to and planned to marry. the thought of her leaving makes me want to cut again, but if she actually does, i dont think id stop...
Now I'm 1 month clean, I don't know if I'll be able to keep it up, do you have some tips? I need simple tips that I can exercise in the restroom of my school.Thanks in advance. :)
For those unaware trichotillomania (if im spelling it right) is the act of pulling out ones hair. Its something i do because i enjoy the feeling, and it helps cope with anxiety. However i am prepping to see a self harm therapist, and i am wondering if this is something that constitutes as self harm. Or if any of oyu struggle(d) with it, and if you did how did you stop? 
I have some friends who told me to speak with them if I ever feel sad or something but I never know how to speak to them. I just ended the closest thing to a relationship I've had in a long time and I want to speak with someone, it doesn't have to be about this, I want to speak about anything
This has been the worst month of my life, and this week has been the worst time of my life. Yesterday I broke down and resulted to self affliction. Today was the same thing. I heated up a metal blade with my lighter and just pressed it flat on my skin. I used to not understand how people could do this, but I understand now. 
Hey everyone. Some years ago I used to burn myself pretty frequently (I was an addict then and now) on my arms. I started getting serious about recovery after a long road of awful things stemming from my addiction (getting sent to the psych ward, getting kicked out of school, etc), then after about a year/a year and a half I started burning myself again, but on my thighs to hide it better. I would try to limit the size, trying to rationalize my actions: "Oh it's just a small one." Now I can't stop and the injuries are much larger. I cry when I look at my thighs in the mirror: wasted goods. I look awful, I feel awful for doing this irreparable damage to my body. The scars will always stay on me; they're so big and dark and ugly. I will never be able to change this. Thanks for listening, I don't have anyone to confide in. Stay safe.
fuckI'll just copy and paste what I wrote somewhere else since it gives a good backstory. Its long but gets you up to speed. I just crossed out the parts that don't apply anymore so you still have context. >I've known this person for about 5 years now. We've been close and earlier last month I asked her out. She said yes. The day before the date she backed out. That was pretty much the catalyst to bring back years of repressed emotions into one big relapse into depression and anxiety. It's not the main reason, just something big enough to push over all the things I've just shoved into the back of my mind all at once. We decided we would stay friends and have been seeing each other like normal, but I'm still not over what happened. It's been a month and a half, she's already moved on, and I'm trying my best to still be friends because we've known each other for so long but it's hard. She texted me earlier saying someone asked her out and she's going to say yes. I don't know what happened. I just shut down. I know I should be over it. Honestly, I want to be over it for her sake, not mine. But somewhere in my subconscious it is still affecting me and I don't know how to reach that part of me. We've talked about what happened before. She just sees me as a friend and I want to see her the same way. And I try. But part of me can't let go. I've been talking to both my therapist and psychiatrist about it and we've tried everything. Nothing seems to be working, every time I think I make progress I go back to square one. It's like, what's the point anymore. Not just in terms of this specific situation, but in general. Whenever I try something things just go back to how they were.>I'm no stranger to self-harm and suicide. I was put in a hospital/psych ward for a few months after a failed suicide attempt a few years ago and things were ok after that until now. I'm recognizing the same pattern I was in back then is happening again. First it starts with the depression. Then the anxiety. Then the intrusive thoughts. Then the self-harm. Then the attempt at my life. ~~Right now I'm at stage three.~~ I'm really trying hard not to let it get to the next one but like I said before, I make progress and immediately fall back to how it was. The best way to describe it is a clock that's counting down. I can pause the countdown for a few seconds, but it will always start back up. It's inevitable. And that brings it back to the point of why even bother anymore. I've talked about it with her but I feel like I can't. She's having mental issues of her own and I don't want to tell her about this stuff, especially since it directly involves her. I just don't know what to do anymore.>My life is going well in general, school is going good, I have a job, and my music is finally taking off. I was recently commissioned to do a remix for a somewhat well-known artist. But it always goes back to "why bother, why try, what's the point". ~~The only reason I haven't started self-harming again is because of her. I know it would devastate her so I don't. Instead, I do the things I was taught to do in the psych ward like squeezing ice cubes and snapping a rubber band on my arm. But it's not the same. And I don't know how much longer until my feelings of depression overtake my feelings of wanting to protect my friends and family.~~ I've called hotlines and they help, but right now I'm at work pretending everything is ok and I don't get off for four more hours. I'm on my laptop so I can post here though and make it seem like I'm working. The only other person here will be leaving at 5 so I'll have the store to myself, but I still can't do anything if a customer walks in.So yeah. I did it again. I just shut down and it happened. I was in the back room and read the text. I saw the box cutter. I mentally checked out and my body did the rest/ I don't know what to do, I'm still at work. I just need to tell someone. 
I'm in a difficult place right now. Where I stay, I only have 1 friend within 40min driving distance. My other friends live in other towns and I'm hard up for money these days. Needless to say, I don't get to go out with the gang like I used to. I get pretty lonely... And the one friend I have here is busy, and never likes to go out and do stuff. If he does go out... It's with his other friends that just want to chill with him one on one to talk. I know what you're going to say as well... Go out and make new friends... Easier said than done! This town I live in sucks, and doesn't have a lot to do... And the bar scene isn't my thing. On top of all this... I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to; anyone that I can truly console in.
Alright, I thought I would never do this but here I'm.It's been something like 3 months since my sister started seeing a doctor about her situation. She looked fine, until I saw all that blood and the marks on her skin two weeks ago. I tried reaching her and told her if she wanted to talk about it I'm here for her and I wont judge her. She never said a word. Last night she was studying for a test till late night. I noticed she was a little ackward but I decided to let it go. By the morning when I woke up she already went to college. I went to feed the doga and saw  a massive amount of blood on a chair and on the ground. Crime scene level of blood. I went to her room and picked up the pijamas she was wearing last night and it was covered in blood. My mother found out as well and her first words were: "she is going to kill herself". And immediatelly started crying a lot and locked herself inside her room. My mother suffers from depression and is trying hard to fight her way out of it. But since we discovered that my sister is cutting herself she got a lot worse.I have no idea about what to do. I have a younger brother at the age of 10 that is constantly seeing my mother crying. I can't handle to see my sister kill herself, my mother dying from depression and my little brother future being ruined from the trauma of it all. I need any advice you can give me. I never thought my sister could actually commiy suicide until last night. And now I don't know what to do. CountessAmara lead to post it here from /r/depression. Any help is much appreciatted.

I need someone to talk to. All of my normal coping mechanisms are out the windows. I normally color, read, ride my bike, paint my nails, or browse social media. I've already exhausted all my social media outlets. It's almost 4am here and I'd wake someone up if I did any of my other coping mechanisms. Usually when the urge gets this bad I'll talk to someone, but everyone is asleep. Please help me!
Cut for the first time this week, now it's turning into a habit and I don't know how to stop. I'm asking for help but a big part of me wants to do it still.
I started cutting when I was a young teen. The moment the urge would spring up I would act on it. After several years the urges stopped and I didn't need to do it anymore. In December of 2013 I relapsed for the first time in six years. I was in an abusive relationship at the time and dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil. The urges hit me and I acted on them almost instantly. Since then, urges come and go, but I'm usually able to ride them out. A little more than a week ago, I was sitting with urges for several days. Suddenly a bunch of really bad things happened in my personal life. Dealing with that on top of the self harm urges became overwhelming. I relapsed and I'm feeling particularly ashamed of myself. Now the urges and temptation are even stronger than before I relapsed and I feel so pathetic for succumbing to them. I don't really know why I'm posting here or what I'm looking for. I just needed to tell someone, I guess. Thank you for reading
I haven't cut in almost a year... i have struggled with scratching a bit once or twice since then. How do you get through the rough days? 
I used to periodically pick; scratching, rubbing, pinching, and biting through the skin. I haven't done that for a little while, but last night before a 7:30am final exam this morning, I decided that instead of studying or going to sleep, I wanted to light a wooden skewer on fire and burn my arm with it. I burned a smiley face and now I have a fun little smiley blister. I likely am depressed in general, but there wasn't a particular trigger, finals are surprisingly not particularly stressful, I just haven't been right. Haven't been eating regularly, and holding the red disintegrating prod on my arm was just so soothing in the worst way. I just don't know who to talk about it with or what to say, it's just (obviously) been on my mind.

I almost cut today. Never done it before, but I've had experience with it. My girlfriend/ex/best friend  (it's really complicated)  self harms and I've always been there for her and have tried to help her the best that I could. We broke up August 15. The worst part of it, we were both madly in love, i was moving away and I could not put her or myself through a long distance relationship. That didn't work out. We've spent the last month and change trying to be as close to each other as we were, but we could never actually be there for each other. We both deal with depression, but I haven't considered cutting since 6 years ago. Tonight, we fought, she said that she couldn't handle this anymore. She hung up on me, I tried to do my homework. I ended up with my knife pressing into my knee, just about to break the skin. I can still see the marks from the serrations. I told her I needed help and she called. I told her what happened and she cried and said that she can't do this, that she can't be up this late. I guess she was still asleep or something. She finally woke up, and then asked why I sounded mad or upset. How could I not? She said I was attacking her, that I was hurting her with what I said, with what she said. She says she doesn't even remember that. I just needed to get this out before my next therapy session. Monday is too far away. 
I've been self-harming since I was fifteen. I've been depressed on and off most of my adolescence. I'm 25 now. I dissociate quite a lot. I've never seen a therapist for anything. Growing in a religious home, my family didn't necessarily think I was too bad off. I'd say I'm also manic. I go from really happy to really down. And sometimes I'm just numb. I've been going through a lot lately, and it all come to a head. For a brief moment, I actually considered suicide that night. And I've been haunted by those thoughts for years. I know I need help. I'm just afraid of going to therapy. I'm not as strong as my family thinks I am. And I don't want them to worry. My grandad is going through his third round with cancer, and I don't know where my life is headed. Once he passes, I'll lose the last person I really have left. I'm not even really over my grandmother's death and that was six years ago. I'm in a really bad place right now. 
I'm going through a really hard time with my (ex?) boyfriend.  We're separating because he loves me, but not in a romatic way anymore.  We share an apartment together and I don't think we'll be physically separating until January.  I'm still very much in love with him, but I've given up on the relationship.  I just don't know what to do to stay sane.
I just find it very calming when I see my blood dripping out of wounds that I causes on purpose.. I don't know why... It has been like this for years. Anyone experiencing the same? Do you have an explanation? 
For the past couple of days I have needed to so badly, but I am in a different state than my home and I knew I shouldnt put my "things" in my luggage. I need it and I hate myself for that... Im freaking out, Im crying and the anxiety attacks are for real honestly. 
I’ve been battling Hasimotto’s disease for a year now. It’s caused my thyroid levels to be severely out of control and has thus caused me to gain weight despite my best efforts not to. After a year of trying to get a referral to an endocrinologist I finally got one, once my thyroid became enlarged. I can’t get in for three months and the only way I can get in any sooner is if my doctor calls and speaks with another doctor and tells them it’s enough of an emergency that I need to be seen sooner. I had blood work done to check my A1C, hemoglobin and lipids because I have PCOS which puts me at higher risk of diabetes among other things and it came back all elevated. I am currently pre diabetic and they recommend a diet and life style change. Well no shit sherlock. I just feel so frustrated. I lead a very active and healthy lifestyle. I exercise five days a week, my diet is just the way it should be. So she starts asking me if I eat a lot of fried fatty food or this and that and it’s like your seriously like the tenth doctor i’ve talked to about this. I counted my calories, I kept a food journal I went and saw a nutritionist for two years trust me, it’s not me! I broke down and cried. It’s all out of my hands and so out of my control. I just feel so helpless. No matter what I do it’s not making any difference. All I can do is hope that at some point my thyroid will be normal again and then maybe I can finally start losing weight instead of gaining it. I just want to throw my hands up and give up. 
/**Edit: I just cut again today (the day after posting this). I haven't spoken all day to my boyfriend. When we drove home, he kept making noises. I am easily irritated by noises and he knows this. But I can't speak so I held it in. I put earplugs in to try to save my sanity. But don't you know that any time I value my own mental health and do something that increases my happiness, I am a selfish piece of shit for not caring more about how it would make HIM feel that I put in earplugs? Even though I know I need them to stay sane, he doesn't care. Nobody cares about anything but themselves. I'm sick of it. So he slammed the door and it was so loud it physically hurt my ears. I screamed involuntarily because the door slam terrified me. I have sensory issues and loud noises really upset me. I couldn't help but scream. So he, screamed back at me, "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED" in this horrible, enraged, judgmental voice. A few minutes later, we were downstairs. He put his phone near me so I gently moved it away from it. It was a light, gentle toss. I don't like when objects are near me on the bed so I simply tossed it to another location on the bed... nowhere near hard enough to hurt the phone, and it was still in his reach. He grumbled at me and I couldn't hear it all because I am wearing earplugs but I know he said something along the lines of, "it wasn't even doing anything to you". Why does that matter? Am I forced to sit right by a phone? Who is harmed when I move it away? WHY CAN'T I JUST LIVE THE WAY THAT MAKES ME COMFORTABLE??? I AM NOT HARMING ANYONE SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. I cut myself after he said that. I will not forgive him.*/Hi, my therapist knows about my cutting but I still can't stop or even temper the increase in severity and frequency. The urge is too strong. Whenever I feel the urge to cut, it feels like the very ground beneath my feet is shaky and about to give way. It feels like the world is infinitely hopeless and negative and my anger/frustration/depression spirals out of control. It must be some positive feedback mechanism in my brain or something. My cutting feels like a desperate grasping at straws, trying to regain the slightest bit of control over my life. "See, world, you can't destroy me! I destroy myself! Fuck you!" those kinds of thoughts. I don't believe any of this stuff intellectually, but the emotions do not listen to reason.I'm at school and have class in 1/2 hour. I have been cutting in more noticeable places so I will have to wear a sweatshirt.It feels like I have divided into two people. One is desperately trying to create a better life. She loves art, music, science, and nature. She used to create beautiful and cool things. She used to be funny too. She just wants nothing but the best for everyone and a long, fulfilling life.The other one is opposite. She is fueled by rage and composed only of frustration and bitterness. She is not exactly evil, but she is fed up with everything and basically lashing out at the world for being a bad place. She feels like a super villain whose motivation for evil deeds is a deep, uncompromising pain. She hates everyone, especially the Good Me. She will do things that Good Me specifically doesn't want. This is why I cut on a noticeable place, because Bad Me wanted to punish Good Me for spilling beer on the bed.My boyfriend is another trigger. I started crying last night, and felt suicidal so I made the handgun against my head gesture. (Like it looks like your hand is a gun being held to your head.) This was after an entire day of holding in and suppressing my suicidal thoughts, and after being ignored while sobbing in the same room he played on his fucking ipad. I know better than to tell people because when you tell them, they think you are doing it for attention and it makes them hate you so so so much. I dare not purposely disrupt another's day with my mental health. But I guess the handgun thing was enough to upset him, in spite of the fact that I wanted to do much worse. Like actually kill myself. But he doesn't care. He just said, "I'm not a psychiatrist. I can't deal with this." So I cut myself again. Partly because of frustration that I have literally no support in my life and am literally NEVER LISTENED TO IN THE SLIGHTEST, and partly out of guilt for letting my disorder harm another person. I cut for the second or third time that day. I was hurt and wanted to be alone, so I went on a walk. He followed me, begging me not to. He has no reason to not let me go on a walk. We live in what might be the safest place on earth and it was only 10 PM. I am 29 years old. I deserve and have the right to go on a walk whenever I feel like it, and I am not a bad person for choosing to go on a walk when my boyfriend prefers I stay home for some unknowable reason. Whether or not the people in my life want to accept this fact, I am autonomous.Regardless, he followed me. For some reason he was not wearing shoes...? He used that as an excuse to get me to come back. "I'm gonna get blisters if you don't turn around. I'm gonna keep following you until you come home." What a manipulative shitty thing to do--it is not MY fault you chose to chase me in the dark, when I wanted time alone, and it is DEFINITELY NOT MY FUCKING FAULT YOU DIDN'T TAKE 1 MINUTE TO PUT ON SHOES. If he was worried he couldn't catch up to me, he could have easily taken the car as I was visible from the street during my walk.He kept following me, so I gave him the finger and walked faster. All I wanted was the slightest bit of agency in my life. I am not a child. I need control over my life, as most adults do, in order to be happy and feel respected. But like all of my needs, this one is ignored and I am blamed for daring to even HAVE needs. "Why can't you just be happy without any of your problems being fixed?"At one point I desperately ran into a group of trees to shake him. He followed. I sat on a drain, enjoying the sound of rushing water blocking his accusatory, scolding, guilt tripping voice. This morning he asked me to look at his feet. They are covered in red, blood filled blisters. I felt guilty about it in spite of the fact that it was not my fault... and cut myself again. Right before leaving for school.He is here with me now. We go to the same school. He is my biggest trigger but I can't leave. The best I can do is stay silent like I have since yesterday. I will not speak again to anyone in my life. Why should I be emotionally available to others when they do nothing but hurt me? Why give them the gift of joking around, hanging out, encouragement, love, etc... all these things that I do because I want to help others.... but I will not be doing any of these things again until I feel like they treat me as more than an annoying obstacle. There is no love for me so I must dissolve into nothing.
I saw some funny SGDQ videos and then someone thought it was "cringy" that a guy had a trans girlfriend and so I found myself in a youtube video full of transmisogyny, and I just don't want to cut myself tonight. I have a lab tomorrow. Can y'all help me through?
Sorry for a slight repeat post from one I did earlier in selfharm, but I cut this morning. I've been clean for 10+ years, minus a small slip up maybe once a year or less. Today wasn't small, and I'm both stressed and really sad it happened. I don't know if I can hide it from my spouse, I don't know if I even want to tell my therapist (I see him to cope with chronic pain..). Am just feeling completely lost. I can't believe I did this...I lost control for one second after being strong and not giving in for so damn long. I didn't know who else to talk to. Thanks for 'listening'. 
I would love to share some tips with you guys.
i havent cut before i feel the pain would be intense but pain has started to feel good to me and soothes me like i have a foot pain like when i walk on my foot it hurts and the pain soothes me so i dont know if i should start to cut ive been having thoughts about cutting and suicide my friends have put me on suicide watch 
Sure there are still times when I miss it that it drives me crazy, but it's nice knowing you don't have to be paranoid about hiding fresh cuts every time. There are still moments when I feel like i'm gonna lose it, but therapy has helped a lot. I hope others get the chance to recover. I know I don't want anyone to experience the shit I've been through. And I hope that this post would encourage others out there not to lose hope. Things will get better. It won't happen in an instant, but it will. Good luck you guys!
I'm moving to another city, starting a new job, and I'm having a lot of marriage problems. I'm so stressed I can't stand it. I've been suicidal for 2 days and wanting to cut for a week. But I'm bound and determined to not let this stress make me relapse. This is freaking hard.
I've never done it. But all those thoughts keep popping into my mind all the time. "Imagine what it would feel like". I'm crying in my bed every night, listening to john frusciante. I wanna feel pain, just to ease the bland life. I can't sleep, my head is just reckless. I think about it during the day: my awareness just switches off and my mind wanders in a world of death and pain and suicide attempts. I think I might have trouble with school because of that.I wonder what if people saw my scars, and I just start crying and...I know from empirical experience, that everything I think about, at some point I'm gonna do it.It's midnight here and I'm ranting and venting and whining on a sub I've never seen before this night. Imma try to sleep. Maybe. Sleeping is what I need, I just can't sleep.
(abuse and eating disorder warning)So,,, I've been recovering from anorexia,, and my mothers boyfriend called me fat and gluttonous for looking for food after dinner,,, it triggered me very badly and I threw up the second I reached the bathroom, now I want to relapse with self ahrm so badly but I was doing so well, 3 months, I don't know how to fix it or stop thinking im disgusting and taking food from people who need it more
I had managed 3 years without cutting and now ive messed up i'm finding it a lot harder to ignore the feeling. Part of me is trying to ignore the feeling and the other half is telling me its okay, and we can start again in the new year.
one week clean off cutting and on the road to recovery!
I brought it to school wrapped in a bag and told him not to give it to me under any circumstance.Then I went home and found another knife to put in my nightstand. I don't know why, I feel like I CAN stop whenever but I just keep doing shit.
I'm a self harm addict. I cut frequently for 5 years and have been trapped in this addiction for almost 10. In the past 3 years I have cut myself no more than 3 times. I think that's pretty incredible seeing where I was. But I'm still an addict. I have triggers and think about cutting nearly every day. Lately life has been utterly overwhelming and my depression and anxiety symptoms have taken a turn for the worst. the urge is starting to become too much. I crave the feeling and my wrists frequently tingle like they're beckoning me to do it. Every day it feels like I'm being pushed a little closer to doing it. If anyone has any tips to soothe the thoughts and desire then I would love to know. I already do the rubber band thing and ice but it doesn't subdue the mental urge for me. Mostly I just wanted to share what I'm going through because I've been bottling it up inside and it's becoming too much. 
I have a very bad skin picking habit. Its not too noticeable though as it is mostly my scalp that i pick at, though it is giving me thin patches in my hair. I don't do this purposefully its more like a compulsion, just wondering if it is considered a type of self harm?
I'm right now trying to stop cutting, it was 1 week since the last time. But I need some tips to deal with the urge, I've already been told to intensly look att the area where I use to cut and then imagining doing it to someone else. It's working just fine this far but if you could give more advice that would really help me. Thanks in advance :)
I just want to let all of you know how empowering and inspirational you all are.  After 137 days of not cutting I relapsed last week...  Instead of cursing the myself and falling back to old ways I looked through old and new posts here and I know now it's NOT the end of the world and I will continue to grow and stop this way of dealing.  I hope for everyone here that we all grow and find hope and strength.  Again, thank you and talk to me or anyone here for help!
I just know that I'm going to fall into the urge sooner or later. It's inevitable, I can feel it building again and my support circle is so small I can't keep bothering people for support or a distraction. I don't even think my roommate knows I still cut myself. I guess I should look on the bright side as this is the longest I have gone without in a long time, probably a few years, I honestly can't remember. 
I cut today because I'm overwhelmed. I lost my job and I have bills to pay. I'm in my first semester of college. My car is having problems. I'm lucky enough to have my family support but I feel pathetic for asking for it.I hate being the way I am. I'm so damn tired of being this way, I've tried to change I've tried to be better. I hate that I'm an idiot. I hate that i was traumatized and fucked up as a child. I hate that I'm depressed. I just want to stay high all the time
I decided to give back to my community and organized a food drive. My goal was to collect twenty pounds of food but instead we collected 300. I feel really good right now. Just wanted to give a reminder to everyone on here that you can make a difference and that you have the power to do so much more than what that voice of addiction tries to tell you other wise. You are worthy and you are important. 
Thank God she believed it.
Just wondering if slapping, punching, rubber-band snapping qualifies as self-harm in the sense of the phrase used here. I've cut maybe twice in my life, and very often have the impulse/thought to do so when I'm very angry with myself or want to punish myself, but I almost never follow through. So I often turn to slapping myself in the face, on the wrists, and putting a rubber band on my wrist and snapping it over and over it again. Sometimes I punch walls and other things to hurt my knuckles. Obviously these things hurt and leave the skin red, sometimes with welts, but that's it. Is this self harm? Something I should be worried enough about to speak about to my therapist, for example? 
A couple of years ago it was pretty bad and I cut myself almost everyday. I knew then why I did it because I was lonely and I felt no good, it was to think about something else and I love the way the marks feel afterwards. It was a distraction. I started to write poems instead of cutting no matter how tempted I was, and it cut back self harm immensely. I only cut every now and then but it was with a knife. And the last time before last night I was 5 months clean. Well recently the urge kept creeping up on me and I don't know why because I'm doing so much better than before. Last night was the first time I used a razor and it was the best thing ever. I wasn't even depressed, I actually felt crazy at the time. It was such a thrill, I don't want to do it again because I know it's bad for me but at the same time I love the new rush and watching it get bloody is cool. I don't know how to stop.
Recently went into a total self harm blackout mode after taking a few ambien and ended up cutting myself pretty badly.. not proud of myself and I keep getting extreme impulsive feelings next to any kind of sharp object and my mom keeps talking about sending me to a mental hospital inpatient program but I don't know if it'd help
I have so many scars on my wrist and legs and i always have the urge to add more. I get clean for like a week at most and then i break that streak
Broke a 2 year (plus some change) streak tonight.  I wasn't even smart and my wife is gonna see.  I'm gonna have to answer for that in the morning.  That won't be fun.  It wasn't worth it.  I thought it would be at the time but it sure as shit wasn't.  I regret breaking my streak.  But hey, when I wake tomorrow it'll be Day 1 and I'm gonna do it right this time, I hope.  That's what I'm most excited for at this point, the reset to Day 1 cause I know I can do it right this time.
I know 2 months doesn't sound like a long time, but for me it feels like years. Every single day I want to scratch again but I made a promise to my fiancé that I wouldn't scratch as long as he didn't hit stuff. Well he hit stuff two days ago in anger and broke our promise. Now (for many reasons which I won't bore you with) I'm lay in the bath before work and it's the only thing on my mind. Please guys, how do I stop myself? Please. 
I have this strong urge to cut... a large artery. I find myself touching it, feeling my pulse, and imagining getting the big knife my brother bought me (for self defense), stabbing into this spot and dragging it down the artery. *I know this is awful and I am ashamed* and it's been in the corner of my mind since Saturday, whispering lies. That damned inner voice always lies. "It won't really do that much damage, you know. Nobody has to know. It'll feel great to see that much blood, but you're great at first aid and can even fix a wound that needs stitches!" I am not that great at first aid. It could harm me a lot. I can't handle anything that serious. The voice is a liar and won't leave me alone. I'm an adult, damn it! Why won't this thought go away?
My ex boyfriend raped and emotionally abused me (not letting me have male friends, purposefully misgendering me, calling me a slut for being molested by someone else in our relationship), and he's been telling my friends I was the abusive one for standing up to himself. I knew he was telling, but I didn't really care too much bc his friends were all loser shitheads, and my friends knew he was lying. It did shock me a bit, but nbd. Nobody except his 3 shitty friends believed him and his shittiness never left the friend group. Except now he's posting about it on tumblr where he has an audience and I've been getting some messages, from the "oh you're a piece of shit and you hurt your ex you bitch" to the obscene and lewd and dealing with ptsd and depression and school starting and now these scary messages I cut again I fucked up I can't tell anyone I don't know what to do I can't tell my girlfriend but I'm on the phone with her atm I feel like such a piece of shit I feel like telling her would be the right thing to do but I don't wanna seem like an attention seeker or a special snowflake idk I'm sorry for rambling
I cut for the first time with a razor. I know i need help but I've got no one. I want to disappear
I haven't cut for 11 months, no self harm at all but I'm having horrible urges and I don't know how to stop them. 
This is new to me. I have had two... sessions.. two different days (the previous two Sundays) of deep urge to just fucking do damage.. in which I self harmed for the first times.I want to burn like last time, or properly cut... I chose where. I ache to do it today but I'm scared. And my 10yr partner lovingly tells me NOT to do this. It is so painful for him. It is fucked up to me how it feels inevitable... like what have I opened... I don't want to go too far down this path, yet I'm not ready to stop, yet I don't want to hurt people. My beloved friend has told me to at least.. [feed the right wolves](http://www.oneyoufeed.net/tale-of-two-wolves/) over this... I am doing a medium to poor job of that I think even though I philosophically agree.I know my title asks for help.... I don't know what I need. I don't know if I can be redirected or if it is inevitable for now. I really don't know anything and I just want to cry or sleep.
as time goes on i keep thinking more and more about going back (it's the only thing i know that can successfully make me cope), but i know that i'll just be like the other times (if not worse) and the cycle will continue, what are some reasons you tell yourself to not do it? 
Perhaps this is the wrong sub, but it seemed applicable. I was recently asked for advice by a friend whose daughter is prone to self harm. He was trying to find a razor that his daughter could shave with, but that couldn't be used to cut with. Knowing little, I turn to Reddit. I thought maybe an electric, but he wasn't sure it would be safe. Does anybody have any ideas?
I had a really shitty day today. One of the worst in months, or maybe a year. I couldn't control myself any longer and I fucked up. I'm sorry.
I self harm in two ways. One is through impulsive means, the other is through addictive / punishing means. I usually take a knife to my skin, which is the self punishment, while the impulsive is hitting my head on any hard surface, usually until i pass out. is there any way to stop either of these? i've tried ice, distraction, etc, but nothing seems to help me.
Hey,Thanks for taking time to read this, need to vent.I don't know who i am, to be honest i never have.I cut myself in the past on impulse with anger and furstrstion.Now in recent terms i do it to gain control and to feel something from the numbness. Never felt numb before until recently, since the back end of 2015, i get numb and it feels like i cant move. Only way to feel is to cut.I am being treated for depression/anxiety, i feel like it is deeper depression or something more, not sure :(I need to find myself, my identity.I feel this is the answer to help manage a bit better.
Like the title says, I've been clean for 5 days. I really really want to get to a week clean. I've been starting to feel tempted again. How do I prevent another episode from happening?
but i dont know what to say. i am not experienced with this whatsoever but i need to do something to help. he recently began cutting himself again, and talks about how it makes him feel good and i dont know what to do. please help
Not in this position. But trying to be in a position of selflessness rather then selfishness. Understanding of such a position to help one or ones out. I met my SO and never had or have to worry about just a one night stand or meeting someone. Fortunate for that. One of those things added to the list of reasons I'm not good enough for her...anywho before the self loathing takes hold.   Basically, I'm curious how does one go about (guess a couple of assumptions here, can definitely be an ass, for both of us) finding new friends, or even new 'friends with benefits'. Idk. I know my own mind, among a lil of my SOs and one or two others, and the masochistic bunch usually seem more guarded. Here and there someone trusts too fast, but how often is society accepting something that has been around longer then the printing press. (A brains a brain a brain...if some of us are compelled to..maybe some of us are..just like some murder, some cheat, some lie and steal. Environment and brain.)    Idk. Just feel it could be hard, going out to a bar, a park. Yeah, relief might be there. But the pool of blood doesn't reflect my self esteem. It doesn't reflect that I can have any more of a positive impact on anyone's life whatsoever. So while the craving for human contact is there..idk. plus, as I said, I got my SO...hopefully will never have to worry about such a course...almost upsetting to even think about, maybe thats why I am. Idk. Sure Im not the only one who gets tricked by themselves in this state.
I do feel good after hitting myself, like a punch to the stomach or face or punching a wall till my hand is bruised, if i'm super frustrated or stressed i feel a powerful headache building up in my head, if i start hitting myself i feel the pain dissipate, this is still self harm, isn't it?
I'm trying to get through some really strong urges right now and I'd like to hear other peoples' reasons as to why they are trying to stop. My addict brain is trying to rationalize me possibly harming myself by convincing me that the pros of recovering aren't better than the feeling I get from burning myself. Why are you in recovery?
Hey /r/stopselfharm,I wish the best of luck and strength to everyone out here struggling with self-harm, things will get better believe me.**(Excuse the English, me no speak americano)**I've come here with a question and hope I can get some advice from you guys. Since my 15th (17 now, almost 18) I've been having some problems with life in general to be honest and I used to deal with them by doing drugs. I've been very lucky to find an amazing group of friends who helped me get my life back on track over the course of the last year which resulted in me living a lot healthier and using less. I'm very thankful for all this but last month I had a moment where I completely broke down, it was like everything just came out at once and I cut some pretty deep cuts in my biceps as a way to '*feel something*' I guess. I now have some very visible scars and I'm guessing they won't fade too soon.Now I know people won't always be understanding when they see self-harm scars, before I did this to myself I was thinking the same way. I thought it was just some emo bullshit that only 14yr old girls would do so I'm definetly not blaiming others for thinking that. Anyway, I'm not planning to hide my scars and I've definetly seen people stare at them before so right now it's just a matter of time until someone makes a funny comment about them or asks me what they are from. I was thinking to reply with the truth when that questions comes up which would be 'It might seem emo as fuck, but I used to have trouble with drugs from a relatively young age and eventually I just couldn't take it anymore and broke down with the scars as a result'. Now my question for you is, how do you explain your scars to others and what would you advice me to tell people? I honestly don't wanna deal with the bs that comes with them but at the same time I'm not ashamed of them, when I look at them it makes me feel strong in a way. Like an obstacle I've overcome.Please feel free to ask any questions you have and every helpful reply would be appreciated!-Thanks in advance guys, stay strong
I cut myself and it got really messy. I locked myself in the bathroom, my roommate broke into the door and found me laying in the bath covered in blood. They were really upset and stressed out and left. I feel awful about doing this and putting other people through my own pain. I do it because in sobriety I have very little pleasures and stress relief and it's a release for me a way to regain control over my life that's falling apart.  I'm in a really bad place emotionally and I don't know where to turn. I can't do this to the people I care about anymore.
When I don't have the guts to cut, and when I do. I feel like I have to be a constant pillar of strength and calm and positivity for my family. And I'm just so damn tired. I feel like if I show any sort of 'negative' emotion, my husband panics and says thoughtless things and then I get blamed for not being calm and reasonable twenty four seven. 
Today was incredibly rough after a rough couple of months and I didn't even consider cutting myself. I just wanted to tell someone, because it's the only good thing about today so far. This year I was sick for over ten weeks straight. I was in constant pain, constantly nauseated, unable to walk more than a block without almost puking and no doctors were giving me any answers other than to wait to get better. I did after surgery, but I had to drop out of spring quarter of my out of state college and return home, leaving behind what felt like my entire life (friends, school, the city I'd grown to love, the place I'd lived for the past two years without being away more than a week) and my future since I was dropping out of school. Luckily, I had a surgery and was fixed up. I feel so much better and am finally able to return to school. Only to find out because of missing a quarter I am being denied financial aid by my school. Today, my scholarship from an outside source told me it might be revoked. I had told them about my withdrawal and still been awarded aid for this upcoming school year. Only apparently when I told them, they forgot to factor that into my upcoming application instead of just the current aid I was receiving. I tried so hard to stay in school but couldn't because of things completely beyond my control. I have great grades except for this one quarter and yet everyone is telling me I am a failure simply because I got sick. It's worth mentioning what ended up being wrong with me was my appendix and there is no known way to prevent or make yourself less likely to get an infection there. So, I literally had no control nor made any decisions that led me to this point. And today I was told the one last bit of aid that was keeping it possible for me to return to my schooling and my life might be ripped away. It feels more unfair than I can explain because I did nothing wrong. I notified everyone in a timely matter and was constantly told I would be able to return to school in the fall with my aid. So broke down crying to day, I hyperventilated with anxiety. I freaked out. But not once did I try to harm myself. There were times when far lesser things would send me into a tailspin of cutting, but today I coped with things with a normal emotional break down. It feels really good to have at least one part of my life figured out even if everything else is falling apart. Thanks for reading, I just really wanted to share.TL;DRI got sick and now all my financial aid is being taken away for college, but I didn't cut so yay!
Got into an argument with my mom. I haven't cut in probably almost a year. I feel like I need it again. I just want to be bloody and free.Help.
Hi my name is knickerbockerglories and I'm an addict.I haven't cut in almost 10 years, but I've never stopped being addicted. It started out as a coping mechanism for anger, turning the violence inward rather than lashing out at the people around me or picking fights. I regret ever starting because it made me realize that I'm an extreme masochist. I love the pain of it, it's so fresh and bright and the rush makes me feel so alive. Just thinking about it makes me breathless and my pulse quicken, like fantasizing about an old lover. But in this case, the old lover is abusive and forces you to dress in stifling clothes and alienates you from society.Outwardly, I'm well-adjusted. I don't have scars anymore, I don't feel anxious about going to the beach in a bikini, I have a loving boyfriend who understands the addiction without encouraging it, I have a stable job and a neat apartment. Inwardly, I want to give all of it up to feel that rush again. I keep expecting to stop wanting it one day, but it's been 10 years. The dull ache of self-denial has seeped into my bones; it makes me so tired. I read so many posts from ex-cutters at 3 months, 6 months, one year, celebrating the fact that they don't feel the urge anymore. Is it still reasonable to hope that I'll feel freed in the future? Maybe when I actually hit 10 years? maybe 15? 20? I'm not sure why I posted. Maybe I'm hoping someone will tell me, oh don't worry, at 10 years on the dot all your brain chemistry will magically get unfucked and you'll be able to be happy and relaxed like normal people are. Maybe I'm hoping someone will say that it's okay to like pain and it's okay to pursue it. I just want something to change. It's exhausting to want and not allowing myself to have. 

He's not mean mean. But he comes across that way a lot. He snaps at me and I'm really sensitive. Especially today. When he snaps, he excuses it by saying he's tired. I royally screwed up last night and I feel guilty. I already feel like hurting myself because of it. Then when he's like that, I wanna hurt myself more. Like. I can see it happening in my brain. I picture it and it makes me want it
Do they help people who want to self-harm? I don't want to do it again, the psychologist doesn't seem to help and I don't know whom to turn to. (I'm not in danger.)
I haven't cut in 4 months and have had several urges and hard moments of holding back. Right now I believe hurting myself wouldn't be too bad if I hide it well. I am showing my scars since a while now and I'm proud to make progress, but I still need help and treatement. Two weeks until I have my first appointment with my psychologist. I just want that feeling again, just for a bit. I hope I won't regret it all too much. I don't want to feel more depressed. I kind of feel stupid already, but I might hurt myself again now. 
I quit self harming 4 months ago. I am very proud of the process I've made. However, I keep getting urges. I know this is common, but they are more difficult to ignore each time. I want to create something that is special and interesting and I come up with the strangest ways of cutting my arm. I have no intentions of dying anymore, but I'm still suicidal. Self harming always made me feel like I'm closer to death and made me hate myself less for being too afraid to end myself. Now I'm stuck with pain I can't bring to words which builds up as I'm keeping most of it to myself. In the end it makes me feel like there is no purpose and it makes me want to die.This is rather a rant than asking for advice, I am lonely a lot and wish to express myself in a way.
I volunteer as a mentor to year 8/9 students (ages 13/14) in a local school. I love doing it, and alongside my job I get to inspire people about STEM subjects, help them on their career paths and mentor them through their teenage years.**BUT**I am worried that the visibility of my scars could be either triggering or a validation of s/h being the norm or OK. I don't think my mentees have any problems, but if these impressionable kids (at age 13/14 you're pretty impressionable) see scars on an adult's arm, what message does that give them? I don't even think about my scars now and so there have been times when I've been in a session wearing short sleeves, not even realising it. Am I in the wrong here? *FYI my scars are not new or extremely obvious, but are all very raised and white against my skin. Like, you'd notice them if you glanced closely enough.*
"I'm in no way addicted to cutting my self".... is what I tell my self as I'm doing it. The girl of my dreams left me a few months ago. I had the money saved up to buy her an engagement ring. I thought she was the one. But apparently love can be a one way road. To make things worst she just moved in across the street. I spent last night crying and begging her to take me back only to have her shut the door in my face. The anxiety kicks in. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I feel like there is a 100 pound weight on my chest. I'm shaky. In between the tears and the gasping of air I grab the knife I keep in my night stand. And I hurt my self... Sadly, I feel like hurt isn't the right word because in my sick twisted world if feels good. The harder I press the easier I can breathe. I find that many short not deep cuts helps me the best. After it's all over I stare at my wrist. Is this what I have become I tell my self. Am I so disgusting that even I don't want my self. I'm on medication for the anxiety but a pill can only help so much. When it feels like no one cares. The pain shows me I'm still alive. It stops the emotional death inside of me. I don't know what's harder. To tell my self that it's going to be alright, or to tell my self that I should stop hurting my self. Because why would I stop something the makes me feel better?
The worst thing about a relapse is how indescribably amazing the first cut is. The razor breaks the skin and you feel the blood come rushing, and the instantaneous sting of the water rushing over it. Your mind immediately feels the pain, and reacts to it in fear, your face wincing for it to go away but then. Then your mind betrays you. Then everything feels faint, and the world sounds dull. You forget everything that caused this, and you forget everything that could bring it back. All the voices in your head go silent and you can finally hear yourself.But eventually the voices returnAnd your brain reanimatesAnd you can hear againAnd suddenly everything comes back with a vengeance that hurts so much more now that you've felt relief.So you try again, and again. Days after days trying to get back that first response. Cutting deeper and deeper and letting more and more of yourself fall down the drain. Someone will see it eventually. Summer will come and you'll need to let your scars heal. Eventually you'll be off it againBut you'll always be waiting for the next first cut.
I cut a lot when I was 14 and have since taught myself how to cope but when I get really in a bad place and don't care about many things I want to do it again and when it's really bad I do. I dont understand it's been so long and i feel like i'm so close to being completely done with it but then I do it again and it still makes me feel better and i know it shouldnt. 
I'm sick of being responsible. I'm sick of having to hold my life together and seem fine when I'm crumbling underneath. I am ashamed of my need to cut. But I want to embrace it. I wonder what would happen if I didn't hide my cuts so carefully? What would people do if they knew I wasn't OK? I don't think I could ever tell anyone. The fear of others, especially my husband, seeing my cuts is what stops me 90% of the time. But why do I have to worry about everyone else all the time? What about me? What about my pain? No one cares if you're constantly on the edge of crumbling if you don't actually crumble. No one even notices.I've always had to be the responsible one, I can't totally give up or break down because slowing down or lapsing in my responsibilities just is not an option. Life must always go on. But then it never seems bad enough for anyone to care or help, even though I'm just barely making it.But who takes care of me when I can't go in? No one, because I must always go on. Even when I can't anymore. 
I did it. I have conquered a mountain I didn’t think possible. I finished my book that I set out to write two years ago. When I was having urges to harm or when things were going not so smoothly I would turn to writing. I channeled the good the bad and the ugly into something productive. There were days when I thought I would never finish, that it would never see the light of day and that no one would like it. But I told that voice of doubt and fear to take a step back, that I had this even on the days when I felt less than confident. Sometimes when we invest so much into something we can lose the big picture. It becomes hard to see all the hard work we’re doing and have done. Take a step back. Everyone on here, no matter what your current situation, has done well. It might take a while but you can do it. Here’s the link for those that are interested:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JP6YHUS#nav-subnav
I've been self harming for almost 8 years now, since I was 12. When I was 16 I attempted suicide and my fam/friends found out about my depression/anxiety/self-harm. After that I never felt the need to cut very deeply or daily the way I did before, but I do still cut deep enough to scar when I'm feeling upset or angry or anxious.The only downside to cutting is other people's opinons for me. I hate that I know they'd be upset and worried if they knew I still cut. Even so, I don't feel guilty about cutting because of that, just annoyed that other people want a say in my body. I like my scars, I like the way cutting feels, I've been in therapy and been on meds and neither has been as effective a measure for making me feel better. I don't really understand why non-suicidal self injury is perceived so negatively.I guess I'm just wondering what I'm missing here. It feels like everyone sees cutting as this hugely terrible thing, and I just... don't. And feeling like that just makes me annoyed and makes me want to cut more.
Recently I have been cutting. I did cut a little about 10 years ago for different reasons.  And I never thought it would be something I would do again. However, lately my mind has been running with horrible thoughts and I am having a hard time with self-worth. I feel even more stupid because my life isn't awful, I have everything I could ever want. I'm in a serious relationship with a man that I love deeply. I'm going to be graduating from post-secondary soon. I enjoy my current job. But I'm just stuck. I don't have anyone who I can truly talk to. I want to talk to my partner so bad, but I feel like I will only hurt him and I don't want him to think he has any part with why I am cutting. I know it's just my mind not allowing me to be happy but I can't push those thoughts away. And so the only I have found that snaps my mind back to being okay is cutting. I've been cutting on my upper thigh this time because I thought it would be easier to hide. And it just allows me to take a deep breath and clear my mind by focusing on the sting and blood. And it seems the more blood the more satisfying. Sorry for the short novel, but I knew I needed to just explain myself somewhere. I don't even care if no one replies, but I needed to tell someone. And sometimes a stranger is just that. 
Throwaway for reasons.My daughter just moved back in with me this summer after living primarily with her mom for 7 or so years (joint custody, I've been involved in her life from the day she was born.) When she originally talked to me while in the process of moving back, she said she has experienced some form of molestation by her stepdad. My first instinct besides rushing over there and beating the shit out of the bastard was that she needed to feel in control of her own life. I've been letting her tell me her story in her own time and not pry. I have also strongly urged her to tell her mother, and to report to the police. She does not feel comfortable with that though, as she is worried it will hurt her mom. I have been very clear that her mother would be glad she told her, that it's not my daughter's fault, and that her mother would do anything to ensure she's safe, just as I would. I've been trying to get a hold of my daughter's insurance card so that I can get her in to see a therapist because she's been struggling with anxiety, and possibly depression. Now I find out she's been cutting and I feel even more helpless. Did I do the right thing by working towards letting her take back control of her life? Is there something more I can do?Excuse me while I go throw up.Edit: Thanks to everybody who has been helping me through this. Once I got over the initial shock it looks like we are on pretty solid ground. I feel things are going to improve from here.
I think I want to tell someone, but I am a PhD student and do not have time to take a week off or anything like that for inpatient. When I went to the college counselor office earlier this year and told them that I used to do it (as a test run for what would happen) they said they have a legal obligation to send me to the hospital if I'm hurting myself. I'm just wondering what the whole process encompasses so I can make the proper decision at this time. 
It makes me so happy to hurt myself.
Well. I was doing so well, i was happy. I went nearly two months cut free. Last night, my girlfriend and i got into an argument and i was triggered. It felt so good to cut, and bleed. I want to do it again, and bleed even more this time... 

Hey everyone, this is my first post in this subreddit. If anybody needs to talk, you can send me a private message through my reddit account. I just made this account, so I'm not sure exactly how it works yet, so I think emailing would be easier but whatever is your preference. If you would rather email, then pm me and I will tell you my email. You can talk to me about anything, and I will always reply, although it may take a little while. Take care, loves!
Been battling my thyroid for the better part of a year now. Saw the Dr. today and my dosage has been increased quite a bit. It’s been frustrating to say the least to have something so out of my control. But I can’t and won’t give up. It’s a set back sure but there’s always hope. Hope that next month things will be better. Hope that I can still keep on moving forward and sooner or later things will work out. It can be hard to remember all the positive when i’m feeling a bit down but I just have to remind myself. I’m about to self publish my book on Amazon, my daughter is about to turn one, we’re going to be taking a trip soon. It’s a beautiful day and I have a purpose. I am needed. Nothing, not even my thyroid, can take that away from me. Remember the same  applies to you as well. Those that are struggling right now. There is always hope. Sometimes we can struggle to find it and need to be reminded. 
the good: I'm nearly 30, engaged to an amazing woman, employed in my field (even if not as well paid or relevant as I wish it was), fit, active, in a good situation, great family life, great relationship with the few friends I do have, and happy overall.The bad: When I get angry, upset, annoyed, or generally off kilter, I fall back to a habit from way back in middle school. I hit myself. usually on the head. I hit my head against walls or punch myself in the temple or back of the head. it upsets my fiancee, it upsets me, and i know it's not productive, but it feels in the moment like all I can do. I accepted a sentence of unsupervised probation for 4th degree assault recently, and the related mess has cost me tens of thousands of dollars and turned me into a hermit and spurred me to cut most of my former friends out of my life regardless of what they knew or thought about the situation.I don't know how to stop. I can and will delete this thread and account if it's not appropriate. But I need advice. I need strategies. I will be seeking counseling. I just need to know that someone understands and say "out loud" that I hurt myself and I don't like it.
Please do not tell me to lie about it or to be honest (or not make a big deal) about it with people. It's summer here. It's so hot that I am sweating lots so wearing long sleeves is often uncomfortable. I still have sometimes, or I've brought a cardigan when I know I'm going to be in an air conditioned building (but that's not always the case). My problem areas are my forearms. Cuts that go parallel along the arm. I can't cover them up with bracelets. Please help me out! What would you recommend? And if makeup, etc -- any specific brands or techniques?Thank you.
I've never seen stopping as a priority. I've been cutting for 5+ years now, and I know it makes the people who care about me upset, but that's the worst i've ever felt about doing it. I understand it's a horrible coping mechanism (I do it when I get just about any strong emotion), but each time I throw out my razors, about a month later I buy more. 
About 4 years ago I made the decision to really stop cutting. Actually make a solid, consistent effort. Since then I have cut a handful of times. The last time I did was probably a year or two ago. Throughout the past 4 years though, I feel like I've barely improved. I still think about it a lot, and it is still an immediate thought whenever I am stressed or have a bad day. Does this ever go away? Do I need therapy? I just don't understand. I wish the thoughts would ease up a little. I guess I've improved because I don't follow through with it, but some days I just really really want to.
The razor still has my dried blood from months ago on it. I want to cut a bit. It's how I cope.edit: relapsed after months, all is under control again.edit 2: ok now it's over for sure, it was shit.
I threw away my blades today.. I feel ready to quit but scared too and even though it's only been a few hours I'm already thinking about it and wishing I didn't. My scars are so ugly.. It's strangely comforting and something I've gone to for 9 or 10 years. I don't really know who I'll be without it. I just wanted to put it out there cause I figure telling people will help me be accountable. Any tips and tricks for the upcoming days of trying to quit would be greatly appreciated. 
Hello. I started harming myself around the age of 10, however, I started to cut myself around the age of 12. I am 18 now. Most of my self harm scars are on my wrists. I am very pale skinned and my scars are easily visible and some even change color when I am cold. I hate the way they look, and I feel like it's all people can see when I am wearing short sleeves. I usually cover it with makeup/band-aids (if it is recent) but I still feel like they are extremely visible. That just might be me, though. I look at other girls and how pretty they are, how they don't even have to think about covering their arms. I feel so stupid and fucked up for having marks on my arm. They're like, perfect indicators that shout "THIS PERSON IS NOT NORMAL" and it makes me just feel so small, almost like a puddle. I worry what the friends I have think about it. I don't know if any of them of seen it but I figure they do, and it makes me feel so insecure. I feel fucking terrified wondering if they've noticed new ones show up and just know that I am fucked up and getting worse. Does anyone else feel like this?
u/TherapistWow0mI'm posting here because Ingenuinely don't know what to do. I spent last night in the hospital after slicing both inner forearms multiple times with a razor. Today there is obvious deep scratches, blood and it looks terrible. I have never cut before. My head is so confused. Tomorrow my wonderful kids come back to me after their weekend with dad. Monday I must return to work in the health care field. It is a heatwave here so I'm trying to figure out how to pass with long sleeves. Barring that....is there a plausible explanation for my 10 and 12 year old kids?? They are sure to see the marks at some time. I do cat rescue for feral cats - perhaps a bad night trapping and releasing?? I've had medical issues recently that include some sudden fainting. Fainting...through a glass door?? Wrestling with an out of control patient and falling through the glass door?? I want to be ok. I want to be better. But this...explaining, hiding....this seems insurmountable. Please offer thoughts?
I started self harming by punching walls and concrete and biting the inside of my mouth, eventually I ended up cutting but that hurt my parents to the point where I basically found other ways to self harm. Not stopping cutting all together but focusing more on other ways. Usually I would punch myself in the face till I would get a black eye but I hit so hard I drew blood and that scared me out of that.Now yesterday I ended up biting into the top of my hands and tore  away a good chunk of skin. That's not gonna happen again but I'm not looking forward finding the next way to hurt myself.I guess I would like to know if anyone else has just decided to up and bite themselves leaving a lasting wound.
Hey guys, so it's the middle of the summer here, and my work uniform is short sleeves.  I've got hundreds of scars all the way up my forearm.  I work in the emergency room, and work 12 hour shifts right next to the social worker who has admitted me twice, and done crisis evals with me 5 or 6 times.  Yep, super awkward.  I would usually just wear a jacket with my uniform, but it's over 100 degrees outside every day, and that's very uncomfortable (not to mention it probably looks pretty suspicious to the rest of the ER staff).  I could also wrap my arm, which I do at home, but that's suspicious as well.  I'd like to try using full coverage makeup on my arm to de if that will help me keep them covered without looking suspicious.  What are some good brands and products.  I'm looking for tattoo-covering/fullest coverage types of things.  Any input is appreciated.  Thanks!
Suppose a patient is taking antidepressants for a reason other than treating major depressive disorder. If the patient is supposed to have a major depressive episode, the patient instead doesn't because the patient is already on antidepressants.So practically, it does not matter much assuming the patient does not go into a major depressive episode despite several incidents of dysphoria because antidepressants is kind of already the treatment for major depressive disorder.The above is my limited layman understanding. The following question is based on the above.**Is there a kind of way a doctor can diagnose a patient with major depressive disorder** or something like probable MDD if patient goes off antidepressants based on several episodes of dysphoria WHILE ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS for the purpose of transferring medical records when, for example, the patient moves to another country?The context of asking is my own experience which while I don't mind saying, I don't want to say because I'm posting this on several subreddits, some of which have problems with medical advice asking.Edit: What do you think about [mood disorder not otherwise specified](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/4u6xax/rules_of_diagnosing_depression_when_patient_is/d5ndaz9)?
i feel like i cant be strong anymore and just feel like cutting till there is no more blood
Hello. I am 17. I have struggled with self harm since I was 11. And eating disorders since I don't know really but maybe it started around the same time I suppose. I also have depression and anxiety. My depression has been very bad for a while now, only gradually getting worse. It was for a while that I would not realize I was not ok because I was only slowly getting worse. I was slowly adding little rules about my eating here and there and restricting some meals. And then eventually I had to admit I was not ok. And I'm not sure how everything got so bad again really. And then I started self harming again, about 6 months ago on and off. It would be me in school and something would happen where I'd fail at something (I go to a high pressure arts school) and I'd go to the bathroom and stab myself with pens. And that's what I've been doing. Just stabbing myself with pens and punching myself and lots of bruises. I haven't actually cut or burned though which is what I used to do. But although I've kept that under control sort of (only because the bruises are hard to hide and take a LONG time to heal really) my eating issues are bad. And depression is bad. And frankly I don't think I care anymore. I just don't feel like trying anymore. I don't want to keep trying to be ok and keep fighting to stay ok because I have to admit that I am not. And that I can't do this anymore. I just have already pretty much fully given up on trying to control my eating issues, and honestly right now I don't care. But the thing is I'm getting to a point where I'm going to give up trying to not self harm. And that kind of scares me. And I think that might only be because I will get in trouble if I do. I don't know what to do. 
I recently began to self harm again and I am so disappointed with myself. I promised myself "never again" but here I am. I want to stop, but I can't seem to stop for very long periods of time.When I first began, around 12, I tried cutting, but it didn't really offer the release I was looking for. I didn't get the idea to burn myself until I saw an older kid press the hot metal of a lighter into his hand, as like trick to impress his friends or something, I don't know.I'm 19 now, so I've been doing that for a long time. Small burn marks are easier to hide than cuts, and I didn't, and still don't want anyone to know.The burning of hot metal pressed into my skin is...almost orgasmic. It feels really good to me, but in a way I know it shouldn't.I want to stop, but I've been using it as a coping method to release my pent up frustration and anger and sadness and to kick start feelings of sensation and being real and being here.I have no where to turn, no one to talk to, and I don't want professional help. I feel like I am at a dead end and I will do this forever until I die, but I don't want to.
A lot of my friends and family thought I stopped cutting a couple years ago. So, I really haven't been able to celebrate or tell anyone that I've finally made it a whole year. So I posted it here. It feels good to share it. Though, I definitely feel like an addict. Some days I'm fine, while others the urge will just hit you and the only thing holding me back from relapsing is the thought that I'd be back at square one. Does anyone know any support groups, like AA, but for self harmers? 
I got introduced to cutting when i was 13. my best friend used to cut herself to relieve herself from the pain she hid within herself . upset that being friends with her for more than 6 years i couldn't help( couldn't help because she told me she had to deal with her broken heart herself. i tried. hell i tried. ), i cut myself in anger just to know why and how it feels. and i liked it. stupid i know. but from then on i haven't been able to stop myself. it felt so good. the blood. the pain. the swelling of the newly cut skin. everytime i got remotely upset i would run for the piece of glass so sharp. when my scars increased i started covering myself with full length clothes. in the recent years i have reduced. came out a depressing relationship. I've recovered. but sometimes i feel the ground slipping under me. i just cannot help myself. after 3 years ive started again. i stop myself i really try. but sometimes the emotions are too much to handle. logic overrides it. i really try. recent scars have gone deep. i need stitches for the last one. ive stopped for now. but so much mental pressure is building up. I'm scared and i really don't want to cut anymore. but sometimes its just hard to not think of it. 
Cut myself on my left wrist Saturday ... My relationship has been going downhill, plus work and money have me so stressed out. I guess that compelled me to... So stupid. I work in a nursing home as a housekeeper and our tops are short sleeved so I need to know the best way to hide them. I am terrified someone would see and get me fired or hospitalized. I need my job and regret what I did. All this added stress from doing this is ruining me further. This probably isn't the right place to post this. I'm sorry. I need help. 
I've been doing this since I was about 12 and now I'm 21. Sometimes I go days, months, or even a year where I don't hit my self. I don't ever hit myself in public only when I am alone. I have instances where I get really angry or really sad and I start hitting my head. Sometimes I hit myself as a sort of punishment to myself if I have done something bad or if I just completely rage out and can't control my emotions; alternatively when I am really sad and think it's all my fault. It's escalated over the years from just my hand to a hard covered textbook and even walls. I hit myself because I don't want to hurt other's but I can hit myself with no problem.I am a highly functioning individual. I go to college and am nearly done with my GED courses and lower division classes to wards my major. However, it's only when my emotions are on the opposite sides of the spectrum, in which I'm extremely angry or sad is when I begin to hit my head.
The last time I cut I had given up on quitting. I said, "There's no way I'll ever stop". I was in a psych hospital and surrounded by doctors and therapists and they doped me up for a while and then my friends made me not cut and then after a while I had gone so long without cutting that I stopped feeling addicted to it. And here I am, not having cut for four years.I know the feeling that it's impossible to stop, I know that place that just gives up. But please know that it IS possible.
I'm afraid. I feel so much shame.  I'm not performing up to standards at work and work is my life. Without it I lack purpose.  That purpose is the only reason I made it through the lifetime of abuse and mental illness.  I've been missing my medication. I'll never be good enough, never be normal.  Right now I want to cut myself and drink until I'm senseless. Until I can't feel anything inside. I can't stop crying.  I've been dating someone for almost 4 weeks but they are neurologically typical and I don't know what to do.  I feel like I should tell them so they can gtfo now because I'm crazy and they have only seen the upbeat side of me. I feel like I'm lying by not sharing how awful I feel right now.

Title speaks for itself. Some stuff's been happening in my personal life involving my best friend. I won't say what, but it's been stressing me a bit. It got so bad, that yesterday, I cried for a solid 10 minutes. I don't feel exactly well right now.
Okay so me and my boyfriend been dating for maybe 5 months now. And it has been going flawless, but his "best friend" has liked me, and he knows this. While I am uncomfortable around his friend which i'll call his friend josh, and my boyfriend Jay. I deal with Jay's friend because hes my boyfriend, and I think he deserves to be with his friends as well not just me. But recently, Josh has been making sexual comments, and I just usually ignore it. But last week Josh has been trying to touch me sexually, Josh groped me, smacks my ass, And last week as well he started groping me. I told him no, very clearly not once did I say its Okay. So I got scared he threatened me if I was to tell Jay he'd ruin our relationship. So I told Jay ahead of time, (Two days after) And keep in mind I was crying and not talking to Jay for those two days, I tried to tell my parents but there always busy with work so I was kinda on my own. Well today I told Jay. And Jay said imma liar, and how Josh wouldn't do that. And it just broke my heart how he'd take josh's side, and then he said im a cheater and how im trying to seperate them because I hate josh. But its not true so I stopped talking to Jay, and just sobbed really hard. And I just found out he cut himself really deep, because of me. And I feel like its my fault. He threatened to Over dose if I don't leave him alone, and I just don't know what to do. Hes never been this dramatic before. Im just feeling really numb and in shock, and I have no idea how to talk to him about any of this. Thank you, any help is appreciated..
Hi all,I have been practicing a very powerful Qi Gong practice that has healed me from various ailments I once had including depression, social anxiety and low energy levels. It's truly amazing and totally free. If anyone would like to try it for themselves you can find it here:1.)A book on first hand accounts of dramatic health improvements from practicing Falun Dafa. These health improvements are both mental and physical with many people having being cured from a variety of conditions and diseases:http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2005/4/3/59184.html2.)Actual practice:www.falundafa.orgI hope this can help and heal others as much as it has healed me.
That's it, I've made it to 108 days, and it doesn't even have that merit, most of the days I was just way too tired to cut myself, like last night. I just don't see any reasons at all to not cut again, it makes me feel better for 3 or 4 days when I do it, and I miss that feeling. I can't deal with this loneliness anymore, it's just too much, I haven't talked more than a yes or no with anyone since months ago or even years if it's about how I am.

Lately, I have developed a habit of hitting my forehead with my palm when I get frustrated with other people—or when I get frustrated with myself.Yesterday, after an argument with my partner, I hit the top of my head with my knuckles multiple times so hard that I got a major headache that I can still feel today.I don't feel I can talk to anyone about it. I'm afraid of what they will think about me. I have tried mentioning it to my partner but the response was not very caring, only "Don't hit yourself!".I know that this is what I should do: Stop harming myself and transform/channel my frustrations in different ways... but it's easier said than done. First step is maybe to tell you guys about it here.
I'm having an anxiety attack and breathing pretty difficult. I'm trying to manage but I'm having all these negative thoughts that are making it worse and making me want to cut. Can anybody give me some courage or try and help me shake the negativity with some uplifting comments?
I really do. But every time I feel too much or too little or sometimes for no good reason, I get that little voice in the back of my head and I have a really strong urge to grab my razor. I don't know what to do anymore really
I feel like theres all this pent up pressure in my head. I want to cut to release it. I got blades today. Something I haven't had in two months but now there right next to me. I'm scared to move on and I hate being where I am. I have school next month a job starting next week. I've been practicing my healthy habits but I'm scared to move on. I really need someone to talk too
This is a throwaway account, obviously. But I just wanted to tell someone besides my one friend who listens. Earlier this night (morning?), I was holding a dull pair of safety scissors that I use because I cannot trust myself. The next thing i know, I'm bleeding profusely from a cut on my arm. It took 25 minutes of constant pressure to stop bleeding. And now I'm sitting here, waiting for morning, unable to sleep, because I know the second my mom sees it I might as well be in hell. I don't even remember wanting to cut, or even actively thinking about it. I don't even remember bringing the blade to my wrist! And yet, the evidence is there. Is my memory lapse something to be worried about? It's been happening more frequently and I'm really scared because, what if I go way too deep and I come back to reality bleeding to death? I was a few months clean, and now it's gone. I feel like crap. Does anyone even care? I don't. 
Okay, so I've been self harming on and off since I was about 9 years old (I'm 19 now), at first it was for the reasons most people self harm, to deal with frustration, sadness etc. but at the age of about 16-17 I started noticing not only was I self harming for the emotional release but because I actually liked the aesthetic to put it bluntly of blood being all over myself, then I started unsuccessfully trying to give myself black eyes and face injuries and bruises cause I liked the idea of it.When I had to get stitches the first time I loved them, and though I didn't show anyone except people closest to me I wanted to show everyone.Now I'm 19 and I hadn't been self harming for nearly a year, but the other night in a drunken fit of edgy rage I was listening to angsty music and I thought that having blood all over my hands would be a good idea, so I sliced my wrists...unfortunately my drunken misjudgment caused me to cut extremely deep on one arm and I had to get 4 stitches...I wasn't worried at first cause I told myself I never wanted to do it again due to fact the scars on my arm from all the times I've self harmed infuriate me every time I look at them. But I'm afraid because as I was getting the stitches and now having the stitches I sorta felt/feel happy I have them like I love the look of them and it's concerning how much I enjoy having stitches cause I'm scared that I'm going to keep self harming so I can get stitches, or "accidentally-on purpose" causing myself harm just cause I like, stitches and bruises and trips to the hospital so much Does anyone feel this way to, and if so what do you do to avoid it? I'm scared cause the reasoning is so blurry and strange and hard to explain. I'm scared of myself! 
Nothing unusual, teenager stuff, girl I have feelings for doesn't have feelings for me. That's okay, not mad at her, still friends I hope. Thing is, I got sad, okay? I wanted to cry, I was that sad. But I couldn't, you know? So I decided to cut. I cut deeper than I ever have. I told myself it would only be this one time. But what if it isn't? I liked it, it made me feel better. Now, I know full well why it isn't good and all that stuff, no need to tell me. I'm just kinda scared that I may decide to do it again.
Now she has been doing this for a few years if thats what i've heard correctly. And she doesn't just say it, I've seen it. Just last night I cut myself, Or self harmed. w.e. And she ended up crying to my displeasure. And she cut herself tonight which was again, Plenty of hours away from when I did it. I don't know if she did it cus of me or not. And I feel like she thinks I don't care. I do I just don't know how to react. When I first learned about her habits I use to bawl my eyes out, but I just gave up. I tried hard, and im not good at emotional support. But im trying. I have self harmed for years now, but I keep it under control. She has major depression, social anxiety etc. And she always says shes ugly, but she is really beautiful, and I always tell her I love her, and how gorgeous she is. She makes fun of me, but I never take it seriously, its more for laughs, and keep in mind. I am far from attractive, im pretty nerdy long hair, and shes just amazing. And I have known her for about a year now. I just need help as of what to do. It was about two hours ago she cut herself from when this post was sumbitted. I did my self harm the night before.  and I didn't know what to do or say, I was so quiet, and then when I tried talking to her about it. She said she wouldn't tell me for now on cus I said I hate dealing with it. I shouldn't have said that but it came out. For the first time I cried my eyes out in awhile. she didn't hear me cus I left. But I just feel like I messed up, 1 : I wanna know how to say sorry to her. 2 : I need'a know when she does that. 3 : What do I say to her when she does cut herself. and also She has urges to cut herself as she explaines it. and she can't help it, she is on medication. has been to hospitals, and is seeing help. Im sorry if it sounds like im rambling, im tired and im typing this really late at night. and if you've seen My other posts, she is the same girl (My ex) that we ended for awhile. The title just describes her talking and not being over her ex. I don't wanna hear to end it or anything. Ty!
I don't know anything anymore. I didn't cut for weeks, then I started about 3 days ago and now I can't stop myself anymore. I had a really bad nosebleed yesterday and another one today. Because of them, I didn't cut myself like I usually do, but I know as soon as I go to bed in a few minutes, I'll just do it again. I try not to, I told my friend about it and he really tries to help, and he has. He isn't here all the time though. I can't even focus long enough to write this post.
Dear thyroid, I don’t think I like you anymore. You’re all over the place and can’t seem to make up your mind. While your busy doing that i’m over here struggling to make sure i’m doing everything in my power to be healthy and not lose hope. It’s draining to see my efforts having no effect and it’s annoying not being in control. This battle make’s me want to relapse and harm myself again. It makes me want to be able to have control over something and since I can’t control my weight despite my best efforts I can control the pain and marks on my body. But I won’t. I know that at the end of the day it wont fix anything and I know that I just have to have patience. This will work itself out and I just have to keep moving forward. But just so you know you may have won the battle but you won’t win the war. I’m going to keep going and trying no matter what you throw my way. Don’t get cocky and think that if I have a bad day where I get upset that it means you’ve won. Because trust me, you haven’t.
Today I went to see a new counselor and all she did was insulte and berate me. She insulted selfharmers saying only kids do that. She went on to say that she was better than me, showing her accomplishments. She said she could help me but did not give any advice or help. Its like I did something to her.Now I don't know what to do. I was really hoping for help to move on and get better. I thought I was doing the right thing seeking help but apparently not. I really am lost and frustrated now
Nearly a month clean, all gone in the decision of a few seconds that I don't even remember. Then I was left in the aftermath. How am I supposed to be strong again when I can't even make it a month.
Been having some intrusive thoughts lately and could really use some positive encouragement to help keep them at bay. 
I'm not addicted to the pain but the blood ... I need to see blood flow.  I'm having nightmares of blood and hurting myself. It's just too much and I'm losing my mind.
I'm realizing everything was better when I cut. I miss my ex. I miss being happy I broke a glass today and am thinking of trying to get my life back
for the past few days i feel like no matter what i do i manage to screw things up. I feel like  a bother and annoyance to people. i feel alone.
I've felt for about 3 months very much that I'm not real.  Cutting used to help but I'm pretty much done with cutting. Lifting weights brings me back for a short period. I know a bunch of grounding techniques but they don't help with the persistent feelings.  I want to feel better =(
I have recently picked up the habit of cutting again. I currently have 25+ fresh scars on my legs and arms. Is there any other mtehods anyone here has found helpful? 
I never feel enough. That's why I have all theses problems I try so so hard with everything and I do these things to myself because it all gets too much and next thing I know I can't take it but that's not enough. I'm not even going to sugar coat it. I've hated everything about myself starting in 4th grade I was running 30 mins everyday to lose weight because my mom said I needed to because I was getting stretch marks. Eventually In 5-6th I had to stop eating dinners and start cutting down my food intake but it didn't work so I started all theses diet plans and none of them worked. I started taking these huge weight loss pills, I even had to take them during school; telling people it was "vitamins" I had to quit this diet plan thing too because I didn't want to eat and I was feeling fat. My mom didn't like all the food options so she wanted to quit too. Now I'm on a strict frozen food diet. I have stretch marks everywhere and I hate wearing shorts. Id rather wear jeans in 100 degree wether if I could. People make fun of me because of my weight because you look at my sister and she blonde, tan, thin, athletic, and fit. You look at me and I'm the opposite. Everybody expects me to look like my sister. I'm not. I hate being by her because people judge me. I'm the oddball in my family. They are all sporty and athletic and I'm not. I'm me. I don't fit in my own family. I wear baggy jackets and long boot cut pants because they cover me and I don't feel totally insecure. I hate myself so much. I have creams and lotions, whiting toothpaste, weight loss pills, face masks, stretch mark cream. I do it all but nothing works. Now my mom is mad at me because I don't want to run three miles on the high school track with my brother. I can't run. They all just made fun of me for it. That's why I can't take compliments either because I can't live up to what they think. I'm never what they think. Yes I give up easy because sometimes I feel like it's easier than letting them down. I just want to sit in my room and not have to worry about other people and then my mom comes and tells me I'm too pale because I never go outside. I'm never good enough. No matter how damn hard I try. I'm always the last option. I am overweight. I am quiet. I do have some anxiety. I do self harm. I do cry. I do have feelings. I do hear you. I do know your comparing me. I do know I could be better. I know, okay. I know. I try my absolute best with everything and it causes me to have melt downs. I'm a straight A student, I'm always on time, I'm always smiling, I'm always trying to be perfection even though I know I'm not. I put to much pressure on myself added with other people's pressure. My mind is overthinking everything. My eyes won't stop crying. My sobs are getting louder and louder. I'm gripping my thighs so tight I'm sure to have bruises. My fists, my arms, my thighs, my body burns to feel pain and pressure. I'm having an anxiety attack. I know where my 'weapons' are but I trying not to. Even though I feel I need to. I'm stuck in my room fan turned on high shaking and crying. Please help me. I cant do this again. Please.
So I have my last final exam tomorrow and last night I fucked my arm up pretty bad. So any tips on how to hide my arm at school tomorrow? Makeup's out, as is long sleeves (I have a uniform) so any tips that aren't either of those on how to make sure no one notices?
It all happened this Thursday at ~1:30 am. I was lying in bed when suddenly all of the shit that has happened to me over the year took the upper hand. I reached over to the table right next to my bed and cut myself for the first time. It was a feeling of freedom and my heart was beating like crazy. After the first cut I felt the immense adrenaline rush and I just couldnt stop, it was like I was under the influence of some kind of f****** drug. After the fifth cut I had a breakdown and cried myself to sleep like the pathetic piece of sh** that I am just to wake up with a bloodstain on my shirt. The feeling of having to go to school made me want to kill myself. I've always been nervous at school, but it was even worse that day. Altough it was 30°C here in Germany, I walked around in a long sleeved shirt and a jacket which made me feel like a jackass. Then before the last period I just couldnt hold back again. I went to the bathroom and bashed my arm until I couldn't feel it anymore. Then Wednesday came and I had to go to physiotherapie. Before that I cut myself again, but it was only one cut because I heard my mom come upstairs and had I had to throw the knife away. Right now I feel the need to do it again, so I try to let out my anger in another way, and this seemed like the right place. A good friend of mine lost to much blood while cutting herself and she had to go to the hospital and I can remember her telling me to never start cutting. I never felt as ashamed of myself as I do now.I'm sorry.
I was raped as a child and I've been working through it but after being groped at a concert recently I feel I've broken completely. Like I only now realize the reality that to most people I'm a piece of meat to be taken and shared, not a human being. And I feel there's nothing I can do. I can't do shit without feeling like someone is thinking of a hundred ways to fuck me. I feel like no one respects me at work because I am young and female. I never know if my accomplishments are genuine and I feel like it's only a matter of time before I am raped again. And throughout all this, the voice in my head is saying *shh, it's okay, you're okay, come on, don't you wanna be a good girl? Be a big girl and tell me you're okay*Over and over and over and over and over and over and over. I know cutting will make it stop. I want to sew up my pussy and chop off my breasts. I hate myself and I hate what I am and I hate knowing that this is my reality and I should just accept it. I want to cut so, so bad. I'm about to leave work. I live by myself. I could do it if I wanted to, just like old times. Really the only thing that's stopping me is I know if I do my boyfriend will probably tell my parents. He already almost did when I told him I wanted to. I told him that wasn't necessary so he's going to come over and be with me but he won't for a few hours. He wants to wait for traffic to die down first. So until then... Hopefully my resolve remains, but it's getting harder and harder to remember what's so bad about cutting? It helps me. It keeps me sane. It makes his voice stop. What's bad about that?
29/F. I recently got a job (for the first time in years) as a caregiver and I also help out with my grandparents who have Alzheimer's. I have six people under my responsibility and doing everything they tell me to do is killing me inside. The worst part is I get paid in December.I want to move out of my parent's house but I can't because I don't even have a hole to drop dead in. So I've been focusing on work. I envy my younger sister because she already has a place of her own. I see the people that I take care of talking about their lives, their children's lives, etc and it just depresses me. It makes me feel like I'll never have a life of my own or even a little place I can call mine. So I self harm. It makes me feel so much better about myself. Eventually we all die, so why not? I can't kill myself because who's gonna take care of my grandparents and parents then? When am I gonna have a life of my own? I really don't care now... my life doesn't matter and it doesn't belong to me but to my family. So I can cut as many times as I damn well please. At least I'll have that going for me. And it's a damn good replacement for having no dreams.
She was the only person I had that I could talk to about any of this, but now she won't talk to me anymore. I don't know what to do and I'm worried I'm gonna keep cutting.I just don't know what else to do to get a release.
Hey guys, so I work in an emergency room, and have had a major self harming addiction for the last few months (I'm talking 15-20 new cuts a day).  I was recently pink slipped (forced by the police to be admitted into a behavioral unit), and was brought to the exact ER that I work in, so a lot of my coworker's saw me, and are aware that I have serious mental health issues going on. This makes work super difficult at times, especially because I have so many cuts on my arms/hands, and because I have so much interaction with both staff and patients.  Do you guys have any advice to help me keep on the down low with my cuts and scars so that I'm not pulled aside and at risk of being admitted while I'm at work?  I'm going to 9 hours of group therapy a week and working on my addiction, but I have a long battle ahead of me, and my job is pretty much my only distraction.  Sorry this sounds like a jumbled mess, but I'm really worried, and people have started catching on.  Please help.
Please.
I'm really worried because I have work in 2 days. I started yesterday with scratching my arms and today it quickly escalated with cutting. My parents haven't noticed. I'm in such a bad place right now with everything. 


21yr/Male. I have been somewhat clean for 5 years. I have had small relapses that last a day or 2 and are not as severe as they were 5 years ago. 5 years ago I got drunk in the woods, cutting open my upper arms and thighs. I passed out but then woke up 3 hours later. I walked home and sewed it up myself. My self harm then and now (again it is very minor now when I do relapse) consisted of cutting my arms, chest, and legs. Punching walls and trees which would leave cuts and bruises, Punching myself till that body part was numb, sex and/or masturbation until the skin was ripped and bleeding. I have been with my high school sweetheart for the past 5 years and we are getting married in October. She got me to stop. We moved in together last year. I have major anxiety issues along with major bipolar depression. So yeah. That's that.
I never had a huge problem. I never cut deep enough to scar bad. But I was an idiot today. And I want to cause myself some pain again. So I feel it burn under my clothes for a week afterwards. Because that is what it feels like I deserve. I've proven all the people right who said I'd never get my shit together. They've known since I was a child I'd be a fuck up. Back then I blamed them for giving up on me. I thought they were abusive. But all they were was right. 
I bruised myself today which I guess is better then cutting myself. I just feel so depressed today and I need help because I feel I'm slipping back. I went to enroll back in school after not going for a year. I thought I would be strong enough to go back but now I don't know. The thought of going back to being around a lot of people is terrifying me. The anxiety of paying for it.  I set appointment with therapist for end of month but I don't know. I just feel everywhere I go I will never belong because everywhere I have gone I've never fit in. I'm tired of being alone. I miss smoking pot to cope with my loneliness it really REALLY helped
I quit almost 3 years ago and have been successful on the whole (a few hiccups are normal), but I'm afraid cutting/burning will always seem like a viable option to me. Once you get used to it, it's like it's permanently added to your toolbox of coping mechanisms. It's really not realistic for me now that I'm in my 20's; it would pose too much of a threat to the life I'm trying to make for myself. I truly believe it's possible to recover fully, but I hope that eventually I stop thinking about it. I guess it occupies my mind less than it used to, but every time I get depressed, the urges surface again and I have to smack them down. It's like playing a terrible game of whack-a-mole. I don't think I was ever addicted, but damn, it stays with you. Do not start. If you've only done it once or twice, find healthier coping mechanisms, or at least more relatable ones. This is a weight I have to drag around with me that none of my friends understand or know how to talk about. 
(15/f)i started cutting when i started being bullied.
Hi,I'm 17 MtF trans with gender dysphoria, anxiety and OCD as well as the usuals: thoughts about killing myself and self-harm.I'm terrified of giving in to urges to cut, because on a logical level I know this is not what I want, but on an emotional level I like everything about it; the idea of pain, even the addiction.I should add that I have self-harmed in the past but never in a way that left scars.What can I do to stop thinking about all this? I don't need more issues than I have already.
I hosted a blood drive today. It was fairly easy and not as hard as I though it would be. Our everyday lives can feel so overwhelming and mundane, like we don’t belong or make a difference. But today I helped save up to 93 lives just by hosting a blood drive. You might not think anything you do can or will make a difference but something as simple as donating blood  can save up to three people. I know that when things are going bad it helps to be able to give back, it makes me feel better. Just wanted to share to remind you that yes you are important and that you are worth something. 
Its been, I dont know, 7 months since I last cut myself, but every now and then I feel like doing it again. Its the only way I can let my emotions out, to feel safe even. Its almost like being hugged real tight.Im lonely and I keep dreaming about her. I want to be good and take care of myself, but it just seems pointless. I feel pathetic.
Feel welcome to AMA about this.
I just need to tell someone. 4 years of not doing anything, then one really bad night was all it took. The self loathing is strong in this one.
Hi /r/StopSelfHarm. I am a trainee clinical psychologist undertaking research in relation to thoughts of suicide. The study is also concerned with how people that self-harm experience thoughts of suicide. I am hoping to recruit people that have **and** have not struggled with thoughts of suicide, so anyone can participate. I have received permission from a moderator of the forum to post a link to my study. It is a questionnaire that takes approx 10-15 minutes to complete. The study is entirely anonymous and a draw for one of four £25 ($36) Amazon vouchers will be made for those that take part.I would really appreciate your participation and thank you advance to those that take part. The link is below:http://tinyurl.com/h3glqwg
So I cut my wrist pretty badly today. It may have been a suicide attempt, I'm not sure. I don't think so I think I just wanted to punish myself. Anyway, now I have these three really big red marks on my arm. I don't know how sterile the knife was, but I'm going to try to clean them. They're still very visible though, not little at all. I don't want to scare anyone. Something I noticed: I rarely self harm while calm. Usually when I stop panicking or whatever I lose the urgency to hurt/kill myself. Easier said than done I know, but I try to take a few hours and some deep breaths before I try something. Failed today though.
just how you stop self harm? I mean, I only cut when I'm depressed, which this time is almost a month. but I cut multiple times a day. when I see healing, I cut more

I was clean from self harm for over three years. I just started again recently and I feel so ashamed, like I'm a freak. But it's my only way to cope with the feelings of worthlessness and self loathing that overwhelm me
This is the longest I have gone since I started self-harming when I was 12 years old.It has been a long road. Some days are worse than others, but as the time has passed... those days come less frequently. Learning to deal with (and accept) my feelings for what they are has been my biggest aid in this journey, as well as my amazing boyfriend who gets me and loves me in a way I have never been gotten or loved before... and my awesome best friend who fully understands the struggle. Therapy has helped. Cutting ties with everyone who was toxic for me, too. I've learned a lot about myself in the past 2 years. And one thing is how to begin to have compassion for myself, instead of hate on and hurt myself. So far... so good. Even when it's not.I just wanted to post this somewhere. I'm really proud of myself. I do miss it sometimes. And sometimes I still want to do it, but I haven't. I hope I never do again. If I were to do it again, it would stunt me emotionally once again and I don't need that. My feelings are valid and need to be let out and felt. I deserve that much.I wish you all the best. Not leaving this sub because I would like to talk to others in need sometimes.
I've had a few instances in my life where when I get very stressed and I cannot respond or control a situation I self destruct and start hurting myself. The first time I ever commited any form of self harm was in middle school. I was stuck in detention and very upset at myself. I blamed myself and punched my face till my nose was bloody. It wasn't until the last couple of years from say 18-21  that my self harm problem has come back. When I'm very stressed to the point of wanting to explode. I sometimes start hitting my skull.My girlfriend has tried to help me. She's told me I could kill myself if I kept doing this. I haven't done it recently. I'm very worried I've caused brain Damage due to this problem or something else.Another part is anger. Along with frustration Anger causes it too. I oftentimes have thoughts of smashing people  I'm mad at. I've never acted on something like this in years. Beyond school yard fights. It worries me because I get very angry at my girlfriend when we argue. All I can think about is hurting her. I don't think I've ever been able to diffuse a argument other then by shutting up about something. All this stress and arguing leads me  to wanting to bash my brains in.  I haven't been to a Doctor in years. I recently obtained state healthcare, but I'm unable to visit the doctor as I work a lot and I rely on her parents to drive us places. I'm currently saving up for a car. She wants me to see a doctor not only for my physical but my mental health.Thanks for reading.

So it doesnt seem bad, i took a lead pencil (0.5mm) and started scratching the surface of my skin repeatedly until it bled, a couple of times to my skin on my wrist, and now it looks ugly, it's been a day and there are bumpy scars and lines, how do you remove them?
I used to selfharm daily and ever sense my last inpatient it really has decreased. The urges are there but fading more and more. I find myself being very lonely even when surrounded by people. I do enjoy talking to certain people one on one but I'm not a good conversation so I just listen usually which makes me feel bad that I can't talk well . Some people I just get so excited to see I'm like a dog when I see them lol. for the most part though I'm just lonely. I keep thinking once I kick all bad habits someone special will come in my life like a divine gift but I feel I wont be strong enough till I meet htat special person. its a conundrum.I'm only doing things in life to make myself more lonely and complaining about being lonely
I've been so stressed lately with work and home life. I know I've been a bummer but I can't believe my own best friend would bully me...I thought I wouldn't do it but I couldn't help it. I just wish someone would just hug me and tell me that I never have to feel so bad to hurt myself...
This board is called 'stopselfharm' but I'm still undecided as to whether I am motivated at the moment to actually stop. Nevertheless I recognise that I probably should stop. I've had struggles with depression (and anxiety) since I was pretty young and started self harming in my early teens, eventually stopped before I hit my 20s. Usually cutting, sometimes burning, scratching or hitting and even eating foods that I knew would make me ill/misusing medication. Also starved myself for a long while as a teen.Anyway my life circumstances are drastically different now but one old coping mechanism recently popped back up in my life, starting last November. I was raped last April and I think this contributed to it.  The past few weeks I selfharm almost every day, usually cutting, and it's escalating- more cuts, deeper cuts, cravings for more blood. I'm in my late 20s now and really can't afford to be messing around with this stuff- it could cost me my career. But I am increasingly reckless. And I don't know if I can stop because I haven't tried. I guess my big fear will be to get properly addicted again as I was before. Not sure what I want from people, just screaming into the void. 
Hi there- long time lurker, first time poster...which isn't really an  occasion, given the topic. I'll cut to the chase, then. I've had my own problems with self harm for a few years now. It stems from anxiety and depression, and if my time on here has taught me anything, that's an unfortunate continuity. I've always managed to stop self-harming on and off for a while before relapsing into doing it every day, like a cycle. Recently, I managed about two months and a half as the school year (high school, I should mention) came to a close. I was proud. This was the longest I had gone- maybe since I started.I've stopped burning completely and haven't since Spring Break, but I broke the self-harm tally board about a week ago. The weird thing was, essentially nothing made me- I felt like I had hit a breaking point. No one was around, and no one had said or done anything. Then daily life stresses started affecting me, as they do, being daily life stresses. I feel like I've lost control. I've found myself carrying around a razor, which I've tried throwing away only to either find a new one or find myself unable to. I already have to wear jackets in high heat from the old scars, and I was sort of getting confident going without any sleeves outside. I don't need new scars. I'm also scared that, once I start my summer job or once school picks back up again, this will continue. How do you continue after a relapse? Any tips on how to not dive back into the routine of cutting? And how do you prevent relapsing again, or at least extending the time before a relapse? This came out really long and rambling- sorry. Thank you for your time.
It has been 2.5 months since I last harmed myself. I am trying really, really hard not to. But this week has been stressful and I find myself constantly thinking about harming myself. I am also having trouble falling asleep at night and it is not helping.The stress is from a combination of work, school, family and friends. I feel overwhelmed by everything I have to do. I know this will sound weird, but part of the stress is from playing video games with my friends. I have friends that I play competitive games online with. But I have been busy with work and school and I can not play as much. I am no longer as good as them. Knowing that I am holding them back and they don't really want to play with me is really bothering me. Like really, really bothering me.I am hoping that things will calm down and the stress will go away. But right now I am unhappy and constantly feeling urges to harm myself. And I needed to talk about it.
Hi there, I am 27 and I used to self harm regularly. Now I haven't done it in months but I still get the urge to. And I don't get it.Realistically, it is not a cry for attention - I live abroad and alone and I don't have intimate friends who would worry about it - and I see a therapist. I have an ok job, I am not struggling too much to make rent etc. I never had the urge to take drugs or drink but when I feel terribly angry or frustrated, knowing that there is an achievable, immediate release is a powerful thing, if it makes sense.I started self harming when I was 15 or so, I lived in a abusive household. And I thought that 12 years later, having left so many years ago, I would kind of adjust to my life and deal better with my problems... and nope :-/Do you think the urge to SH is a permanent thing? That I will have to fight for years on end?  Anyone managed to get rid of it for years?
My main trauma is surrounding the military. I don't want to sound pathetic but this time of year is real hard for me. I'm staying positive but its hard when all you want to do is sleep
It's been about a month since I last self harmed, and the scars are still pretty visible. Today I went to play disc golf with some friends and actually wore a pair of fairly short shorts. It was so muggy and hot out that pants were just out of the question. The scars are a dark red and very visible, but I wore shorts anyway! And I didn't feel bad or self-conscious, feeling pretty good right now. :3
She's only 13 and she cuts. She sees a counselor, is on antidepressants, and I've removed any sharps from where she can get to them. But emotionally, I'm not sure how I can best help and support her. When I find new cuts I try to get her to talk to me about the emotions behind the cutting but she clams up. I was hoping someone who has been there might have advice on how I can help her.
I just wanted to thank you guys, I always lurked most nights but you stopped me for quite a few, you reminded me that people out there care and that it's not worth hurting myself over the bad people who don't. I'm very thankful and in 2 months I'll be a year clean. I also want to tell anyone that is self harming that I love ya and hope the best comes to you soon, life is one tricky mess after another and I think we all figure it out eventually, anyway, I'm gonna stop babbling, thanks again everyone!
Loneliness, sadness, regret?I don't want to deal with these feelings any more. I've started exercising, hanging out at the library/reading, I go to outpatient, hang out with my friends but its all still there.  
I'm so frustrated with myself. I've been through rehab and therapy and I have been a lot better than I was 4 years ago.. But here I am.. I keep looking at the veins in my arm and I just want to cut. Ugh. I'm hoping I can get some support and work through this without relapse. Because honestly 4 years is a pretty damn long streak and I'm so worried I'm going to snap and break it.
What's to do? I'm 22 years old/male and I have no friends, no girlfriend or anything. My family are very abusive (they make fun of the way I look, they told me I am loser even tho I am studying and have 3.87 GPA) and forced me to leave the house and live in my car for 6 months now and soon I have to hand back the car to my bank because I can't make payments. I am 3rd year in Computer science major and due to my social anxiety I couldn't keep even a part-time job. Previously, I had PTSD due to the stuff I saw back in my country(Iraq, I came in the US in 2008). It so hard for me because I have amblyopia and asymmetry in my face/head shape since birth(visual acuity 20/200 right eye and can not be correct with glass or surgery). I look weird or like junkie because it makes my right eyelid droppy. This is all hard for me because I have no friend and technically no family. People sometimes make fun of the way I look or make racist remarks. I struggle to find food and gas to get to my university. I have tried to suicide once by swallowing whole pack of baby aspirin and ended up in the hospital for about a week(3 years ago). Even during my time at the hospital, no one visited me or called me. I have no money now or anything.I question my existence everyday and most of the time I just want this shitty life of mine to end because I am so done with my childhood memories, the way people everywhere I go treat me like I am some kind of weirdo because of my eye and face, this loneliness and hopelessness. Sometimes I just want to be accepted or just die.
i have just been wearing long sleeved clothes but as it is getting a lot warmer i find it difficult to give reasons for wearing long sleeved stuff, any advice?
I have done a lot of personal research on self harm in the US since that's where I'm from and did all my self injury, and there is a lot of data out there on self harm in the US and UK particularly, where it is a fairly common phenomenon. However, I recently moved to an East Asian country and I'm really curious how common it is here. Does anyone know any resources or studies or even personal anecdotes about self harm in East Asian societies? Seems like it's more common in the West, but there are so many people here it seems statistically likely that it's going on a lot here, maybe it's just less talked about? Anyways, let me know your thoughts/experiences/findings, please!


I typically cut in privacy and hide it but sometimes when I've really screwed up a relationship I find myself contemplating cutting to get the attention off the bad thing I did. Am I the only one?
Things in my life have taken a turn for the worse and after months of stuggleing its really getting to me. I havent self harmed since christmas, a few days after or so, but now the desires growing in me again. Im a bit on the fence though, hence why Im writing here. Im always sort of semi trying to do better but then recently my boyfriend whos my main motivation and supporter said he cant deal with my issues anymore because theyre becoming too much and from that moment a deep desire to cut myself started. At the same time i dont want to. Since I ant write to him anymore I thought id write here. I feel extremely conflicted as to whats right or not. 
I find myself in a total unescapable situation, every day/ time it's gets worse and worse, I can't talk to anyone, I would kill myself but I don't have the guts to do it/ people would be upset, so I'm left alone with no end in sight, why should I let other people stop me from doing the one thing that could save me ?

I've been very depressed with daily anxiety attacks for almost two months been receiving professional help. I started self harming 3 days ago. Im just at a very dark place and could use someone to talk to if its no trouble.Edit: it makes more sense now
I'm not usually a cutter so I probably don't even deserve a comment, but for those of you who are unfortunate enough to stumble upon this:-Ice is great but cant usually get to it when I need to-Rubber bands, novelty has worn off, I just end up punching/slapping my arm or breaking the rubber band-Digging underneath my fingernails with paperclips is making it hard to type, this is required for my job, I type 8-12 hours a day some days (They say if you can stand the pain, you're a masochist; I can't stand the pain for more than a few seconds but I do cause lasting damage which I think is not the idea, idk)SO what else can I do? Is it really considered that harmful to punch my leg? It hurts, often all day, and if I hit hard enough I have trouble walking which reminds me all day that I deserve to suffer and not to blame anyone but myself for my problems. If I resist my urges long enough, I go for my head. Every time. Usually with fists but I have used everything short of a knife to try and knock myself out. So I need something before I crack my skull open. Like, not this second. Something I can use to avoid hitting my head.
I am way behind in schoolwork and stuff, and I can barely get anything done due to anxiety and depression. When I think about school i have such apprehension and I have to cut to feel better about starting work. I feel like it takes the edge off and I feel in control, but it doesn't last for long and my work gets behind again. I focus on my work for about a day and then I think about hurting myself again just to get through it.


I cant get to ice cubes. I cant cut though I usually dont. I want to hurt myself and I want to hurt myself permamently. I am so ashamed of myself and I so far havent even hit myself. I started to burn myself with acigartete but im not alone so it was difficult and so i stopped. I need something I need to be punished. I am scum , I made a mistake and the lowest scumbag asshole I know made me feel lower than he is. I am what is wrong with everyone evil pours from my skin and I need to cut it off of me and bleed to death. What do I do so I can punish myself without taking it too far because I really want to put myself into a wood chipper right now.

I'm having a really rough night and I'm afraid that I'm going to give into the urge. None of my friends are available to chat which is my usual method of distraction, and I'm running out of ways to keep myself busy and successfully distract myself. If anyone is around to talk I would really appreciate a bit of company.
I made it 35 days without cutting! However, I cut three days ago and then again last night. I am going through a breakup as well. My girlfriend got back together with her ex boyfriend, without telling me, about three weeks ago. We were going to prom together and she thought that I would still want to go as her second date with her boyfriend. I really should have ended the friendship there, but I am pathetic and and I am still friends with her to this day.However, I don't feel as if the breakup is influencing my desire to live in any way. We still talk daily, and have a great relationship because I forgave her. She has helped me through all of my self-harm, Tourette's Syndrome related problems, depression, anxiety, and she has even helped boost my shitty self-confidence. If anything, she is one of the only things keeping me from killing myself. Well, her, and my twin brother, who I know will be devastated if I die. I just love her so much and she may feel the same for me, but it is not enough for her to want to be with me.I talked to my ex some more and she told me not to feel sorry about the problems I caused last night. The problem was that I decided that it would be a good idea to cut and to break my 35 day clean streak before I left to hang out with my friends. Because I was feeling so bad and I didn't want to ruin the night, as little pick-me-up, I decided to cut before I left. Well, I didn't know till right before we left that my ex was bringing her boyfriend. We're still friends but I am NOT over her and she didn't tell me he was coming. So, I went into the bathroom and cut through that same cut. Apparently, I cut deeper than I thought as, 3 hours later, I took my phone out of my pocket and it was covered in blood. I bled all the way through my jeans to the top and all of my friends saw. Only one said something and she took me to the side and we talked. I was so upset about projecting my problems onto others and, in effect, ruined their night. On top of that, all of my friends know that I cut now. I just feel so ashamed, pathetic, and embarrassed. Again, this is not the reason I am suicidal, it's just me needing to vent after a tough night. I'm suicidal because in the past year, I was probably only happy for three weeks. The rest of the time I have been miserable. I just don't know that it is worth it anymore. I'm starting to feel so bad that I almost don't care that my family will miss me. I just see it as my world will be over and that would be the end of that. I wouldn't have anything else to deal with. I am just so ashamed of myself. Of the cutting and the way I acted. 
I've been self-harm free for a little over a year now, but i still struggle with the impulse every day. It's exhausting to have to rely on your already busy, depressed, anxious mind to have enough self-control and motivation not to do something that used to be a short-term fix to help you feel better. Whether you relapse, or have been going strong like me, keep moving forward and be proud of yourself each day you don't hurt yourself. You've made it this far. You are strong. There IS hope. I've never met any of you but I love you all and believe in you and that together we can get better. feel free to PM me for advice or support
To anyone who might be struggling right now, things do get better. I still self harm sometimes, but I have not had a panic attack in a while. I used to just about get them daily and hurt myself very often. Now I do relapse like once every few months, but I am getting better. I have grown so much from my down moments and I just wish that I could give everyone who is struggling a massive hug, or help you guys realize that you are amazing and can be strong, even if you think you are not, you are. Or just help you out in some way. I know how it feels to go through shit and how one kind person can help, and I hope this helps a bit. I believe in you. You can make it through. You are strong.
Our research team at Vanderbilt University is currently conducting a study on risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The primary goal of the study is to better understand what thoughts, feelings, and experiences motivate suicidal thoughts and behaviors.We are interested in recruiting people who use this website to participate in our research study.Participation is completely voluntary.

last time i cut i downloaded one of those apps that tracks how long you've been 'sober' and today's count is 2 months 10 days..however, while in the shower i held out my hand under the water and switched from scolding hot to freezing cold over and over in repetition till i couldn't feel anything any more, once out of the shower i put icy hot over the area so it would sting longer and i guess im aware that i self harmed but i'm hesitant to reset the app because it wasn't cutting. i'm not sure what i should do. this is really confusing i'm sorry i just don't know what would help me more.
This one is a bit of a long one, so I hope you'll forgive the length. About six months ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression. Instead of taking the pills that I was prescribed, though, I instead chose other outlets. One of those outlets was self harm. About three times a week, or whenever I felt especially down, I'd self harm. I won't go into great detail, because that's not what this story is about. That being said, I eventually did (with the help of many, many, supportive people) manage to eventually ween myself away from self harm. I had not felt the urge to self harm (or decompression for that matter) for a considerable amount of time. Self harm is though, a terrible poison, one that can stay in your system for days, weeks, months, even years, waiting in a dormant state to reveal itself at just the right time. For me that right (or perhaps more accurately wrong) time was yesterday evening. I was invited to watch my cousin play in her volleyball tournament. So, at 4:45 am, I was off to a giant volleyball center in the middle of Ohio. I didn't really expect anything to happen unusually that day, but of course it did (I hope your still with me at this point, as I'll be getting to the point shortly). The rest of the team was all there around 5:00, and I immediately noticed the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. She was No. 17 on my cousins team, and all I knew about her was her name was Gwen. I may have looked as if I was cheering for my cousin all day, but really I was trying to work up the nerve to talk to Gwen. All day I practiced my lines, fixed my hair in the bathroom mirror, and even watched a couple corny "How to:" videos on YouTube. At the end of the day, after a solid 14 hours of being in a freezing volleyball gym and watching my Prime Numbered Beauty from a distance, I got up to talk to her. About to seconds before I approached her, though, I changed my mind. I, instead kept walking, and pretended that I didn't hate myself for chickening out, and walked to the car. My uncle dropped me off at home at I went directly to my room. This is where the struggle happens, so rightfully so --TRIGGER WARNING-- I got my knife and I held it against my right forearm. I had a million thoughts pouring throughout my mind. "You're a failure." "It's a good thing you didn't talk to her, she deserves better." "What a loser." etc. etc. One fateful thought crept into my mind though, and out shined the others. "You've been clean for six months, why stop now?" I thought about this over and over in my mind, "Why stop now?" As I lowered the knife from my wrist, I had already knew I won. Temporarily, at least. There are a couple things I want you to get from this story. The first is "Why stop now?" I don't care if you've been clean for a day or a year, if you ever get the thoughts we've all had, think to yourself, "I've managed to make it this long, let's try a little longer." If you can push yourself a little longer, even if you relapse, next time you'll be able to go longer, and longer. The next thing I want you to get from this post is to think. If I hadn't thought that thought at that moment, I would have done it, and I would be in a much worse place now. So please, please, always think. The last thing isn't necessarily for self harm, more just words to live by. Never, ever let a complement go unsaid, ever. I don't care how embarrassed you may be by telling someone how you feel, even if you just met them, you could quite literally change their lives. I know this was poorly written, but I hope you got the main points. If you ever need help with coping or just want to vent, or talk, or whatever, do not hesitate to contact me. 
Hi guys.I browse here often enough because I have a problem. In the past I've just scratched my forearms until the skin is somewhat raw, but over the last year it hasn't been enough. I've turned to the blade.I haven't hurt myself in the last nine months, on part of my bf's guilt and I've been coping. Now, with University and a new low-spending budget I simply cannot cope anymore. I made my first tiny marks on my knee just about five minutes ago. It was punishment and a way to prevent a crying meltdown at work. The burning sensation, like a papercut, is keeping me distracted from my own anxiety.I feel like a failure. I can't cope without spending money on things for myself, so here is where I am again. 9 months gone.
Hey!    I didn't cut for a month now and I'm kinda proud of it but I think the only reason I don't cut anymore is that I started to have suicidal thoughts and I'm contemplating suicide every fucking day.    Is this bad?
That's all lol
does anyone else overdose as a form of self harm? I just want to know if I am in the right place, or if I should just leave forever. I wasted your time, more than likely... but eh. I relapsed back to overdosing so I don't matter anyways. 
Was it a sudden epiphany? A build-up of things? What was your thought process? How did you, or are you, doing it?Two weeks ago, my boyfriend threatened to break up with me if he ever saw me with new cuts. We...have had a rough four months. It took long talks with two friends to make me realise just what I had to do - find and make my own happiness without relying on him or his happiness.I was too late. He's now my ex. Last Sunday, we talked about the relationship and the self-harm. I chose to break and throw away my box cutter to show him I was serious about trying to change. I left myself with no alternatives: I have to move forward, with or without him. It wasn't enough. I'm just sorry I hurt him.I took away my own safety net the night I needed it the most. The withdrawal is...immensely painful. But when I'm done grieving, I fully plan on filling the emptiness in my life with running and football, and finding the fun in the little things. My cutting cost me a three year relationship. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for that.
First it started just talking to a friend about a bridesmaid dress with a slit that  shows my scars on my legs. Then I was bored and immediately thought about cutting because it feels so good. Then I felt upset and the urge grew. Over the last few hours, it's all I can fucking think about. I want to cut SO BAD right now. Every cigerette, I want to put it out on my skin. I just want to feel that pain.  I just want comforted. Reached out to THREE PEOPLE. It didn't help. I want to make it to 30 days. One more week and my reward is a new tattoo. I just don't think I'm going to make it. The urge is too fucking strong. Fuck my fucking life. Fucking this fucking addiction.
I've been self harming a lot recently my legs are all fucked up and i want to stop but i cant control myself I've tried throwing away any razors i had but its not a very good solution because if i feel like self harming i find another way to do it and i dont know i know nobody would ever see my cuts because theyre on my upper thighs i want to stop for me though 

Like I should be better at hurting myself, I deserve worse pain than then but I'm too much of a pussy to cut further than centimetre or two. Sorry if this seems attention whorey I just wanted to let it out and see if anyone relates, if this is in the wrong sub reddit I apologise, I realise this doesn't really help stop self harm I just didn't know whereelse to put it

Hey, so... I know most people on this subreddit are dealing with things related to cutting behaviors or more violent types of self-abuse, and I was just wondering if anyone had experience with (or even heard of) excoriation disorder. Wikipedia has a short article on it if you're curious what it is. I'm pretty certain I suffer from it myself and I just don't know how to stop myself.  Essentially no one knows I have it, and even those I've admitted it to (doctor, councilor) don't really understand the extent. I didn't even know it was a thing until a few months ago when I stumbled across someone talking about it as a type of self-harm. It's really difficult for me to discuss with anyone, considering it's so unheard of and sounds, well, completely ridiculous. I'm just not sure where to turn. All I know is that it's gotten a lot worse over the last year that my life has spiraled down. Now I've horribly scarred myself for life and I make it worse almost every day, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

About 6 months ago I struggled with self harm. I've got myself out of that slump but I still have super visible scars on my left forearm. I don't care if strangers see but it's just not a conversation I want to have with my friends and family just yet. I also don't like seeing them on me, they are just a painful reminder that I don't need.I have tried vitamin E oil extensively but it only helped for a very short time. So I did a little more research and found out that latex and silicone are the best method for scar removal.  So I got Scar Away Silicone Scar Sheets from kroger. I think they were on sale for like $19 for a three month supply. My scars are super red. I tried every makeup technique, even bought $30 dermablend cover stuff. But the scars were just too red. I have been using Scar Away for about a month now and I have already seen major improvements. My scars are much less red and the ends of the scars have even turned white/skin tone. I'm hoping before the summer I can fade them away enough to where makeup will cover them, I'm a lifeguard so I kind of have to have my arms exposed. I just wanted to share with somebody in hopes of helping someone out there who may be in a similar circumstance. One day I will have to explain them, it's just not something I'm ready for yet. 
It helped a bit... i did try writing in my journal today. 
I haven't felt this low... in months...  i'm getting flash backs of when i was trying to express sadness to my mom and she'd get mad at me. 'you're not grateful for what you have' 'can i see a smile?! seriously?' 'you're no fun to be around' 'you have such an attitude problem'

You can name the butterfly after someone you love, or have a loved one draw it for you.Write the name of a loved one [a friend, family member, or anyone else who cares about you] and write their name where you want to self harm.

I'm exhausted. I've been going out of my comfort zone and out of my way to become such a more talkative person and trust that the people I communicate with are my friends, instead of being my paranoid and insecure self.But I feel like I'm being constantly reminded that I'll live to be alone. I feel like I've never had the choice to enjoy life. I live with constant reminders of the bad things I've done when I was younger and the terrible and depressing shit that happens around the world. I've made friends with people who's fathers and grand fathers sexually abused their siblings and family, and were never brought to justice. I've made friends with people who are in such sad situations because of lack of money and funding for education and other things they need to live.I know what it means to be sad. The constant cold embrace that never leaves you alone and keeps you crying in bed, thinking you're worthless and lonely. I've tried to be positive, welcoming, sincere, generous.. I feel like I've got no way to go but this one path, to focus on just sacrificing my life and free will to just solely help people. It's not that I don't think it's a noble cause, but I feel like I'm destined to go about it without ever having the luxury of friends or love.I'm pathetic, but I had to try and write this. Maybe someone out there can offer guidance.I don't feel like I deserve to be happy, I wish I was just some dumb and destructive teenager with a drinking problem and sleeping with every dumb but attractive girl he sees. But instead I'm some pathetic fool who can't stop feeling sad because we seem so far from world peace, the earth's polluted and people won't help each other.
For me, it comes in a fantasy of ripping the veins in my wrist out by the handful. I don't know why, that's just the visualization that I get and crave. The reality is that when I do hurt, I cut my legs. I want to so bad, but it's getting warm and there's no way I could hide it. The other day I accidentally scratched myself on some chicken wire, and the throbbing in the shower was a horrible feeling to relish. It's been months since I last cut. I'm trying to hold back, I have so much pent up in me. Any advice on things to do to get the urge out would be great. I want to throw things but that'd wake my roommates up. 
I hate myself today. I realized a fundamental truth about myself earlier this month. Unfortunately this does not mesh with my SO's beliefs. We've been together 7 years, and I love her to death. But there's something I need, something missing. I talked to her about it, and it boiled down to I could accept who I realize I am and lose her (and the amazing life we've built together), or I can stay and miss that piece of my heart forever. I told my SO I'd suppress this part of myself for her, I'd give up a huge part of my soul for her. It hurt us both immensely when I told her, and when I asked for advice from our best friend she shut me down in a way I never expected. I am also losing one (or three, depending on how you look at it) of the only friends I've ever made all on my own because of this. He/they have what I want to be able to have. I feel so guilty. I've hurt the main people I care about. I feel so isolated, alone, invisible.My soul aches, and is filling with darkness I haven't felt in a long time. I keep wanting to hurt myself somehow. I'm so emotionally overwhelmed right now, I know it would bring me at least some temporary relief. At least enough to get me through the next 6 hours of work without bawling all damn day. 
It seems like it's always on my mind. I can't seem to get away from it. The thought is always leering at me. I'm just one simple slice away from messing up my clean streak. One slice away from that satisfying pain. It has a hold on me greater than anything. I can fight this, but I can't do this on my own. I ask for help, but it doesn't make the thoughts go away. I have to fight myself day in and day out, everyday for the rest of my life. This is exhausting. 
that term is new to me but it makes sense after yesterday. My best friend is very unhealthy and I'm not much better. When together we trigger each other so much. I hope dropping this person improves my life and hersid suggest everyone drop triggers in your life no matter how hard it mught be
I've been clean from burning for a little over a year now, and every day I still get the itch on my mind to do it again. The urge gets really strong sometimes and I feel like I have no other outlet when depression or anxiety hit hard that day. Is there ever a point where you stop wanting to do it? At this point I'm thinking I may just be a masochist.

I'm sorry if I'm not posting with proper regard to your community's standards, there's not much in the sidebar...Let me start with that I've never cut myself, or done something similar. Although I have no problem with blood or anything, had my fair share of wounds due to sport and like playing with knives, the simple thought of digging a knife into my flesh gives me shivers. That's the reason I didn't go down the road a couple of times. Also freak out from needles, may be related, dunno.Anyway, a friend told me a day or two ago that he'd cut his arm. A depressed friend that is. So I wondered. As it seems (in my personal experience also), most people who self harm are teenage girls seeking attention, but that's not the case for everyone... That friend in particular is a male with no need for that. And the only reason I could think of to do it, is if your brain releases hormones that make you feel happy and in peace when you cut... Is it like that? Do you get happy and/or relieved when you cut yourself?
Why. I wish I knew. Like, it makes me feel better... In a way. I always said it was a way to express the emotions I have no idea how to express in words. The only difference this time is I'm hiding it. I'm ashamed of it.My arms are covered in scars, but tonight I cut my leg for the first time. Hiding it from my roommate and girlfriend. Why am I now ashamed of it. Why am I now cutting again. I'm better off then I was a year ago. But I still deal with these depressive thoughts, the suicidal ideation, the want to give up. I don't even know why I'm writing this. Last attempt to reach out got down voted. It just reaffirmed my disgust for myself, that no one truly cares. If you read this, thanks, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for. I just hope I don't start up again like I used to. There will be no hiding it if it gets that bad. 

I'm not. I'm so far from it. I need help. I'm scared to see a therapist because I live in a shitty area that doesn't have much for help. I had a great therapist in high school, but she moved to somewhere that only deals with under 18. I saw her as long as I could, got transferred to her place, but now I can't go there (25 now, stopped seeing her at 19).I tried to see someone new (at 23) in my small town, but it was an awful experience. I tried for months to make it work. It didn't. I don't really have options on finding someone new.I cut last night. It has been a few months. And a few months before, and a few months before, and again.I need to stop. Last night was a, "I want to just end it," night. So I fucked myself up with it. Until I thought about my son. And I can't just leave him.Last night was a bad night. Other nights have just been to relieve myself. But I'm stuck with signs of my fuck ups.Im just babbling now. I need to stop. I've been doing since I was 8, by accident but it just did something.I can't keep doing this. And after last night, I'm terrified to not wear long sleeves because I thought last night would be the last. I'm sorry for the babbling. I just... I don't know.
When I'm sad, upset, frustrated, and sometimes when I'm angry I'll hurt myself.I'm in a masters program at a top ranked ivy league school where everyone around me is a fucking genius from China. I struggled a lot with school my first semester and felt similarly, but I managed to keep things off at bay this semester for a while now, but I can't continue anymore.I got below a 50% grade on a homework assignment in an environmental statistics class. I was working for homework for hours after having hours of class, I saw a thumbtack next to me and I pierced my hand with it until I drew blood. Normally I just yell and scream and hit myself, but this time I needed to feel just how numb I was inside.I've realized that I hate what I'm studying. I'm not good at epidemiology and biostastics and environmental science (the interdisciplinary gist of the topics I study). I wish I could have turned back time and applied for molecular biology PhD programs instead. Yes, PhD, I have to pay $80,000 (not including living expenses) to get a masters degree just so that I'm eligable to apply for a public health PhD, since you can't just jump into them from undergrad like you can with biology or math or chemistry. Since I got here I've learned that the physiological/epigenetic impacts of health research are what I want to do with my life after all these years of dicking around with environmental studies and economics in undergrad. The phd program at my elite school that I want to apply for focuses on biological public health, but guess what? I didn't take physics and organic chemistry in undergrad, so now that I know what I want to do, I don't even have a fucking chance to do it. In the meantime, I'll have to take a bunch of classes next year that don't have anything to do with what I really want to do in my life.I'm doing an unpaid laboratory research internship this summer to try and learn the things I need to continue on the path that I actually want to. I'm excited and grateful for that, but I don't know how the fuck I'm supposed to make enough money to pay the rent and afford to eat over the summer. My school wouldn't give me any opportunites or ideas or ways to deal with this and I'm freaking out because no matter what, I just can't win. I don't know what I'm going to do and its so upsetting and I just keep hitting myself until I'm calm again, until I get angry again and then its all just the same shit over and over again.Grad school is destroying my confidence, and completely stripped the passion I had for public health and turned it into nothing but a bitter reminder of why I should have been pre-med in college.Help.
...of suicide attempts and self loathing. Somewhere along the line wires got crossed in my brain and the result is that my mind actually feels proud of itself when I self-harm. But I'm going to lose my fiance if I keep putting myself in the hospital -- I've got to find a way to break my habit of cutting and scratching.
My friend was just cutting herself with what I'm guessing is a fairly blunt blade. She was texting and talking over the phone while doing it. She's stopped now but I'm scared something like this might happen again and I want to help her because I couldn't do much this time. If it helps she's fifteen or sixteen and cut herself because of her family. This isn't the first time she's done it but it's the first I'm aware about. I don't know her address and I don't know if calling her parents would really help her. We live in Malaysia and I don't know how the police might respond to this and therapy and mental health treatment is looked down upon. Any help is much appreciated

My brain feels so befuzzled. I just feel so blah. It's not the depression like normal. I want to cut to feel something again. 
I hit myself in the head a lot when I'm experiencing emotional pain. Closed fists, but not *overly* hard. Also, I'm wondering if it's doing brain damage and just making things worse. If football players can take heavy damage from microconsussions alone, I would posit that more numerous, heavier blows, which are also more frequent, would be significantly worse.

just curious. I cut and I feel a wave of good energy. What if I am actually injured? Will I be fucked one day because my pain response has been overused? Is there any evidence?
 I am former cutter who is right now buckling under exam stress and from quitting smoking. I haven't cut myself in ten whole years but somehow the thought crept back into my mind this week. It's amazing how much school can crush your self worth, it is amazing how much reality can crush your self worth! Anyway I just wanted to say I did and it was in part from perusing this subreddit. So thanks.

I made my screen saver on my phone "I am focused" so every time I look at my phone (Which is a ton) I will remember to keep my eyes on the prize.Also listening to positive affirmations on YouTube. If you haven't heard of them its just someone saying positive things for 20 mins or so. I hope this helps someone else. I would also recommend therapy. I use to think it was a joke but hearing other people in group you realize they have feelings too and you can learn from them but you can also educate them or motivate them.
I just can't escape it. Every time I try and put it aside, it comes and when it comes back I want to remove myself from the reach of anyone. I deserve to be alone. I love to be alone. Everyone does better without me, and there's always someone else for someone when it comes to love. I'm obsessed with Bruce Wayne and the way he lives. He's been such an idol to me and he's given me strength and will in my darkest time. But I feel addicted to this depression, paranoia, anxiety because I feel like I need to prove to him and myself, that I can be him. That I understand his pain. I wasted almost 6 years of my life because of my issues. I have a never ending weight on me because I ruined 2 peoples lives just by being born. That burden is something I carry to the grave.I've tried putting it aside to meet and befriends many people. But I just feel, that no one will ever understand me because of how I've been idolizing someone who just doesn't accept happiness, and now I feel like I can't either.. Or even that I don't deserve it.. I feel like I don't enjoy being happy either, compared to sitting in the dark in front of my PC monitor, thinking about pain, hardship, poverty, death, suicide, crime, rape, murder.. The injustice that goes on the world and how backwards society has gone. No one should be with a crazy damned nut like me.I can't accept living a normal life, without risk, without sacrificing myself. But at the same time, I've always just been hoping to be with someone who'd accept me and love me.I'm sorry to mind boggle so many people with how pathetic I am, I'm sorry you read this. I just hope I can find some random piece of wisdom that could advise me on what I.. I'm not sure if I should be doing anything. I just want everyone to live in peace and harmony. But what do I do? I also have.. people I know.. Whom I love as human beings.. that have been through so much.. One them had an alcoholic father, that raped their sister.. One of them had a grand father that sexually abused their younger sister and cousins for years but it was never found out until recent.. One of them has a girlfriend with bullimia, who's taken away all freedom of him looking at the media due to her insecurities, he has no dreams anymore and he won't leave her, his life is an empty shell of what it used to be.. I'm just rambling at this point.. I hope you all have a good life, take care of yourself and your loved ones and follow your dreams, you beautiful people.
Me (15) and my girlfriend (14) have been together for almost 4 months. As far as relationships our age go we are very serious. I love her very much but her self-harm tendencies hurt me. I want her to stop, and she knows that too but no promises were made. The past two weeks I have been feeling very shittily and today I saw some fresh cuts and I almost broke down in school. When I came home I came to the realization that her cutting is a major reason why I feel so hopeless and depressed lately. I have taken out my sadness and frustration on her and though about breaking up, although she may not know it. I don't know why I am such a shitty person but I want to change, I want to be the best person for her but I don't know how. I feel helpless, no matter how many I love you's and reassuring I will never leave her because of this I still feel like im not doing enough. Although most of her problems are from the past, it still hurts me whenever I see new or old cuts. Am I a shitty person? How can I help her? Is it sometimes best to just leave it alone? Her family knows about it and she is seeking help, should I just leave it up to them to help her? I know she deeply cares about me and many times before she said Im the only reason she is trying to quit completely. I just want to help her, should I not tell her about whenever I feel sad or cry because of this?
The lust for the pain is too big.
I am not so much a cutter  I just like playing with knifes . is that weird?its just I like the feeling of something sharp on my skin .
I'm 15. I have a friend who is depressed, and self harms. I told her that if she wants to hurt herself, she can call/text me. What exactly should I do if she contacts me and wants to cut/hurt herself?

I haven't cut since last summer, but my whole life is falling apart around me, because of actions I am solely responsible for. I know cutting is not truly going to help me, but that release is what I'm craving. Even just *thinking* about my blood coming out to say hi is comforting. You can give advice if you want, but I don't think it'll make me feel better.
Hi all,I'm a teacher in a high school and has problems cutting and other self harm all through college and even into my adulthood. Since it isn't really something that stops I still sometimes struggle with it. Anyways there has been a huge uprising in cutting in our female population at my school and after sharing my experiences with the school counselor I have been paired up with one of the extreme cases to be her mentor. Now I am not her counselor, I've made that very clear. I am there to instruct her in keeping safe while cutting and understanding her feelings/rituals around cutting. So my question is, what would you like a mentor to do with you or say to you if you had the chance? As another person who self harms I am coming into this with a unique perspective but I would like input into how I can be the most effective mentor.
So i started harming myself by cuting a few moths back after years of resisting the urge, and tonight was one of those sleepless nights where the urge was to strong and my need to punish myself for skipping work was too mutch. So i cut myself and i realized that the first thing that popped into my mind after i was done was "good, Im getting the hang of this now" Is that bad? I fellt odly proud of myself.. But now i just feel pathetic.. Why am I even telling you this? Im not shure.. Mabey i whant someone to yell at me and call me stupid or mabey i want sympaty. I dont even know anymore. Im sorry. Im so sorry.

Title says it all. I am too much of a wuss to cut myself, and I've started to punch walls, bookshelves, trees... anything. It hurts, and my hands are sore, and I'm forced to wear gloves.How do I stop? I want to, but the pain is somewhat addicting.
I'm especially interested in judo, since I want to spar and I've always thought judo looked, I dunno, beautiful, almost like a competitive form of ballet. I'm small and light and I've never played a contact sport, but I'm in good shape and I'm looking for some combat to go with my internal harmony and discipline. I'm not even too concerned about winning or losing, I think (safe) fighting would be good for me.
So I'm no stranger to suicidal thoughts - I've had them for years. I've always been strong enough to fight against them and have never once self-harmed myself.Today, I don't know what just happened, but I wanted to so badly. I didn't have anything nearby, and just played with this small blade that I use to cut my cuticles. Thankfully, it wasn't sharp enough to cut through my skin, and I'm forever grateful that I haven't gone down that path (yet).I don't want to hurt myself.I don't want to scar myself.But I really want to and I feel the urge is going to be too strong one day and I'll give in.But for now, I'll continue to fight it as best as I can.
We are a Harvard University research team currently working on a study to better assess self-injurious thoughts and behaviors.  If you are interested in participating, you will complete an online screener to see if you qualify to participate. If you qualify, you will complete a variety of questionnaires online and then you will be contacted 2 weeks later to answer some more questions. For completing the first part, you will be entered into a raffle for a chance to win a $100 gift card to Amazon (1/100 odds). For completing the second part, you will be paid a $5 gift card to Amazon.  A few important things to know about the study are:1.    The study includes questions regarding self-harm. Some people may feel that talking about these topics is difficult and may find it to be triggering.2.    All information collected will be kept confidential and private. 3.    Participation is completely voluntary. 4.    If you're interested, we will email you a link to a website asking you a few questions to see if you qualify to participate. 5.    If you start to participate and decide you no longer feel comfortable or you are no longer interested, you can end it without any penalty or punishment.6.    We will provide links to treatment resources throughout the study.  Please message me if you are interested in participating. Once you contact me, I will send you a link to the screening questionnaire to see if you qualify and will answer questions you might have.  Thank you for your consideration!
I've not cut for like, two years or so now, and all my scars have healed up, but recently I've been feeling so low and scared and pissed off with myself because of this girl that I just had so so much emotion in me on sunday and I cut, and since then i've been doing it again and again because I've remembered how good it felt and how amazing the release is.It's just really fucked because I thought it would be fine when I wasn't as emotional but the urge is still there
I can't stop cutting my thighs with a plastic butter knife. Last week I was flirting (ima boy) with my friend (girl). I pulled her up on my lap. She was hesitant and said stop but was laughing so I ignored her. i got hard and she freaked. I know that's sexuall harassment. She must have felt helpless/weak, I feel so guilty, what to do?
I know it's bad for me, but it feels so good. It just feels amazing.
Yesterday and today I did something I never thought I'd do. And I have no reason for doing it. Last night I took a lighter and gave myself atleast 2nd degree burns on my forearm. I then went to sleep and when I woke up I just went ballistic. I took a meat cutting knife and started sawing away on my right leg until it bled. I was yelling and punching the walls and going in and out of anger and sadness and just asking "why is this happening, what's wrong with me". Then I took a  liquor glass and smashed it in my hands, blood ran down my arms and I started crying. But I smashed atleast 4 more and just kept doing it. Now my hands are all fucked up. Why am I doing this?! What should I tell my parents? I'm a 16 year old male and I'm so confused with my mind.
I've been clean since new years day but I can already feel myself falling back into an old mindset that will eventually lead to a relapse. I want to catch it this time before it's too late. Thoughts on how to stay strong and aware to prevent a relapse? can it be done?
I feel really fucking weird, I don't know how much blood I lost. I needed to bleed a lot so I did, but I had to lie down before I felt I'd lost enough because I feel really off. How do you tell how much you've lost so you don't over do it?Also, I definitely won't be seeking medical help, I only JUST got out of the psych ward where I was being abused and followed around by a rapist murderer schizophrenic who locked onto me and another patient- I am NOT being locked up in there again. Just want to do this more safely next time it happens.
Okay so this is a throwaway and I honestly have no idea whether or not this is the right place for me to post this so apologies if it isn't.I have a blood test tomorrow. It's very important that I do it because I've been anemic for a long time and they need to see whether I'm improving or not and if they have to take any extra steps since my symptoms have increased. The thing is, I have self harm scars. Not just on one arm either, I have at least 200 on both forearms. They aren't fresh (I haven't self harmed for 6 months) but since I have dark skin, even though they've faded, they're still very noticeable, especially in close proximity like the doctor'll be. I'm 16 years old and all day today at school I have been thinking about this, it triggered 2 panic attacks and the nurse even sent me home early, I am SO worried about this, I think this is the most scared and worried I've been for years. The last time I had a blood test, the scars were only on one arm so it was fine. I just don't know what the doctor is going to say and the way I'm feeling, I think that when they tell me to pull my sleeve up I'll probably have another panic attack because just the thought of what's to come tomorrow has my heart palpitating. My Dad is coming with me and that doesn't even scare me too much because even though he's never seen them, he does know that I used to self harm and I am sure that I can tell him to wait outside. I'm just scared of the doctor judging me or something else, to be honest I'm not even 100% sure of what I'm scared of, it's kind of the idea of someone being so close to my scars and me having to reveal them like that. There's no way I can get out of this so does anyone have any ideas for covering them up? Bracelets etc won't work because they go all the way up to my elbow and kind of spread onto my upper arms. I don't own any foundation either! :(. It feels like there are no options, so does anyone even have any advice or just reassuring words? I really need them right now, I'm panicking so much. Not sure if this is relevant, but I'm in the UK so do any other people from here with scars have any experience they can share? Sorry for the long post.
DAE have giant raised fibrous scar tissue from burns that are YEARS old?I was deep into self harm when I was a teenager & young adult. I cut a lot, but burns made bigger scabs that I liked to rip off. I have several tattoos, including a large thigh piece on each thigh that conceals my cutting scars well. However, I'm VERY self conscious about the raised burn scars. One large "X" on my wrist & "FAT" burned onto the right side of my hip bone. (Still struggling with EDNOS, not self harm. I'm 26.)These areas cannot be tattooed due to the severity of the fibrous scar tissue. It won't take ink. Concealer or any kind of makeup does not help. Am I alone? If not, how do you handle it? (Large raised stubborn fibrous BURN scars/brands only)
i get into difficult moods sometimes where nothing i do makes me feel better. it's almost like a frustration, build up of energy, and i can't do anything to relieve it... like my mind is uncomfortable and i get this urge for self destructive behaviours, like a compullsion. anyone else feel like this sometimes? i just want to be calm and content all the time- what helps you realign your mood?
Not necessarily to cover up scars, I'd have to get big ones in multiple places to do that.I've been thinking about how I use my scars sometimes as a symbol I can look at to remind myself of all the hard shit I've gone through and overcame. I can capture a similar feeling though if I had a tattoo to look at instead. I want a small tattoo on my inner lower arm that reminds me that I am strong and can overcome anything.I'm curious if anyone here has gotten tattoos for similar reasons and what you got? I don't have any strong ideas yet. I like the semi colon idea but I'm not necessarily sold on it yet.
I have a lot of trouble getting my mind back on to what I'm supposed to be doing when I'm having a hard time. I have so much work to do in such a limited time frame to complete the semester, I have to find a job for the summer, as well as handle the day to day tasks of taking care of myself living on my own. However, I can't seem to get myself going, everything always gets pushed aside because of how shitty this month has been for me in the self harm department, I can't shift my mind from those thoughts for long enough to do anything productive. This is becoming a problem with upcoming deadlines, yet all I can do is lie in bed watching netflix and wallow. I need motivation, or a way to refocus myself on the things that are actually important.How do you guys get yourself out of that mindset and focus on what needs to be done when everything seems so bleak and meaningless? 
This is usually my to area for cutting because no one sees it. Today I had the urge to harm myself but I heard about the idea when you want to harm draw on yourself. So I took out a green sharpie and just wrote on my thighs. That way if I did have the urge to harm later when I went to I would be greeted by those quotes. Which I looked at them many time...they make me happy. It's weird but it's a much better alternative 
Why do I do this to myself? I constantly brutalize myself just because I feel I need to. It sounds so stupid. Can't go a week without having that feeling. Am I missing something? Am I making a big deal out of nothing?
I haven't done anything with a knife in 4 years, but recently I've been intentionally climbing one route at my gym that does a lot of friction damage if you try enough times.  Processing that injury, I realized again how much I want it.  Moreover how much I want it NOW in my life.  I'm pretty isolated these days, and I'm anxious awake and asleep, and it's like I can wash it all away for a tiny little while.  So I just keep going back to that one route, climbing it until I'm bloody.And last week I told my girlfriend.  It was so hard, and I held it back because we only had three days in the same city, but it felt good to say and she was loving about it even if she didn't understand.  My dreams have been awful this week.  I'm terrified the whole time, chased, fighting an imposter family or some fucked up bird-headed things, hacking away at their limbs but no matter how hard I try I can't get completely through.Before, I felt like I could never cut again, because I wouldn't keep secrets from my girlfriend.  Now I actually feel less like shit when I think about doing it, like I've given myself permission in telling her?  And it does almost seem worth it.  Even aside from the calming effects.  I could, what if I only did it when I really fuck up, use this to condition myself into some other better person?  Scars are a good deterrent.  I've thought about it and, of all of the monsters at the wheel, SH seems like the least disgusting.  The one that doesn't make me nauseous thinking about, the one that doesn't freeze me in place with the weight of it.  What if I keep this one and use it to eat the rest?  How bad could that be, really.  I don't know, bad, probably.  For now, it's back to the wall I guess.
I just wanted to say this because I feel really proud of myself. I haven't self harmed since mid-January of this year.TW I guess.It all started around February of 2015. I was under some stress. I recently found out I was transgender, and I was sick of people calling me my birthname and old pronouns.I was also struggling with a relationship. It was a one-sided relationship, me crushing on my friend. I'd rather not talk about it.Anyways, during that relationship, I came home from school and laid on my bed and listened to a song that reminded me of something really good. I got really vivid memories.When it was over, I felt extremely... sad? Because I couldn't experience it again.So I looked through my drawers, and low and behold I found a pencil sharpener.Long story short, I had two tiny cuts on my arm. The person I was in that relationship with tried to make me feel better.Then one day, around Valentine's day, I came home.And I cut myself. Over and over, until I had around 30 cuts on my arms.Things like this happened, and then when that person left me for good, shit hit the fan. I started self harming more. Just cuts on my arms every once in a while, or my breast.I'd rather not go into too much detail of what happened the rest of the year. That person was extremely abusive. I carved their names into my ankles twice.Then, in November, I had some extremely bad breakdowns. Three days in a row.I ended up going to the hospital for a safety evaluation. I told the guy there about everything, and how I cut myself.When me and my mom got home, she took my blades away.All was well.Except...December.Christmas, in my opinion, was bad. I don't want to talk about that either. But on the 27th, I went to my aunt's for a dinner party.I got extremely upset. I felt tears dripping down my face.I went upstairs, to the bathroom, and looked around.There it was.The eyeliner sharpener.I unscrewed the razor out with a scissor blade, and sliced my thighs. Not too deep, but enough so that there was a lot of blood.I flushed the razor, dabbed my thighs with toilet paper, and went down. The blood bloomed through my leggings, but I luckily had a long T-shirt on.Fast forward to mid-January.I don't know why, but I craved to cut. My mom was gone, so I checked her room.By her makeup was the DS game holder I used to store my razors, and inside, my razors.I cut my thighs again, but only 5 times. And very tiny cuts.I haven't self harmed since.I had some extremely tough times in between January and today. For example, my best friend of all time left me and insulted me, and I attempted to hang myself.I'm glad I lived.My cuts are fading. I don't even know they're there. And on my thighs, I can barely see them. The carvings on my ankles are long gone. I don't feel self-conscious about going swimming now.I'm extremely proud of myself. Several times I attempted to cut again, but I resisted. Sometimes I get urges to cut for no real reason, but I did something else (talking to online friends about it helps me a lot, honestly). The one year of when I started self harming has long passed.My advice to people who want to cut and cutters: Stop. Please. I know it's an addiction. But it's going to ruin your skin. And honestly, do you *really* want to wear pants or a long-sleeve shirt in the summer? (Having to hide the cuts encouraged me to stop)So please, talk to someone if you want to cut. It does no good.And if you read this far, I love you.
Just cut myself again after around 3.5 months of being self harm free. I had been tempted to cut during the last two weeks and tonight I finally gave in. I feel like shit. I am am so ashamed of myself right now. And disappointed in myself. And disgusted with myself.I'm trying to take deep breaths and drinking water to calm down right now. I don't know what else to do. I am hoping typing this post will help. Lately, I have been really afraid of all the scars I have. I hide them so nobody knows. But I don't know how I will ever explain them when I am in a relationship. I have not been to see a therapist. There have been a few opportunities for me to go, but I have not taken them. I am a very shy and keep to myself so it is hard for me to talk to strangers. Also, I am on my parents health insurance and I don't know if they will notified if I go to a therapist. 
Sometimes, I crave the razor, like someone else would crave a food. Sometimes it's because of intense emotion, like sadness, to relieve that pressure in my chest. It makes me feel more awake. But this is the strange thing. Whenever I feel like picking up the razor, I can already feel the razor on my body, already cutting, even though it's like a hallucination or a ghost. Or if I see NSFW or possibly trigger warning content in a short film, like one I saw a bit back that actually  showed on camera of a girl slitting her wrist and committing suicide, I could feel it on my forearm. I can feel something tracing the path, from my wrist to my elbow. I was just wondering if this happened to anyone else.
Here's a little list of what I used to do when I tried to not SH, might help some people so why not sharing.Listening to music : All kinds of music, what you want, I used to listen to linkin park (mainly for the depressive lyrics) but if I need to I can listen to much more agressive music (System of a down, rage against the machine...) Even death metal sometimes (chton)Play a game : No need to choose a game in which you need to play daily etc. Just play something like Minecraft, try to build something, do funny things, experiments.Browse the internet : You can find hours of distractions on the internet, reddit, youtube, millions of websites...It worked pretty well for me because I did it until I was tired enough to sleep without having energy for self harming. I just wanted to sleep in the end, nothing else, and I actually loved and love sleeping so much because my brain finally turns off for some hours :)
I guess I should start this with some background info. I started self harming when I was 8, and began cutting when I was 12. Being 18 now, I obviously have scars. The worst of them are on my upper left thigh, and this is what  this post is for. Basically, The skin there has lost all feeling. I can' feel things brush against or touch my there. I'm fairly certain this isn't nerve damage. So is it just a result of built up scar tissue?
A year and a half ago, I was still the girl who sneaked away from her friends to sit on bathroom floors, dry-eyed, looking for relief in a razor. I was afraid of short sleeves and bikinis and changing in front of my friends. I thought everything good had already happened to me, the few things I had to look forward to were behind me, and it was all downhill from there. I thought I would never stop craving razors like some people crave chocolate, that blood would always be beautiful, and scars a mere inconvenience.That was eighteen months ago.Today I have been clean for enough months that I stopped counting. At the end of last summer, I threw away all of my razors and deleted my pictures of self-harm. I committed to taking my medication every day even when it screwed with my stomach or destroyed my libido. Because being alive is worth it.Today I just got back from spring break on the beach with friends I didn't even know last year. I wore a two-piece with shorts and even then, most of my scars were visible. Either no one noticed or no one chose to comment.Eighteen months ago I was convinced I would never be in a relationship because I had promised myself (and even ended a relationship because of it) that I would never date until I could be sure I wouldn't be pulling another person into my whirlwind world of depression and cutting. Now I am dating my best friend and I am in love with him and he knows all my past and he loves me with my scars.Eighteen months full of little fuck-ups with blades and a few episodes crying on the floor of my room and a healing so gradual you don't even notice it. But then you're here. And you're so much happier and fuller.This isn't your recovery story, I know. But a year and a half ago, what I wanted so desperately to hear was that it could get better. That the rest of my life didn't have to be filled with relapses and layering scars, buying bandaids with milk and eggs every week, and never daring to wear summer clothing.The rest of my journey isn't going to be a straight shot by any means. I probably will mess up, I probably will still add to my collection of scars, but I know I will be able to pick myself up and keep moving forward. It's that knowledge that buoys me up even on sad days when I can't stop searching out my scars or I find myself counting up the sharp things in my house or all I want is just one cut, just one little cut.So I know it's hard right now and I know it can be impossible to see anything else. But try to hold on for another eighteen months. Because so much can change so quickly and it is more than worth it to give life a chance to be beautiful.
feeling like i'm a god damn child.  it won't stop bleeding.  I'm not allowed to wear bandages without a glove over it at work.  so it's gonna be real obvious monday. at least this is my weekend off.  fml.

Im not even sure where to post this or if i can even repost but on r/suicidewatch someone advised me to post on other subs for more help. im sorry in advance for any mistakes, as im not 100% okay right now. Long story short, my boyfriend and I have been kicked out by my toxic family. We are on our own and very afraid. Thank goodness my boyfriends cousin is letting us stay on his couch! I may be able to stay some nights at my fathers until we are on our feet. My boyfriend works pt at target and im trying to find a job. we have a car but im the only one with a license, so we run a risk every time he drives himself to work to save on gas. we cant afford me to commute him back and forth and where we are staying is a good distance from his job. my anxiety goes thru the roof when he takes the car. im off all benzos right now due to a problem i unfortunately developed, so dealing with this anxiety plus stress from being homeless getting clean is so hard and i want to hurt myself or even worseI have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a while back and ADHD and Bipolar disorder recently. I have always struggled with self harm and i am desperately trying to keep from hurting myself right now. My mother died when i was 14. me and my family have never been the same since . Ive attempted suicide 3 years ago after becoming a self destructive drug addict/alcoholic at 15. A month in rehab and have not been consistently clean for more then a year since then. Ive recently relapsed, which kind of caused the whole mess me and my bf are in so im feeling very guilty, which makes everything worse! I struggled so hard to stay clean but i was for a year before this. I relapsed about 3 months ago. Just decided to abuse my meds like an idiot one day.My big 2 issues are mixing alcohol with my xanax. Or i mix my adderal with cocaine. My bf says i have to stop or he will not work with me on getting a place. Why cant i just fucking stop? Every time drugs pull me back in. I just want to end it. no diploma and jobless but searching for a min wage crap job to start saving for a shitty flat or studio. Im really thinking of selling my body again for money(used to when i was bad on drugs). i cant stay clean. my bf is seriously the only hope i have right now but i have to stop hurting myself and abusing drugs asap if im going to get through this. I have always had problems keeping a job but once i get one i have to try harder. currently sitting awake having a panic attack and craving drugs. fml TL;DR 19f gf and 21m bf kicked out of home. gf has a drug problem and mental health issues. feels like only options are to hurt myself/just end it or get a job and sell myself for money
Apology for formatting, I'm on mobile.I used to self harm all the time, starting in grade 5 and leading up until age 19 and I stopped a few months before I turned 20 because I hate the way I feel the day after I self harm. Now I'm almost at my 2 years clean anniversary, and every single day I don't cut or scratch myself, I feel the craving getting stronger and stronger. My skin sometimes feels like it's burning because I need it so bad... I just need the release, to let out all the bad and release the endorphins and feel good again... But I know I'm going to feel like a total failure after I do it, and then it'll just start the cycle all over again... I really need some help or advice or something.. 





i feel like a nobody. that i'm stupid. that i'm nothing. that i'm worthless. that i'm a waste of space. 
I'm upset at myself. I was alone with objects that I could hurt myself with and only stopped when I felt the sting against my skin. It's like I got hypnotized. I'm rapid cycling bipolar and in the major depressed phase. I cycle back and forth between mania and depression multiple times a day. It's exhausting to fight. I would love to hear some encouraging stories and what you're going through right now. Anything helps.2 days, 6 hours, 14 minutes sober. And counting.
I want to share this because it has been hugely helpful to me.  And maybe it could be for you.  By chance I was brought into the good habit of bouldering (rock-climbing with a nice big safety mat below) and I liked it.  I've never been a sports person, never an exercise person, but I really like climbing.  What blew my mind is that forcing myself to do the next thing, grab the next hold despite the pain and effort, it gives me the same 'fuck you, self, eat shit' feeling that self-harm has in the past.  Sometimes I do actually get hurt, and I get to relish it, like a badge.  And not fearing the injury has actually made me a more confident climber too.  They're two things that coexist well, and sustainably, in my head.  I know this won't click for everyone, but maybe you could share some alternatives you've found too?  It can still be hard, and I'd love a new distraction at the very least.
My dad is an elderly man, im 20. He's old, sick, works to much so its hard going to him with my problems when he never complains. I know I can't move on by myself and I know I have to make first step. I know he wants me to get help my mom committed suicide when I was a child so he's very understanding and money is also no issue. I just don't know what to say and we're pretty close. Its to hard for me but I really am ready to move on and get over this. I just want to make him proud ive failed him to many times sense getting out of high school
I relapsed about a month ago, a very minimal relapse at that. Talked to my therapist, husband, etc. I was doing OK until last night, relapsed again. This time worse. I get off work in 15 minutes. If I had it my way I'd be in the tub within the hour cutting.I know it's all on me but how do I prevent myself from doing this tonight? I really want to but I know it's not healthy. I should tell my husband and make him aware but I don't want him to stop me or worry. He doesn't know about last night. I just need some ideas. Edit: Lined up a babysitter of sorts. Ended up telling my husband about last night, he already knew somehow. We figured out a plan to get me through tonight so happy ending at least for now.
I know she told me she was super depressed, but I didn't expect her to do this. We even joked about how stupid it was like 2 week ago. I'm both angry and sad. What do I do to make her stop?
I've never really done it before but sometimes I put a knife against my wrist and want to slice but usually end up crying and can't. I think if my depression and anxiety issues had a more obvious sign then maybe people would care about me, but it probably wouldn't anyway because I had some bad cuts on my wrist from falling down some stairs and my dad ignored it anyway. 21 male commuting to work and college from emotionally abusive and neglectful home. I have depression and anxiety problems. 
It's a battle of control. When I used to hurt myself, it started as a way to be in control. On some level at least. To be in control of some aspect of my suffering. When I knew I had to stop was when the control had shifted. It was controlling me. It was always in my mind, I felt I was no longer making the choice.. This was over eight years ago.  Now it's controlling me again. And I'm not even doing it. But I can't stop thinking of it. It's controlling me and I don't even get the benefit of the action, of the pain and the relief. I feel the need to do it again, to regain this control, if only for a moment. The desire to go back is ruling my thoughts. I can't get help because they'll stop me from doing it, I need that freedom. I need to be able to make this choice. I can't tell anyone what I've been thinking or I'll be held accountable. I'm trying to apply self-destruction to anything else in my life to get a taste of that satisfaction. I need to do this, I need to get it out of my system. It's been so long.
Ever since I first started SHing, I became a master of disguise. Depending on where the damage was, I had it covered. No one could know my dirty little secret, and besides, what would they say when they saw what I've done to myself. I know what others have said when I got careless (accidentally rolling up my sleeves because I was hot, or carelessly wearing too short of sleeves). Things got awfully interesting when I went away to college, and had roommates and friends constantly in my personal space. Believe it or not I still maintained my secrets through the careful maneuvering of my body while changing in front of others.I'm sure this is an experience that some of you have shared, or continue to share. For the longest time I've thought about letting my scars show and no longer being afraid of what others will say, but it was easier to remain hidden and scared.Well, eventually I got myself into a situation where I could either miss out on a fun, bonding opportunity, or be vulnerable in front of my close friends. I decided to go with my friends on a trip to Chicago, and stay the night at the local Jjimjilbang (Korean bathhouse). Through this experience, I am now able to walk around shirtless in the dorms and not care if people see my scars anymore :) It's kind of liberating...
First I just want to apologize. I'm not very articulate or good at getting thoughts out.Tonight I had a relapse. I have journaled my selfharm urges and episodes for the last 2 months. Today is the first time I payed attention to how long an episode is. From my trigger till I was bandaged was 80 minutes. When I realized how long it had been I was shocked. I looked back at my older entires, now I'm a lot better self harm way less like 3x a month, I used to be in that state of mind for hours. Longest was 8 hours of just thinking of wanting to cut.
I have apparently inherited her temper. Like her, I get worked up over literally anything, even the most petty reasons... she likes to snap at everyone in sight when she's worked up, even forces me to listen to her ranting under the guise of "I am just giving you advice!". And I myself have had issues with my own temper, I get ticked off as easily as she does and often would get yelled at into submission when I do lose it. And with no one to turn to, no where to vent (my friends seem to be sick of hearing me out it seems and father is flat out apathetic). I started cutting, every time someone made me angry. And it felt good, knowing I had some form of release (for lack of a better word). So a couple months ago, I had stopped, I don't know how but I managed to suppress the urge....well until today that is. She's been getting worked up over the tiniest thing today and I just couldn't take any more of her rambling and shouting. I feel like total shit now.. apologies if this seems childish/immature or whatnot..
I mess up, but there is one thing that was different about this time. It didn't feel good to me, and it usually it does. I think that even the reason I tried in the first place, was because I was trying to prove to myself that I still wanted to do this. But I guess I don't. Now I don't know what to do with myself.

I just got home and WAS about to go to a friend's house, but as soon as I walked into my room I found my stuff thrown everywhere and I note from my mother saying "This is unacceptable you ARE not going anywhere." grabbed my blade and went at it again.
so yesterday I was with a good friend, and he suddenly felt very dizzy, sick and his eyes were moving in a special way, i don't know the english word. I am studying medicine and so i should have known, right away it was a stroke, but it didnt occure to me in that moment, only later after i had brought him home, he finnaly went to the hospital today, and it was a fucking stroke, and he will be off of work for at least 3 month. I feel so fucking stupid and useless, i will never be a good doctor, if I cant even figure out the basics, i hate myself right now, soo fucking much... and i want to cut, the only thing keeping me from it, that i dont want more scares.... I feel so stupid
My 9 year old daughter has reached the point where my telling her "Oh, that's just the way I am" is no longer adequate to explain my scars. I haven't cut or self-harmed in 16 years, the scars are white and faded, but they are there! My husband had a very emotional reaction when I asked his opinion on my finally being honest with my daughter about this. His fear is that she'll think cutting is a really great coping mechanism for her problems. It must be if her mother did it, right? He doesn't want me to provide this idea to her as an option. I explained that I discovered self-harm on my own, and that by being honest with her I would protect her by giving her information and building her trust in me. I completely understand his reaction, I know self-harm is very scary and difficult for people to understand.I have a couple of close friends with daughters that I could ask for advice about this, but I don't have anyone in my life that I've ever discussed cutting with before, so I don't know if I want to expose my past distress and terrible times to these people.Does anyone in this community have any advice for me?
I put a bandaid on it so i can hide it so it looks like it was a nic accident from shaving. i did it without really thinking. i think i'm starting to go back to my old ways again. 
So I tend to bump my head on things. Usually it's walls, and one time I busted a coffee mug on my forehead, but it tends to be quite loud. Well tonight, I learned that 'The Joy of Cooking' makes an excellent substitute for a wall while the wife is asleep. Well you see, this leave me in somewhat of a pickle. I feel much better immediately following a rightly flogging, but for much longer I am left with a headache and a stiff neck. All jokes aside though, I am starting to realize this behavior to be self harm. Realizing tonight that I could simply beat myself with a softcover edition of my favorite cookbook instead of waking up the neighbors.. seems sketchy. Seems like I might have a few more bruises in my future if I don't get this sorted out. My question is, how do I bring this up to my therapist without getting committed. I want to be candid, but not at the cost of ending up on an involuntary psychiatric hold. Honestly, it's not worth it to me to fix if it means I end up in a hospital. Better off Ted.
This is my first time reaching out to an online community about my emotional issues. Yet, there is no where else I can turn to. I am a 25 year old woman who is in a great relationship with a 31 year old man and he is taking the brunt of it all. I'm not certain as to how my self-harming gets triggered, but I think it must have to do with the feeling of losing control. Or not feeling like you have any control to begin with. It's frustrating and confusing because when I'm in the middle of a self-harm episode, my boyfriend always thinks I'm doing it to get what I want. He may be right. But I never think ahead (but maybe my head does?). All I know is, I self harm when this feeling deep inside of my brain won't stop hurting and pressuring me. I'm not sure why, but it feels good to hurt myself in order to get that feeling to stop. But the hurt doesn't stop there. At times, the feelings of hurt, confusion, frustration and anger all come out and aim to hurt my boyfriend. I've physically hit him before. The first time, I was horrified at my actions and how if the situation was reversed, he would go to jail for it. But because it's me and him, he deals with it. He has never hit me back, but I constantly badger him to. I want to fight him. I want to make him hurt me. When he doesn't, I have to hurt me. I know I need help. I'm on depression medication right now that has been helping. I used to go see a therapist, but recently found a job that has me working during their office hours. But to be honest, I've done all of that. And I've pin-pointed my usual rage and self-hurt to a week before my period starts. And there seems to be nothing I can really do besides just endure this horrible time between us. Most of the time, I'm a good person. Things don't seem to bother me as much. But around my period, I expect things a certain way. When they are not to my liking, I lash out. But I don't lash out to just anyone-it has to be to the closest person I love. I don't like being mean in front of others. This last time, I made my boyfriend spend time with me by coming over and sleeping next to me. He did it because it would stop my self-harm. But once he reminded me the next morning that he had to get going because he had plans with friends, I was mortified. He was supposed to be with me because I'm sick and feeling awful. He was supposed to comfort me. I threw him out of my place and threatened his life every five seconds through text. What's wrong with me? Why is there so much rage? Where is this all coming from? Can I just take a pill to make it all go away? 
Hey friends!Though you Internet-friends are great and all, my real-life friends saw my arms tonight. Now, my arms look like a personal landmark, if you catch my drift, but as the night came to an end, my friends happened the see the' my way of coping with life.' Sure, I got the whole, "here for you" bullshit from them. This has been a rough week for me, I have fucked up a lot of school work (my last semester too), relapsed into 'our' world, and I learned Monday that I am basically a "shoe-in for bipolar disorder."  My friends want me to get better and think my habit is bad for me, awful, etc.. The odd, and maybe scary, part is that a part of me doesn't want to get better. It is such a powerful way of "burying" those problems (I am still not sure what they are). Regardless, I was doing minus a few drinks,  But when my friends saw, I had to just run that knife across. Was it for them, was it for me, or both? I don't know anymore. Why can't they just leave me be? I know they are 'concerned' but they don't understand. Of course, I always get compared to,"X  had this, Y had to do this, My Z did..." Why can't people just leave us alone? Sure, they are concerned, but why does no one care until we hit rock-bottom? Fuck'em they are here for the fall or not all.
I have struggled with depression and various self harm for several years. My 'favorite' method was always just berating myself for any mistake big or small, then I would usually scratch myself until I was raw and started bleeding. One such time I did this was about 2 years ago when I drove to work but stopped to get gas. I managed to lock my keys in my car and had to call my mother to come unlock it for me. This is an important instance because while I was harming myself for a simple mistake that many people make, and my mom was on her way to me, my boyfriend was on the couch with my dad asking his permission to marry me. We have since gotten married and of course I have had other episodes like this. I have always been hard on myself. Just this week my husband was out of town and our dog got out of the house. The usual happened, while I went looking for him, I blamed myself and berated myself for letting it happen. Only later that night (after the dog was found and home safe) did I realize, that not once did I think about physically harming myself. While I realize I still have a long way to go in learning to forgive myself, I made a huge step without even noticing. Hopefully through the love and support of my family and the continual counsel from my therapist, I will be able to get to that next step. Thank you for allowing me to share.
I honestly never thought I would get this far!! 90% of my scars have faded and the ones I still have are way less noticeable than before.If I can do it I know all of you can.Just stay strong <3
i cut myself to feel "normal". without self harming, i either get these goddamn intrusive thoughts of terrible things, or nowadays i feel empty and can only feel apathy. even though last year my parents found out about my self harm, i still get tempted to cut myself, take yesterday for example as I used a razor to cut at my shin. it doesnt help that the natural supplements i take to stop my depression anxiety just make me feel dull, empty, and i feel like i dont care about anything or anybody or that I'm selfish when i refuse to believe thats true, i fucking hate feeling like that, i cant have a normal conversation with someone without sounding like a manipulative asshole. sorry I'm rambling i guess the point of this post is to vent about my self harming problems, and why i do it.
My therapist wants to try eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, minus the eye movement part (she uses something else, i think little electric pulses on hands or something). From what was described, it seems like this is going to be a pretty intense process. Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm very nervous talking about things as is, so I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to handle this. I posted this here too because I'd like someone to respond, so I'm hopefully increasing the amount of people who will see this.
It's been ~4 years since I last cut.  This year I have been working and living in a very isolated way, in an anxiety-inducing city.  I'm alone all the time despite the crowds.  This job is not bad, and it's very important career-wise that I follow it through to the end of the thing we are doing.  Objectively, I'd be a fool to do anything else.  But I live alone, and work alone too (No co-workers and a minimally present boss).  It's taken a while for me to really feel the depths of this isolation, but after I got switched to night hours at work it has become very clear.  The schedule has thrown me, I am not good at utilizing my time well, and I'm losing what's left of my outside life to the darkness.  Anyway TLDR I'm trying to find meaningful ways to fill my solitude, but I fail so often and each wasted hour weighs heavier on me.  I just want to leave.  I didn't think about it for ages, but as others have said here, damn it can be tempting to go back to old habits.  Right now the only reason, the best reason that I don't is my girlfriend.  I'm good at secrets, but I don't have it in me to lie to her.  I guess as long as I don't cut I feel like I'm still fighting back.  This isn't a 'so I'll keep fighting' or a 'but I'm done now'.  I dunno.  I'm new here.
i havent self harmed in almost 2 full yearsi just found out one of my best friends was in a fatal car crashit is taking all my energy to not cut myself right nowi dont know what to do
There isn't much else to it, I just feel good. That's not good, is it?
After years of trying to make myself worse I want to get better. Will I ever feel I deserve to get better?
I've been self harming for about 11 years. It's been on and off, and I even went a couple years where I barely self harmed at all. It's always been a struggle for me, though. Sometimes I get caught in slumps and everything leaves me wanting to self harm.I've tried "quitting" on several occasions, sometimes on purpose, and sometimes by accident. In the last two years, my longest streak was three months without. I was trying very hard before I gave up.At this current point in my life, I have a lot of things I am struggling with going on. I hate the person I let myself become. I feel like a failure.Yesterday, I found a post on reddit that my girlfriend posted looking for relationship advice. She told them she can't share her feelings with me because I take everything to heart and end up cutting myself. She also feels like she's babying me because of my social anxiety, and she's upset I won't go to therapy.I really didn't realize she felt this way. My heart is broken. Now, being the way that I am, all I want to do it self harm because I feel like a horrible, selfish girlfriend. I'm scared she's going to leave me and never even try to talk to me about it.But I haven't self harmed yet, because I feel like I'll just be proving her right. I actually rarely self harm because of things she says, instead my motives are my self worth, my social anxiety, and my stress levels. But I guess it's hard for her to see it that way because she's not inside my head.I don't know what to do. I don't want my self harm to come between us, I love her more than anything. But I'm struggling. I'm considering approaching the counseling options at my school, since we can't actually afford therapy, but I'm terrified. Also, should I address this post that I found? She created a new account just to post it, so I'm sure she didn't want me to see it. Should I just try to better myself without letting her know I found it?I don't want to do this anymore.
...in practice for later. Stupid thing isn't sharp enough. Just leaves a mere scratch.I've never been one for scarring because people will notice but now I guess I'll have to wear sleeves or somethingI feel so hopeless
I started cutting way back in 2012. The worst of it was over around mid 2013. Up until, I have been cutting very few. However I have recently started doing it again. I have no idea how to make it go away for good. I just constantly feel this need to put new scars on my skin. 
I haven't cut for 4 years, but I still find my self muttering to myself that I'm going to cut my self when I make a mistake. Or I will just run my nails over the spot. It's just amazing how addictive that sensation is. 
My gums are tingling and aching to be slit. It's like they're throbbing with agitation to be cut. Like an itch I can't scratch. Solutions?
She was clean for about 5 years, late last year she started up again when he depression kicked up and her meds stopped working. She is currently seeking professional help and changing meds which has its own issues of course...i am hoping i can get some advice for one part though...every time we have a fight (usually a minor cause, or me not dealing with her illness) she will hide away, not talk to me all day, and when she comes back to herself, she has fresh cuts on her legs. Can anyone help me understand this? help me at all? 
I first started self harming when i was 15. It was bad. I would only wear long sleeved shirts. I had band aids on both of my wrists. I wore a wrist band on both wrists with a rubber band to hold it in place. I self harmed at one point every other day for months. I'd get this tunnel vision where i only could think of the sadness i felt. I really only had my one best friend that knew at that point. My best friend told my science teacher who i am thankful to this day for confronting me about it in private. She had me go to the school guidance counselor. Then a few more 'friends' well girls that i thought were my friends found out what i was doing and some got mad, some said i was doing it for attention. Things got worse before they got better. from then till i was 18 i just went on a downward spiral. I won't go into details but i was in the hospital for a week. After that i started self harming less and less. it started with once a week... once a month..once every two or three months... I still have the occasional rough day but i've learned safe alternatives. Safe ways to cope. Journal writing was one of the main things that helped me over the years. when i was really struggling in my late teens i'd write some times pages of just venting anger and frustration. the more i wrote the better i felt because it was off of my chest. as i self harmed less and less i wrote more. Somewhat of a back story (bullied at home and school growing up. parents divorced. stepfather picked on me. cyber bullied. disabled). I never thought i'd live to see 21. But now i'm 32. The scars from my teens are still there. faded and white. But i know now how to fight those demons. i know how it feels. for me it was like.. i felt so much hurt and anger and i didn't want to talk to others about it or take it out on anyone else..so i expressed that anger at myself. But counseling helped. Music helped a lot. Bands can be very inspirational and something to find joy in. Find a hobby. a creative outlet for your sadness. Trust..when i was really struggling with self harm as a teen i felt like i had no one. My best friend knew but was disappointed in me. my family didn't know. I didn't have a boyfriend. When i was in the counselors office i felt fine but when i'd go home and be around my family that wasn't always a 'positive' environment. that's when things got difficult. But things do get better. Find a passion. Find a creative outlet. Help others.
So, yesterday my boyfriend convinced me to throw away my razor. And honestly good or him, because I never would have been able to do that on my own. But I'm not sure how to function without having that form of release if I need it. The high levels of stress that have been pertinent lately aren't helping much either. It's gotten to the level of having multiple panic attacks a day. Not fun. So I feel like I have to do SOMETHING. If I can't cut then it has to be something else, and the only way I know how to cope is to be destructive. I figured starving (or close to it) would be a decent way to go since its equally as uncomfortable, and I'd get to lose some weight in the process. My boyfriend, however, doesn't see how it could be a good thing, and maybe he's right. I don't know.  I don't know what to do, or how to cope, or deal with any of this. I just don't want to feel this way anymore.  But hey, what's a girl to do? 
I'm never going to selfharm again in the form of cutting, ive punched myself but that's as far as I've taken it in almost 2 weeks. I feel confident in saying I wont cut again. I just need to know why do triggers suck all the happieness, joy, hope motivation away so fast and strong. its like I can be on top of the world and see a trigger and just go back to that place so fast
So yeah, the title says most of it. The thing is I've been in a DBT treatment program in Atlanta since the end of October. I've not drank or gotten high the whole time and I never self harmed until now. I was in  residential, but recently moved out to IOP and transitional housing. I slept in two days in a row last week, felt awful about it and thus started hating myself just a little bit more.Over the week it progressed and compounded because I never attending to the feelings, I just kept shoving them down and down and pretending like I was ok. Friday and Saturday my friends ditched me and I sat alone at my computer the whole time, only getting more lonely and more depressed by the hour.It all finally culminated on sunday night when I was talking to my friend about her "problems" with guys shes meeting on match. She has tons of guys fawning all over her and her "problem" is that she can't decide who to go with. Meanwhile here I am, single for over five years with only one partner in that whole time and lonelier than I've ever been before. Being trans, I find that most women are immediately turned off from me. I've met so many people who just don't believe that I really am a Trans woman who's interested in women, they always just say I'm some kind of freak or I must really be into guys and unable to admit it.I'm sick and tired of being alone, I'm sick and tired of the god damn emotional rollercoaster I ride every week. I have both Bipolar 2 and BPD so my emotions are always intense and always feel like they are the worst they've ever been and will last forever. DBT is helping, but only so much. I wish I could know that killing myself would benefit this world, but I can't so I don't because I don't want to hurt anyone. Cutting though, cutting just hurts myself, and it feels so god damn good.I don't know what to do anymore, ever since I cut I've wanted to even more and more, it really is an addiction. I'm barely holding on, and that's even with TIPP skills.
I haven't done it in a few months but I can't stop thinking about it. Won't be a lot just 2 small ones I'm sorry if that's two graphic for the sub I've never posted. I feel hopeless.
It was an obsessive thought I had for a few days and I didn't have the distraction of online games to keep me from thinking about it.It still stings a little but it's a good sting. It needed to be done. but the urge to cut myself hasnt gone away. I still want to do it...maybe on my arms this time, or my legs again.I deserve to hurt sometimes...
It was helpful to talk to my teacher, and its looking up, but I'm terrified now my Mum knows. The teacher told her and I'm really nervous about talking to her. Does anyone have advice?
Apologies for the wall of text, but I'll start with the background info in case it helps anyone. For anonymity, I'll change the names of the main people involved. Let’s call the person cutting herself Leah, my best friend will be Chris, and Leah's boyfriend will be Matt (whom none of us other than Leah have met).So a mutual friend of ours introduced Leah to Chris and I back in October of last year. We became really close friend really fast because our personalities really clicked. All of us are gamers and usually play and talk every day, but she lives in another state so I've never met her in person. Leah has had a long distance relationship for about a year with Matt, who is a college student in New Zealand. Because of the time zone difference, they can't talk much so they talk through skype messages or video chat at like 3 am. However, Leah has low self-confidence and anxiety, so she is often concerned that she is annoying or a shitty girlfriend for Matt. Whenever Matt doesn't respond to her within a day or two, she either gets super worried about him or thinks that he doesn't want to talk to her anymore.So about a month and a half ago, Chris and Leah had a private chat because Leah was having thoughts about cutting herself. I knew they had a private chat, but they lied about what they talked about when I asked Chris later. Last night, our main squad were talking on our voip server and one of the topics that came up was Leah's relationship with Matt. Matt had gotten drunk the night before and revealed to Leah that Matt's brother had died in a drug deal gone wrong long before he met Leah. Apparently Matt's bother was shot twice and Matt held him in his arms as he died. He became really depressed and cut himself as a result (which he no longer does, according to Leah). When Leah told this to us last night, I told her it didn't make sense that Matt would cut himself. I explained to everyone the science behind what happens when you cut yourself and why it didn't make sense unless Matt felt that he was to blame for his brother's death. After we all got off for the night, Leah cried for an hour and cut herself.She confided this with Chris this morning, presumably because Chris had also cut himself many years ago. She told him that she thinks that she’s "a fucking awful girlfriend and can't do anything right" which is why she cried and cut herself. The worst part is that she said it worked, and she thinks she wants to do it again. Our talk where I explained cutting last night probably set her down that path, but there wasn't really a way I could have known that was something she considered. Anyways, right before Matt met Leah, he was in an emotionally abusive relationship, and it feels like he is using Leah as a fuck buddy and a way to forget about his ex. Leah said she believes this to be true, but doesn't care because she genuinely loves him and just wants to be the best possible girlfriend because she just wants him to be happy. To put this in perspective, for Christmas she spent $100 to send him a box full of American snacks, candies, love notes, and some clothing she knit for him. However, he doesn't seem to reciprocate nearly as much affection or attention as Leah gives to him. Whenever Matt does compliment her, she tells me and is absolutely glowing with happiness. However, those moments are far and few in between, so a result she is in constant self-doubt and hates herself. From what Leah tells me, Matt doesn't seem like a bad guy but he just doesn't seem like a good match for what Leah needs in a relationship. Because Chris and I have been best friends for about 15 years, we share pretty much everything and this morning he told me the truth about their private conversation a month ago and that Leah cut herself despite Leah's wishes to keep it private. Since she is one of my closest friends, I'm naturally concerned about it and want to help her. However, when I subtly probed this afternoon to see if she would tell me herself, she didn't. This is where my predicament is.So as of right now, Leah doesn't know that Chris told me about the cutting and she doesn't seem to want me to know. However, she has told me pretty much everything about her relationship with Matt. It's also worth noting that Chris and I have suggested for a while that she end things with Matt for her own emotional wellbeing, but she really, really doesn't want to break up. I've looked up ways to help Leah, but because of our distance and Leah not wanting me to know, most of the suggestions I've read aren't really possible, although finding an alternative to cutting seems like a pretty good idea. I've also considered bringing Matt into this (AFAIK he doesn't know) and trying to get him to be more affectionate/attentive to Leah, but finding a way to contact him without Leah knowing would be hard.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated, but I'd prefer to maintain the status quo unless absolutely necessary, so any advice you give will probably have to be relayed through Chris. Thanks for all your help.
My thighs are deeply scarred from years of cutting and I'm super ashamed of them. It's still a while away, but I would like to be comfortable enough with them to be able to wear shorts in the summer. I'm working with treatments to help fade the scars but they are so dark that i'm not expecting much.for those who were able overcome their fear of showing their scars, how did you do it?
I have been punching my legs lately and have been planning a way to kill myself. I was going to wait until March 2nd to do so. Giving me a month to think about it. I thought I was recovering, I don't want to seem like a failure to her. I use to study and work but now I don't do these things... I have also been considering cutting again. I am also scared if I tell her all this she will put me in a mental hospital against my will, can she do that?. What should I do?
I'm just here to talk to you about your problems. I understand if you don't want to share it with a stranger on the internet but I feel that I might be some use to this world and help others. :)
Part of me wants to be taken seriously, and part of me thinks that I'm in imposter and what I'm doing isn't actually severe enough to be classified as self-harm. I do know I am definitely, willfully hurting myself. But I have a couple of other issues that (at the moment) are affecting me more, so I probably should bring those up instead, but it took me months to get this bloody appointment.I'm scared and I don't know what of.*edit follows*Well. That went badly. Dismissive of the extent of the harming. Said that it didn't really qualify as self-harm, except to the extent that I was self-sabotaging. Told me my acne was just acne (it's not, a bump appears and I make it ten times worse by repeatedly pulling myself to pieces) and decided what I needed was a prescription for that. Gave me said prescription. When I tried to bring up one of the other issues, I was told that the time for the appointment was done with (really? Ten minutes gone like that?) and that I could make another. To be fair, he did give me some info for a mental health group, but I did mention depression and it did feel like I was being palmed off.He saw me late and it took him five minutes, if that, to dismiss what I was feeling and how badly it was affecting me. It took me four fucking months to get this appointment.Fuck everything.
I only plan to use them if my boyfriend dies or leaves me. 
Ok so i have just slit my wrists and its been a few hours they are light but i can notice them and i dont want my mum to find out how can i make them go they are not deep i didnt bleed or anything it was with a math compass help me i dont want these to stay it was so stupid of me to do this
As the title says, I want to stop hurting myself. I got out of hospital a few days ago after a pretty dark time and I'm feeling surprisingly okay (besides tired as hell). I'm going to be starting to see a therapist fairly soon I think, but I want to make my own progress. I can still feel the urge to do it in the back of my mind. Sorry if this is a little vague, but I'm just looking for some advice on where to start after doing it for so long. 
been self harming seriously since 12 or so. Scars all up both arms, some deep enough that they are half an inch wide. I counted once, a year ago, over two hundred scars and there are more now.   I wear long sleeves all the time. I didn't go on holiday in case my parents saw my arms.  I want to tell them. I'm twenty, at uni, and every time I think I want to tell them, life gets in the way. Couldn't ruin my mum's birthday with the news, couldn't ruin Christmas, and I'm terrified that they would lock away all the knives. Or lock me up.  I've tried to kill myself a few times, I have a drinking problem and an eating disorder. They know none of this. They are traditional Conservatives, fairly dismissive of mental illness, and they would be so upset that it's been so long and I didn't tell them.  Anyone have any hints? My mum will cry. Sometimes I think I will just wear long sleeves forever. The scars will never fade. Thanks hope you're all well
I just feel like people hate me online. Like no matter what i post people are bothered by me. 
Hi All,I am a 23 year old male with no history of self harm. I am in a relatively high stress PhD program, and I have been struggling with anxiety attacks lately. Last night, I got blackout drunk and I guess I cut myself several times on my hand and once on my wrist. I've thrown away everything I could use to do this again, and will not be drinking for a long time.I had thought about hurting myself a few weeks before. I'm lucky that I'm not really hurt, but I am really embarrassed by my cuts. Hell, I have to teach a class on monday in front of a big group of folks. I am seeing a therapist but the thought of this affecting my education causes a lot of anxiety.Have folks been in similar situations?
I told her a while back and we tried a few things to get me to stop. I've been cutting less and less, but it still happens. She doesn't check to see if I'm still cutting and I can tell it makes her uncomfortable.
i found that eating spicy food helps me control my cutting urges. it releases similar chemicals into your brain and it seems pretty low risk. if you can handle spicy stuff, i think this is a good alternative. pickled jalapeno slices are pretty cheap, and that's what i've been eating. just don't eat too many in one sitting.
I recently cut again after not doing so for a few months. I haven't done it since but it made me feel a lot better mentally, although I did regret it a little. I'm trying hard to not do it again. So far, so good. I also have some advice. >Please, don't hurt yourself anymore. Your body loves you, and you should love it back. Your body is doing its best to protect you. Cuts scab over so you don't bleed to death, bruises heal, burns heal..your body doesn't want you to die. As much as your mind thinks "Oh, well that's just its job to keep me alive," I believe it's also your minds job to keep you alive. You may not think so, but you are definitely here for a reason. You just have to stay alive long enough to know that you do, indeed, have a purpose. I see it as you having a demon in your head that tells you lie after you and you soon begin to believe it. Please, don't hurt your body. It's not good for you or those around you that love you. 
Could really use some encouragement or words of cheer. My thyroid has been extremely hypo which has been messing with me pretty bad. I’m seeing the doctor on tuesday due to symptoms getting way worse. It feels like someone has sucked all the joy, happiness and energy out of me. I saw my therapist yesterday and have plans to talk to a friend tonight but in the mean time the thoughts of hurting myself among other darker thoughts have been on repeat. I have no desire to act on them yet and am trying to hold out as long as I can. I’m not used to feeling this void and drained of emotion. I’m not used to the bleakness that’s left when all the happiness is gone. I know i’ve talked to a lot of you on here before and every once in a while i’ll get a kind message but tonight I could really use some. 
I was supposed to go out to hang with a friend on their birthday. I don't get many "hey you wanna hang?"'s so I got really excited to go and got ready and everything and then 4 hours later they're like, "I'm sorry I can't go, my family has a party for me" and now, because I told my family I'd be out and they were super psyched about me going out, I'm hiding in my bathroom with the lights off until he goes out to a bar so my dad (who just got home) will believe I'm actually hanging out with someone. It's these kinds of things that make me kinda rethink why I stopped cutting... even though they couldn't help the surprise party (it's their birthday) and it's in NO WAY their fault, I still feel like a friendless shit to have to hide from my family so they'll think I have friends. So they'll be happy for me instead of sorry for me. So they won't think I'm going to forever be a recluse or friendless. I feel pathetic.
21, transman, 20mg Citalopram daily, anxiety disorder, history of depression. Substance abuse and debt run in my family.  some shitty things happened tonight that triggered a bunch of stuff, like, kind of--I don't know, kicking a brick out from the bottom of a pyramid. Stuff that's been building just exploded.  I haven't cut for a year at least, and I've had several close shaves, but tonight is the hardest. I can't get high, I can't get drunk, and I live in the ghetto so I can't go for a walk. I'm too tired to draw or write. My mom got so drunk she fell down when she came home tonight before being rude and angry at me for trying to help, so my main support in her isn't available. My younger sister is not answering her phone. If I call the crisis center it will just. fuck. everything up.  It would be so easy and simple to use the box cutter I had to get for class and just bleed my way out of feeling like a piece of garbage. I contribute nothing to anything, I am not extraordinary in any way, I get in the way, I cost money. everyone would be better off if I were dead
I'm genuinely curious, why does cutting make me feel good? I've only done it two times as of now, nothing serious I guess, but after each time I always feel a little bit better. Not the cutting itself, mind you, but after it. I don't know why. Why? I'm afraid to tell anyone because of how they might react.
I've had a big problem with depression for years and I just cut for the first time last week. Then recently I started to want to do it more. I found out it could be a heavy addiction and I was too scared to do it more, but I still have urges.Is there a way I could talk to someone online without them knowing personal info/coming to my house? (I'm 15 btw)
It helps and makes me feel better if I'm depressed. Why is it bad ?
I started cutting recently. Im 32m with Bipolar I. I really dont understand it. It kinda hurts, more warm than anything. It feels euphoric. I told my therapist this, my pdoc knows as well.  The suicidal thoughts are less intense after cutting. My therapist seems to think that it has become a substitute for SI. I am so unsure about what to think about it all.
We are both juniors at a pretty competitive high school, they got their first B yesterday. Pretty intense reaction... I think them realizing that their reaction was pretty "dramatic" (as they put it) might have driven them over the edge a bit more. They mentioned to me that they sometimes take 10-15 pills when they are suffering from depression and boredom at the start of the year for self harm purposes. (you cannot get high off it, it just hurts a lot) This struck me as a problem... but I had just started hanging out with them a lot so I did not feel in a position to do a ton. (plus that number was "just" unhealthy) But last night... we were both comparing our grades and suddenly they snapchat me a picture of a little over 50 pills. (They told me 52) We go back and forth for a while... I basically ask them if they are safe, ask them to stay safe, ask them if they are doing alright, etc. They seem to appreciate that I am concerned but we keep on going in a cycle where I ask if they are still ok and they basically apologize for putting me through this. I do some research on the DL and see that the amount they are taking is 1/4 of what you need to potentially die from overdose... so I at least know at that point that it would be overkill to actually call a poison/suicide number. We get to the point where I straight up ask them if they are basically asking for immediate help... and they tell me no, this is a more gradual thing. They are looking for "organ failure, not to die tonight."So... I am under 18 and I know I need to get in touch with someone because there is not a whole lot I can do to help them. I have a lot of friends struggling with self-harm, but I am in no position to assist on the regular. So... are the parents who to contact first? They reacted horribly last time she self harmed in 8th grade, like cut off her phone access and barely let her out of the house. It made things way worse for a while. To make it worse they are divorced now. Are there any other options or should I just go for it and email them? TL;DR- friend's self-harm through ibuprofen has been escalating, they still have not contacted anyone else about this than me (to my knowledge), the only adults I know to contact are their divorced parents who did not handle the issue in the most sensitive way last time... what is the most responsible and efficient way to deal with this? 
Hey guys,I wrote an article about my recovery from depression/self harm/eating disorders and how getting a massage and letting my body be seen was a big step for me. I wanted to share it with you all and hear your thoughts. TW for some descriptions and an illustration with self-harm. [Getting A Massage Shifted My Relationship With My Body](http://www.buzzfeed.com/lesleym4dda93cdf/im-learning-to-take-care-of-my-body-instead-of-trying-to-fix#.goZ388YA89)
I started self-harming while I was in an abusive relationship. I was in such a dark place then. After I broke up with that person, I was able to stop cutting/scratching myself and haven't done it for at least 7 years.Now I'm married, and I just found out last week that my husband cheated on me. I've never been more hurt. I keep wondering what's wrong with me that I keep finding these men that hurt me so badly. And all I want to do is just cut huge pieces off myself. I want to cut away everything about me that is bad and awful and makes people treat me like trash. And if nothing's left then that's kind of okay with me right now.Luckily I'm too much of a weenie to even make super deep cuts much less cut anything off, but I do cut deep enough to leave scars and I really don't need any more. Any words of support or advice would be so welcome.

i've been clean for over 28 months now but every damn day i want to cut myself. i can't even look at a knife or scissors or even something like a needle without the urge to cut myself open. i've gotten to the point where i'm literally holding the blade to my stomach but i haven't done it. and i want to, i really fucking want to, but it'd be 28 months down the drain again.i don't really know why i'm posting this but if anyone who's been clean for a long time has any advice for dealing with the urge to relapse it'd be appreciatedeta: i really appreciate everything. i have very little energy to respond but just know it's appreciated
I used to hit myself - still do on occasion. But one day summer, after a rather painful breakup, I looked at myself in the mirror and saw nothing more than a fat, bloated carcass - ugly and unwanted. Hitting myself wasn't doing it for me, I needed something more. Almost whimsically, I figured that since I didn't like what I saw in the mirror - and I can guarantee no one else does either - the least I could do is make sure I'm good enough looking for an open casket funeral. So I walked to the park next door and started running. I didn't even change into something more exercise-ready, I just kept running - ignoring the burning in my chest and the ache in my legs. I just ran until I finally keeled over and threw up in a nearby bush.And that was the start of it. Since then whenever I feel like hurting myself, I exercise. I can barely type this as last night I did push-ups until my arms gave out and just lay weeping on the floor, helpless and pathetic.I took a run on my lunch break today and a coworker told me to take it easy before I hurt myself.But inwardly I'm thinking "Isn't that the point?"I have no weight loss or fitness goals. I'm not trying out for a marathon or Spartan Run. I couldn't care less about being thin - no one found me attractive as a 190lb twink either. But figure dying while exercising looks a lot better on an obituary than found in a room surrounded by empty pizza boxes and cats.
I recently started seeing a councilor and I already feel like giving up. She tells me I'm putting to much pressure on myself and I should wait till I have better coping skills before I push myself. But that's bullshit, if I can't push then I'm weak.
Please help our new organization get off the ground! https://fundly.com/to-write-love-on-her-arms-iowa-stateTo Write Love on Her Arms is a non-profit movement dedicated to hope and finding help for people struggling with depression, self-injury, and suicide.
Hi there!Want to help other people understand self-injury?Right now, very little is known about what leads people to self-injure on a day-to-day basis. The Personality and Emotion Research Lab (PERL), a research team from Simon Fraser University in Canada, is conducting a study to learn more about the experiences of people who self-harm, and we want your help! We are interested in how emotions, life experiences, thoughts, and coping styles affect non-suicidal self-injury. We hope that this research will help other people understand more about why people self-injure and what they can do to help.What you can do: If you want to participate in this confidential study, you will answer questions about self-injury, emotions, and life events. This study consists of 2 main components: 1) One-time, online questionnaires (approx. 1.5 hours) 2) Brief daily online questionnaires for 14 daysWho can participate: We are looking for people, age 19 or older, who live in North America, and are currently self-harming (whether you are trying to stop or not), and have self-harmed more than once within the last month.What’s in it for you: Individuals who choose to participate will receive a $10 online gift card in appreciation for completing part 1 of this study. Participants will receive an additional $20 gift card for completing the daily questionnaires. Furthermore, participants will receive an extra $5 if they complete the questionnaires on at least 6 out of 7 days, for each week. Therefore, participants will receive between $20 and $30 in part 2 of this study, and a total of $30 to $40 as appreciation for completing the entire study. Additionally, telling us about your experiences will give us important information on what leads to self-injury on a day-to-day basis, and could help develop and improve treatments for people who want to stop self-injuring. Individual participants will never be identified in the results of this research.Please contact us at knwalter@sfu.ca if you are interested in participating or if you have any questions. Please include only the answers to the following questions (do not restate the questions):1) When was the last time you injured yourself (e.g., cut, burned, or scratched) on purpose, without intending to die? Please answer in the following format - DAY/MONTH/YEAR2) Approximately how many times in the past month have you deliberately injured yourself (e.g., cut, burned or scratched yourself on purpose) without intending to die?Thank you, Personality and Emotion Research Laboratory Simon Fraser University
I honestly apologize if this is a trigger to anyone... but I *need* to let this out. I used to self harm, and I quit and I haven't done it in a while, more than a few months. My anxiety and depression are getting worse, and my pills don't help much at all. I've cut/carved, burned, pinched, bit, bruised, and scratched myself before and I recently scratched. I need the release. I feel like I can't get it any other way. I need help. I *miss doing it*... I don't know what else to do. It's almost the only thing I've been thinking about for a month or two now and I can't get it out of my head. 
I recently had to go the hospital for a cut, which I've never had to do before. I realized I was cutting for scars, not cutting to cope, and it really scared me. I had such a close call and I was terrified. I can't do this to myself or the people around me anymore. I've been a cutter for over 5 years and I've never gone longer than one month without cutting, so it's going to be really hard. Do you guys have any techniques or distraction methods I should try out? I'm making a distraction / comfort box today, and I'm going to invest in some red food coloring and an ice cube tray, but I'm stumped aside from that. I really don't want to do this anymore. Thank you in advance (: 
This is behaviour I engaged in five years ago. I am no longer this person but the weirdness and sheer waste of what I did haunts me.I'm putting it on here, along with a few thoughts I've had over the years of what alternative routes to pursue for people who find themselves in a similar head space.I'd made some foolish decisions in my late teens. I really hated myself, because of that or maybe unrelated. That isn't so risky in itself perhaps, yet, in my case this was coupled with a kind of reckless abandon--purposeful, deliberate seeking of the worst possible scenarios. This was my emotional self-harm. I was 20, very pretty, there was a fairly decent guy who was into me, but I deliberately wanted to be with someone who was a bad person in every respect. I succeeded in this. I bragged to one of my friends that I wanted to "hit rock bottom". The relationship was a very abusive, traumatic one. This person I was seeing is not someone I would ever associate with even as a friend or in any other capacity normally. It ended thankfully in a few months. I didn't think that it would traumatise me as badly as it did; yet, it did.I was traumatised for years. Feeling afraid of this person, having nightmares, screaming in my sleep. I felt physically sick when I thought of the purposelessness of what I had inflicted on myself, its horribleness.So going back to a few thoughts on what characteristed my headspace-1. A desire to inflict deliberate pain, sadness, humiliation, difficulty and adversity on myself. To make things much harder than they were already2. A profound hatred of myself.3. Paradoxically, also a sense of being superhuman-thinking that whatever extreme harm I did to myself I could come out of it, totally and completely unscathed. 4. Not caring or thinking about the future implications of my actions.5. Taking a perverse delight in my own downfall, humiliation, suffering.6. Thinking of self-harm as something cool.What alternatives can be pursued by those who find themselves in a similar situation:Try to focus on the very real, very sickening aftermath of episodes of self-harm. The pain does not go away. Ever. It gets dull with age. You have to very violently suppress the bad stuff so you can be functional.It isn't cool or glamorous. Cliched as it is, you lose a bit of your soul. You become sad, very, very pathologically sad.It creates further grounds for you to hate yourself even more. Get running or find another way to work out. The good hormones generated will help. Just. Don't.Wait a few days. The instinct will pass.Absorb yourself in your job, or your study, or whatever.don't let this take up your mindspaceExpress your feelings of self-hatred or recklessness or unstability through another medium,It is safer to dress emo than to act it.Paint or rip things or smash glasses.These things are ultimately objects that you can buy more of, as opposed to doing something so pervasive it stays with you the rest of your life.Travel, write a blog, start a death metal band. All of these are legitimate expressions. Something very beautiful can come out of your pain. Love yourself. If you don't, then at least get on the path to it. Find actionable items that will help you to gain more esteem in your own eyes, and then do them.
Have been self harming by cutting for five years, quit this autumn, had a relapse two days ago. Also had a relapse in between, where I almost died. This time though, instead of cutting, I just hit my hand till it bruised, hit myself and drew all over my arm with red ink. Can I count it as progress? I feel like it is, because I'm mostly self harm free, I used to cut a lot so to go from that to being clean but relapsing now and then should be a positive thing, but I'm scared its just bad that I self harmed at all, that all my progress, all the months clean has been for nothing. I don't trust my own thoghts on this
But lately the urges have been relentless. I know I'm strong enough to get through this, but it's so hard to sustain my willpower. Cutting would be so much easier. There's a cacophony in my head, and if I cut myself I know that it would shut up all the (figurative) voices and I could breathe again, at least for a few minutes. The storm always comes back and ultimately cutting makes it worse, but I'm craving that instant of peace and clarity that comes with the bite of the knife.  I have a good support network of compassionate and understanding people who want to help me, and that makes this easier to bear. But I'm carrying so much turmoil around right now that it's hard to keep it in, and I don't want to unleash its full weight on the people I care about. I'm tempted to withdraw, but I know that the most dangerous place for me right now is alone in my room. I guess all I can do for now is keep on breathing.  Thanks for letting me vent; I'm glad this community exists, and I'm sorry if I've triggered anyone.
I was trying really hard to calm down and I slipped up. Bit my forearms and hit my thigh. Thank god there wasn't anything sharp nearby. I got so fucking pissed because I couldn't do the thing I needed right *that second* to calm down (my earbuds went missing, then I found out my boyfriend had set the board I use for doing big art pieces under the bench at the end of the bed in a way that it can't be removed without moving the bed itself. I moved it enough to reach under the bed on that side and at the light touch of my face on the bed, my glasses snap.)It's really scary when this happens... I get a lot of moodswings with my anxiety/depression combination. It feels like I'm forced into a tantrum, like there is only avoiding it and there's no way out of it once it starts. Is there any way to stop the roller coaster once it's going? I feel it coming and there's some things I do as self care-mostly blasting music in my earbuds while doing art for a few hours and just FORCING everything out of my head with art. But obviously it doesn't always work. 
Been going through a lot these past 2 weeks. Mother literally told my sister not to bother respecting me, because mother felt I showed disrespect through leaving a box of rice out overnight. Been at BF's for almost 2 weeks straight, and tonight sister says I need to move out now because she doesn't deserve the way I treat her and no one wants me here.(I don't treat her badly, fyi. She's both physically and emotionally abusive to me, so I avoid her at all costs)With the intense sad and crying, comes self-loathing and I can't stop the pain so I get the urge to SH. I'd like to not, but I'm just feeling so much.I don't know what I'm looking for here...but might as well post.
I'm not in a great place I guess. I feel really anxious and frustrated and really want to hurt myself. I guess my question is, if I do self harm and not want to stop will my therapist or family be able to force me into inpatient? I'm still fairly functional, i just don't think I can stop. I'm not suicidal (at the moment) but I think I still function so why cant I just do it and be fine . . .

After hours of contemplating of cancelling meeting the counsellor yesterday I finally manage to drag myself to attend a session. I haven't harm myself for maybe 8 years and a few months back I started harming myself and ever since been having thoughts about it. Talking to the counsellor, he gave me some tips of how to find alternative method to cope with my thoughts/urge instead of self harming. I find it useful and started to make the list as suggested. However one of the alternative suggested by him was to have a friend to hang out and that I could confined to and I could leave the self harm out of the topic but just tell them that my feelings are going south instead, yet I find it so hard to express if the time comes and ever since then I felt as if my chest was being pinned by giant rock and it is constantly aching. Has anyone experience the same road block like I did, and how do you guys talk to your friend about your feelings/emotions going south yet avoid the thoughts of self harm being discuss. 
I have self harmed because I consider the pain cathartic and relaxing. The scars and mess that result are inconveniences.For a while, I was just bruising myself to avoid the scars, but as time went on I went back to cutting, and eventually just had to stop cold turkey. Since then, every time I become distressed, it's a battle with myself not to cut again, until....I discovered hair pullers! I have a Remington, but I know Emjoi is another popular brand. Now, I can run it over my arms and legs as much as I want and feel the wonderful pain I need for release, without harming my skin and at the same time achieving silky smooth legs/arms. It's amazing!!I hope some of you will consider this option instead of turning to a blade again. You can have the temporary relief without the long term effects. Thanks for reading 😊
i really love her
This is more of a short ramble than anything, but the number one reason I self-harm is because I see myself as a broken, flawed, monster of an individual thanks to my mental illnesses that I have. My send of self-worth is so low, that I see harming myself as being the appropriate "punishment" that I deserve, if that makes any sense...I do not cut or burn myself, but I will punch myself, pinch myself, and even hit my head against the wall or door. Just last night before going to bed, I was hitting myself, saying how fed up I am with feeling so broken. I'm sorry.

I can't walk down the street without staring at the ground the moment I make eye contact with anyone, I jump to conclusions.For example, I made eye contact with some guys I was playing sports with the other day, my mind just jumps too wow what are you doing you fucking scrawny piece of shit, everyone hates you, go cut yourself. I have been having problem with my gender identity and I don't really understand what's going on.This is always happening, I can barely bring myself to eat, for the past three days the most I would have eaten is a bread roll and a biscuit and it's not like i'm forcing myself to not eat, i'm just not hungry.I want to have big muscles so I go to the gym everyday, and I see no difference in size, I have been lifting heavy weights for about 6 months now. This makes me want to cut myself more, I think, my arms are so skinny and no one could ever let me pass for being a boy.I really hate my body, and I geuss a coping mechanism i've made up in my head is to cut myself.I feel very alone and thoughts of suicide go through my mind daily.I really don't want to live like this.I really need a friend, someone who understands. 
I haven't cut in a few weeks, and cutting just doesn't feel good anymore. It used to make me feel much better, and I would practically orgasm from it because I'm a masochist, but it doesn't help anymore.Even though it doesn't help I have an overwhelming desire to just cut like crazy. Why is that?
I'm not sure if this is actually any better. It's less physically destructive, that much is true, but idk if it's psychologically an improvement or not given that it is more of a knee-jerk reaction in the moment. Thoughts? Or maybe not. I'm not really sure what I actually want to hear, I may just be posting for attention at this point. 
I haven't harmed in a long time for me. I tell my friend how long its been sense I last did it because I'm proud of myself she says stop talking to me, I'm tired of it. So I have cut two separate times in the last 24 hours. I'm also not talking to that friend ever again she has been nothing but a trigger and enabler to me.I set an appointment with therapist for Tuesday. Just looking for strength and support from anyone. Also advice. I have been to therapy before but it was always mandatory. This is the first time I'm paying for it myself, being an adult and all, so I want to get actual positive results. I'm very scared and embarrassed  to open up and be 100% real. Also I had a lot of trouble following through with any advice past therapist gave me. But this this time I want to make a change, I'm paying to much not too. Well thanks I appreciate you 
On New Year's Eve I got drunk and hurt myself (it was mostly because I was drunk). My best friend got really mad at me and my boyfriend told me that it was the last chance to ever be friends with him. I later found out they were lying to me (on accident), they don't know that I know they're lying to me. In turn I've been lying to them about how I feel. Why should I trust them with me if they're just going to lie to me. I really needed to see my therapist and I was supposed to after I went to the 24 hour unit. Anyways I was supposed to see her tomorrow and the office called and canceled because of an emergency and they don't know when I'll see her next. They made an appointment with another therapist next week on Thursday. I don't know what to do now. I really want to hurt myself and I just want to die. Yet I don't want to be like this. What should I do?
No matter if I'm using healthier coping strategies or not at the end of the day I still am me and I hate me. I suffer in silence like a real man should
Hi all, I cut pretty seriously for 5 or 6 years, but I have stopped and been clean for about 3 years now. There are days when I don't even think about it (which I never thought would happen) but there are times when it seems like it's the only thought in my brain. About a year after I stopped, I got a tattoo. The tattoo felt a lot like cutting to me, but it wasn't triggering. I got a second tattoo about a year ago and didn't even associate it with a cutting sensation. A few days ago I got a third tattoo. The tattoo that I got is right in the location that I used to cut, only slightly above the edge of my scars. Getting the tattoo felt a lot like cutting but was also weirdly unpleasant so I thought I was going to be fine. What has been really difficult is the healing process-- it feels so eerily similar to having fresh cuts in the exact location that I used to cut. I haven't felt it for years, and it's making me miss it more than I ever thought possible. I don't know what I'm looking for but would love to hear any thoughts/experiences/encouragements. Thanks all. 
So I go back to see the Dr on tuesday which is when he’ll tell my my thyroid is now hypo and start me on meds. Since seeing him last month i’ve gained almost 15 pounds despite working out and eating correctly. This has been messing with my mind so much lately. I dont think anyone I talk to about it is really getting it. Every time I look in the mirror I want to carve myself up. I know that im gaining weight because of my thyroid, that im doing everything in my power to be healthy and am doing it correctly. I know that as soon as I see the dr and get back on my meds it will start going down but that doesnt stop the thoughts from coming. I’ve told the few people who know about my problem with harming and how it’s making me want to relapse only to be ignored basically. It’s just very frustrating and overwhelming. I hate the way I look which is not something im used to. Every time I post in r/justloseit their supportive but it’s always advice that im either already doing or know about because I meet with a nutritionist every month. I just want the numbers on the scale to be going back down to where they should be and for this to stop affecting me so much before I make a mistake and relapse UPDATE: Went and saw the doctor. A normal thyroid reading is between .5 and 4 mine was 124. Started me back on my meds and we’re both hopeful things will even out. I also told him about having some depression and the urges getting stronger. I believe their linked to my thyroid and he encouraged me to come back sooner if they dont get any better. I expressed concern about that because I didn’t want an anti depressant or mood stabilizer pushed on me when I didn’t feel that was what I needed. We talked and he told me that he doesn’t like prescribing meds unless he absolutely believes their necessary. It felt freeing to have an open and honest discussion. Last time I brought it up with a different doctor I was told since I didn’t have a problem with alcohol or drugs it wasn’t a big deal. I feel better knowing that im doing everything in my control and power and the problem was something I couldnt control but now am working towards fixing it. 
My friend just posted this on Twitter, how can I go about helping him? Not sure if this is the right sub, if not let me know and I'll delete it. http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1so4qsd

Hey guys, I could use some help. So, I started self-harming again sometime in early December or late November. It's quickly become an issue, and its very addictive. I've recently tried new methods of self-harm, such as bruising and burning myself, aside from cutting. But a couple days ago, I realized that this problem is probably not going to go away on its own. The question comes up here. I know I need to get help somehow. The only outlet of help I could get is through my mom. I kinda want to find out a way to tell her. Most of the time, I just don't want to break her happy mood because it just seems like it would be a burden. Any ideas?
i want to have a reliable venting source but i also don't want to have the police show up to my house.
I wrote a post here a while back about how I relapsed after two years of no self-harm. A few days later, I relapsed again and went wild with cuts. I gave myself cuts until I couldn't find space to fit more of them. I hit myself across the face and choked myself until my brain was numb. I hurt myself in sessions for the whole day. That was in late November.With the help of my friends, I was able to hold off on self-harm for a month now. I'm trying my absolute hardest to resist every urge, and it's not easy. I get urges every day and I fight with myself to not let the urges get the better of me. It's exhausting really, but I made it through a whole month without giving in to my addiction.  I really really really want to hurt myself again, but I don't want to let my friends down. 
I fell for this extremely common (apparently) Moneygram Craigslist scam. I lost a little over $1000, which was my savings (23).Background: NEET out of college, ended a summer job, living with parents, and I was living off of that lump-sum paycheck.I started hitting myself last night, or the night before. I can't remember. I'm baffled by my own stupidity, that I never bothered to check this with anyone external in my life. Didn't once ask my parents, any of my friends, and I'm single. I've had issues like this before, where I enter a sketchy situation, and keep many details private. Doesn't usually end up well, this is very self destructive.I've been known to jokingly slap my forehead yelling 'stupid!'. I reached the point where I meant it. I'm an able bodied male, and I'm putting quite a bit of force behind these slaps. After I get dizzy from about 3-4 of those, I bunch up my thighs and start punching them. They can take more abuse, since they don't contain a brain. I'm hoping to switch over to hitting my legs exclusively.I feel so tunnel-visioned, stupid, and alone. This makes me want something horrible happen to me, that's not my fault. I'm not yearning for death. I don't feel like myself.
My head is getting so flooded with ideas that I need to tell someone else. I want to start cutting tally marks into myself starting new year till end of year. Is it self harm if its "artistic" or pre thought out? I very much want to do this. Over the summer my GF was the only thing in the world that made me happy. Smiling till it hurt happieness but I wasn't ready for it. She tried so hard and all I did was hurt her for her effort. I think the only way I can be happy again is to be with someone. I'm very scared but I'm trying.
everything is awful and i want to hurt myself (already have, but i mean i want to do it more. like needing-stitches level. bleeding out. i dont even know what i want)   nobody knows about this, not irl. apart from my housemates and theyre kicking me out next year because im Too Crazy and they cant cope with me because third year of uni is important an d i dont see the point of trying to stop cuttingwhy is it so bad? why is it worse than smoking or drinking? 
I used to absolutely hate myself after I cut, but my view on it has completely changed. It gives me a rush of euphoria, for lack of better terms. I like the way my skin parts in the area that I sliced open. I like the blood flow that follows. I like the feeling of the scarring that takes place some time after. I don't even feel pain. I feel like I've just become accustomed to it. I do it every night, several times. It's just another part of my day.
I hope you find the strength to make it through another day of recovery
And so this is Christmas and what have I done? I've been so fuckin' depressed that I can barely move. All my Christmases have been bad for the past twenty years. Both my parents have passed away and I'm just a fuckin' footnote to the rest of the family. What do I want to do? I want to smash my head so hard that I'll never have to feel or think anymore. 
*i am in no way attacking cutters, I know fully well the struggle even if it's not on a personal level. These are my experiences, so don't come at me with any bullshitI am fucking tired of the cutters are the only self harmers that count mentality from the people around me. I'm getting fucking sick of it. I'm being erased completely, I'm being glossed over. I need help, too, I want to get better, too. I just had someone that I trust completely cut all ties because they felt I'm an attention whore who's "Problems aren't serious enough for help". I've been crying for hours. My problems aren't real guys, it's all fake, I can suck it up. Why? Because I don't cut, and if you don't cut, it's not that bad. I fucking hate this. I spent 3 hours getting yelled at for trying to do what they told me to do. Being told I don't know real pain, that since I haven't cut it hasn't gotten bad yet. Being told to quit bitching. Counsellors don't listen because I'm not hurting myself apparently, friends don't bother because I obviously don't have a problem. I wouldn't be so mad if it wasn't for the argument that led to the loss of my only "friends". This girl we all know, shes older than us. It's been 3 years since she's last cut. 3. Fucking. Years. And I shit you not, my "friends" hosted a mini intervention basically telling me to fuck off because I'm being a leech. Because I asked for help. And their reasoning is that she needs the emotional support. I'm fucking laughing. I haven't laughed like this in ages. These people are all cutters, mind you. I don't need help I guess. Not eating?Not sleeping?Bruising?Hitting?Slapping?Choking?Biting?These things don't hurt. Only cutting hurts.
This is the second time in two months normally there is about 6 months in between. i cant seem to like myself i dont know why but i fucking hate myself im not good at anything im just here present in this POS world. I tried to kill myself before but chose to stop after someone else in my community commitwd suicide. I didnt want to put people through that but i have to suffer on. 
Well, it had been around 5 months since I'd cut. It was pretty bad from around April to June of this year, but the compulsion to do it finally faded. It's been back for awhile, and I've talked a lot about it in therapy, but haven't acted on it. It kinda felt like the bottom fell out of life (again) about a week and a half ago, and I've really struggled with wanting to act on various self-destructive behaviors. This time of year is always really hard for me. I'd been really close to cutting several times over the last few days, but managed not to by telling myself I could always do it in an hour if I still wanted to, then trying to keep myself distracted. Finally, early this morning, I just had to. Very superficial for me... just enough to satisfy the urges for awhile. Anyway... just wanted to tell someone since my therapist is out of town until after New Years. 
Hello,A friend of mine has been self harming for a few months (probably longer but I am unsure).I've tried looking up a lot of information so I can respond in a decent way when she contacts me, I've asked about the experiences of other friends whom self harmed.Currently I feel like the urge to self harm is a feeling that you can't do anything about. I know I can't stop her from doing that or expect her to stop.A different friend said he liked distraction when he had that feeling, like someone calling him. Would it be wise to call her when I feel that she will self harm?The thing I worry about the most is that she has accepted it. She accepts that she self harms once each week. She thinks no one can help her and that she can't even help herself. Is there a way to let her now that she should try to work on it, alone or together with someone?I know I can't stop her but there must be a way to offer help, even if it is ever so slight.I really hope some people can open up about their past experiences and what they think that would've helped so I can try to offer her more support.
Hi! I've been clean for a couple of months but my main trigger is my family and during holidays I spend too much time arround them. Friends are away or with family so hanging out with them isn't really an option. Sometimes I get really embarrassed about cutting, my bf doesn't know about it and I'm afraid of what he'll think of me if he ever discovers it: either that I'm victimising my self or that I'm sick and crazy.Also when I crave cutting I spend too much on food clothes and other treats and I feel it will become a problem if I don't find any other way to cope.Thanks so much :)
My worse cut a year ago is my norm now. I keep wanting to put giant holes in my leg. Please someone who's been where I am tell me whats next. I want to cut deeper and deeper and when I do I take pictures so I can look at it. I can never get high or drunk enough. I really like being drunk, high and cutting. Im pretty drunk right now. I wonder when I see cut tomorrow what will I think
There are two people in this story. He1 and He2. Gender of one has been changed.I don't feel worthy, I'm so tired, so alone, so done. I know it wasn't my fault he1 killed himself, and we weren't even together anymore, but I still feel guilty for it. I was the last one he1 talked to.It's been ten years, and I still can't cope with the emotions. Anniversary of the first time we met. If we didn't meet, would that have changed anything? I introduced he1 and he2 to each other. I've come to terms with he2 killing himself, he2 never told me anything, and the police report put time of death the night before the call. But he1 called me hours before he1 went missing. I was the last call on his1 phone. If I listened through the emotions, actually paid attention to it instead of just wanting to get off the phonecall, would he1 be alive?It's been all these goddamned years, and I still feel guilty.I was at 367 days without self harming. Now I'm at 0. But I'll get it back up there, slowly but surely, until my next mis-step. Then I'll get back up on that horse, and try again. And again. It's all I can do.
I can't stop it. I can't get rid of this blade. I can't distract myself to stop. I just want to do it. I'm giving in again.

Im feeling good about life and Im happy. But outta nowhere something will happen and bring me way down and I'll either cut myself up or do a lot of drugs depending on the day of week. And this all just creates a downward spiral that can last a day a week a month or even more. Is there an effective mental technique that will prevent you from reacting till your mind goes back to a more logical state. It is summer now and I hate having to wear a jumper to hide all the cuts. 
Did it help? My therapist wants me to try it but it seems silly to me. I'm afraid it will just cause more guilt.
I don't want to do it anymore. I mean the urge is still there, it's even kinda bad right now, but I just don't want to do it anymore, I just want to get better. I don't really know how to stop myself from doing it, it's just become my automatic response to anything going wrong as I've done it for just too long now. Does the urge ever go away? It's such a struggle to avoid doing it even when I know how much of a failure it makes me. 
I don't meant quit forever, not saying you shouldn't and I wish I wanted too but how do you stop when you start. I keep feeling the need to do more and when I look at it I say its not enough or I need to harm somewhere else.Whats helps you stop?
I want to cut. The urge comes and goes, but the desire is nearly always there..I want to relieve myself. I want to feel better, but I also want to get better. It's inexplicably difficult holding back--I can't suppress this urge any longer and it hurts me so much to even think about the possibility that this is just a part of who I am. Cutting for 9 years, even when I stop, I come back to it...what is there to do? There is no pill to make you not want it...I not only feel ugly on the outside, but on the inside too..broken....hopeless..too old for this shit.
Because I drink every day to try to cope with how I feel and I know it's bad for me. I need it though
Is that why some people get grossed out by piercings? What are your thoughts?
Been having a rough week. Not really sure why, just been sad for the past few days and tonight’s kind of bad. Had some intense dreams last night and the night before. Told my friend that knows that I was having a rough night, I guess so is he because he ignored me. Other friend is spending time with his family whom he rarely gets to see so I dont feel comfortable bugging him right now. I’m going to bed before I do something i’ll regret in the morning. Just feel lonely I guess. 
I've been hurting myself. I look awful. I know it. There's no getting around it, no sugar-coating it.I was looking forward to this. I had a couple of weeks where I didn't hurt myself for a few days and it looked like I'd never hurt myself at all. I went to some (minor) special measures to kickstart the healing, to improve my general appearance.And the event is mere hours away and I've been hurting myself. Again. I've completely undone any good I may have enacted. I feel horribly, horribly embarrassed and ashamed of myself.And I cannot get a docs appointment, still, after days and days of hoping for a shot at diagnosis + the help I need. I'm not suicidal. I just can't bear to be like this any longer.I spend every waking moment hating myself.

I'm in therapy right now and going through a rough patch. I've started self-harming again and last time I saw my therapist I said I had relapsed.  Her response was sadness.  She said that she didn't want me to hurt myself. Frankly I've decided to self-harm for now, but try out different coping techniques and hopefully find the right one.I know my therapist's doesn't like me cutting, and it makes her sad and afraid, so I'm not sure how to advance in therapy in light of this.
I cut again, and I just feel like a worthless pile of shit. I can't stop cutting so why should I even try? I'm always gonna be a worthless dumbass anyway.

I'm crashing right now, and I think that it's gonna get worse and I'm gonna relapse. At this point, I don't even care if I relapse. I know it'll fuck me up more in the long run, but I just don't care right now, I want a release.
Went with my friend and filed a police report, she was assaulted at our local store by a group of teenagers. Turns out multiple people had the same encounter. I felt my blood boil when she told me what had happened and was certain that if I had been there it would of been a different story. I felt good taking action like that. The assault had escalated by the time they did it to her and I told her that if they had done this in a parking lot or elsewhere it could of ended differently or if they continued to get away with it they could continue to escalate. Then I took a step back and thought back to when I was a victim. I was raped almost seven years ago but never came forward. I finally told a few people a year later. I never felt comfortable talking about it and knew a report wouldn’t do any good, it would be his word against mine. I was upset with myself because I had always thought I would defend myself and make anyone sorry for messing with me. But when it happened it caught me off guard and I just couldn’t. I believe the circumstances and details are partially why I wasn’t able to at the time. Now that im older I feel that if a stranger was to try anything they would regret it, but the attacker was someone I knew. A part of me was angry with myself for not going all Jackie Chan on him. Of course this incident made my self harming worse. I feel like the way I felt and handled what happened to my friend is a testament to how far i’ve come from that angry scared girl to the person I am now. It’s been over a year I think since my last relapse. I have bad days sure but I feel better equipped to handle them. A small part of me is wondering why I couldn’t of been like this a few years ago but I can’t dwell on those thoughts for too long. I’ve got a life to live. 
For the first time in years I finally wore shorts in front of my kids. The scars are still visible but not as dark. It may only be a minor thing but for me it was monumental.
I think the only reason I stopped cutting is because I know my friend would see them, and he would be so hurt if he knew I was cutting again. I want to cut. I want to cut so bad, but I can't bring myself to hurt him.But it's hard.


The one friend that I regularly talk to has been busy lately. I can't fault her for that, life happens, but if anyone would be up to chat that would be great. 
So I only ever mentioned my cutting one time to a friend, and that was years ago, and I passed it off as a phase thing that I did once. But I've been going through a rough patch recently, and started again, and I think I should tell at least one. Is this a good idea?  I'm a 20-something guy, so advice from anyone with similar experience would be appreciated. PM me if you don't want to post public.
They just never stop do they? I like to tell myself that they stop but I know in the back of my mind they are always fucking there. 
I haven't cut in a week. long ass time for me. I've been hearing voices a lot. I think they are helping me. I told my friend she wanted me to kill myself. I don't know whats wrong with me. I think im bipolar. I feel like if I cut my problems will fade away
When I cut I don't get the same satisfaction that I used to, and it just leaves me feeling empty. Why?
As the title says, I'm really feeling the struggle. I moved away to college this Autumn and while it's been stressful, I didn't take my tools with me and so despite having depressive days, I haven't harmed since August. While at college no-one has even mentioned my arms (although it took some getting used to for them -- I noticed a couple of stares at the beginning) except for the nurse who just asked if I'd harmed recently (which I honestly said no to).However at this youth group I go to, I recently took off my hoodie (rather than just rolling up the sleeves) and while my forearms have a moderate amount of scars on them, they're mostly fully faded and the rest are pretty muted pink. My upper forearms and my upper arms are much paler because I didn't tan there this summer and so the pink scars there stand out a lot more, so several people made comments in group. I quickly shut it down and my friends and the leaders were already aware of it so they weren't bothered, but it's got me reaaally uncomfortable because I self harmed a lot for the attention that it got me online (and I hoped I could get from any strong adult figure in real life).While I was angry/snapped at those who made sympathetic comments in group the other night I am still craving their concern a lot. I thought I was doing so good, I was planning the coverup tats I would get after all my arms had faded and I'd turned 18, now I'm itching to harm again to get more sympathy and attention even though I hate getting it in real life from real people. God I don't know what to do, I don';t have any tools that I would want to use so I can't/won't relapse but I really need some support/attention/people saying they understand how I feel and that it's not bad of me to think it. idk. :(
So some history for context. Been depressed for two years, off and on, mostly functional, family doesn't know, roommates don't know, but I have a couple close friends that do. Anyways, way before I ever got depressed, back when I was about 16, one night I had a random urge to cut on my arm. It was so strong, but I didn't do it and was super confused. A few weeks later, same thing happened, and I pulled out a swiss army knife and just had a feel, but I didn't do it. Eventually, one night I caved, and cut myself super shallow, more like just a few scratches. Anyways, I was super embarrassed about this and didn't tell anyone for a long time, and the urge was gone. A year later, I did it again a few times in a short period. Then went a period of about two years where I forgot all about the urge. When my depression finally hit, it began to cross my mind a lot more. Cuts weren't deeper, but more of them. Now it's like a cycle. Long periods of nothing, then out of no where, I pull a knife out and have to struggle not to cut.Does anyone know what possible reason I keep getting the super strong urges to cut out of the blue? It doesn't seem directly linked to my depression (as in it seems independent of my good/bad days).Secondly, how do I stop (the urges, more than the actions)?Any theories or suggestions would be appreciated.
Just what the title says. I have been doing well for a while than last night picked up the blade and again this morning. I don't need to talk I don't need to go through why. I just have to say that I did
So at this point I only really have one friend that I regularly talk to about this kind of stuff and I'm of course grateful that she's there to listen. I burnt myself today for the first time in a while and felt bad for telling her. Of course, her concern and obvious emotional distress at hearing this is comforting in some way but I feel like I'm being manipulative by telling her knowing that it will elicit an emotional reaction. 
I've been self harming since I was 13 and I'm 24 now. I initially used self harm as a distraction and found safety pins were my favorite tool. The repetition of digging into my arm (or where ever) was soothing. Since I was 13 I've had countless trips to the ER for stitches. When asked what I used, nurses and doctors were always shocked. One doctor even told me he didn't believe I used a safety pin and he thought I used a blade and was lying to him. My injuries tend to be severe. I just wanted to know if anyone has the same experience as me. I feel like such a freak for causing such damage with a fucking safety pin. Who needs stitches from that! I just feel sick I guess. It's easy to need stitches from blades but I astonish (and scare) myself with what I do. Am I the only one that does this?
 The urges to cut are getting too strong so I give in...I promised I'd stop but it's not a promise that I could keep and if they find out they will go crazy and blame themselves. What do I do because I can't fight it anymore.....
It doesn't sound like much but i used to self harm almost everyday. I finish my CBT this week, and I'm so proud of myself for not self harming for 2 weeks!Still trying to ignore the strong urges though, any advice?
I apologize if this breaks any rules. I describe hitting myself below, so don't read on if that might trigger you. Mods can remove this as necessary.I've been doing this for some time now, whenever I get overwhelmed. I'm not sure why I do it. I guess the same reason anyone self harms. I like punishing myself. I like feeling something. I like taking myself out of the moment and distracting myself from  what is overwhelming me. It started off with just hitting the top of my head when I got really angry. Then it was slapping myself in the face. Then hitting myself with a closed fist until I left bone bruises that would make my temple and my cheekbones hurt for days. Now it seems I've started aiming for the softer target that is my nose, maybe hoping to break it and do some real damage. I type this with a handful of tissues up to my nose to stop the bleeding. I don't know, I've wondered for awhile if maybe I'm on the autism spectrum. I've heard of people with autism hitting themselves as they get overwhelmed. And I hate change, I have a hard time with eye contact, I'm socially terrible. Not that some self-diagnosed label matters anyway. Regardless, I need to control this, I'm afraid that I'll really hurt myself if I keep this up.
I keep having urges to cut even though I haven't cut in the past 3 years. I started cutting when I was 12 or 13 and did my best to hide it. I wasn't looking for attention, I just need some way to vent or "feel" something if you will. And it worked great for the first couple of months. But once friends started noticing I would stop or do a better job at hiding it. I was always worried that they would tell my parents.When I got to highschool I limited how much I cut, but I would still do it when I was feeling down, depression or anxiety sank in, or I had an unreasonable fear that I couldn't overcome such as worrying about failing a class or doing bad on a project. I know it seems small, but at the moment that those things take place, it seems like the most important thing in the world. I met my now fiancée in high school and I eventually told her that I had self-harmed before, but not that I was still actively doing it. We had a rough patch and it became more noticeable so I had to come clean with her, and a few other friends, that I had been cutting and that I never really quit, just took breaks at times.When I graduated in 2010, I felt that all was going to be fine as I had not self-harmed in a few months prior to graduation. However, college came with more stress than high school and I took up cutting again. After the first year I more or less failed out of Penn State and returned home, on my own free will, but started at a community college and got a part time job where I worked full time hours. But this situation only made me feel more defeated and I started cutting more. These times in college though I was able to hide it from my girlfriend, even though we are intimate. It just go to the point where I couldn't handle myself doing it for a couple months and quitting for a couple months on and off. So when I felt myself stopping the cycle I tossed out the small knife that I had hid over the years and used to cut myself. (At least I think I tossed it out, it could be hidden and I just forgot where it is). I graduated from the community college in 2012 and did an internship at Disney. Since then I have been clean, which is about 3 years, and that's great. However, I started at a normal university last fall where I am working on a Journalism/PR Degree. And that should be great, and my grades are good. But during my first two semester I saw a girl who was cutting, and I felt bad for her and didn't know what to say. I never really talked to anyone about my issues and most people only told me to stop, and I knew that never worked. As time went on though, I stopped thinking about talking to her about it and felt more like doing it myself. Now, as this semester comes to an end and I prepare for my last semester at college I am filled with stress. I have projects due now, an internship in the spring, and more worries about life after college. Even though I am 24, I struggle with wondering how I am going to make it through this.I know that I quit cold turkey and that could be part of the reason that the girl triggered it in me. I shake at times thinking about it. And I don't want to pick it up because I don't know how I would explain it to my fiancée. As far as she knows I have been clean since high school.I don't know what I am looking for. And I don't know how much of the above makes sense. I just needed to get this out and tell people. 

... by cutting. Lame, I know. Last night I had a bad night. I kept thinking it wasn't deep enough, I need to go deeper. I cut for I don't know how long. Before I know it I'm scrambling to find bandages. I have to go to store to get them.I wrapped a bandage around my whole bicep to cover them. I worked, didn't look at them for a the whole day. I take off bandage and start crying. They are still bleeding. I see them now and they are fucking scary. It made me freak out for a little bit. I panicked. I thought about my experience in crisis center. Which made me freak out more. I know now that I did belong there. I feel like I'm snapped back into my real mind right now and it feels good. I don't know how long I'm going to have it but I need to make changes in my life.I don't want to do that to myself anymore. 
I'm a very emotional person. My emotions are irrational. I talk a lot about my irrational emotions and complain about everything. He and my friend both say I have to be stronger and just suffer in silence because I'm ruining their lives. I wrap everyone up in my shit, making whatever is going on in my life 10 times worse. So this is my last post here. He checks this subreddit anyway (not for me, he feels good helping others). Off to suffer alone. Will I live? Die? No one knows. It's an adventure. 
Throwaway account.A long time ago, I was talking to my brother about how I was scared of being in a swimsuit because of the scars on my thighs from self injury. I told him I carved the word 'Dyke' into my left thigh. He told me, to reassure me of course, that it wasn't that bad, that it would fade away and that I made it sound worse than it was, and how I shouldn't be worried.I don't know why, but god, that memory has been haunting me since. It got me to relapse, bad. My thighs were covered. The recovery from it was slow and shit but I learned to manage and get to a point where I was self harm free. Now I've been free for nearly an entire year, but lately something's happened again that I keep going back to and thinking about.My sister was self harming for a little while (her ex-boyfriend was a stressor in her life) which ended up with her scratching at her arm for a couple weeks. She told me, my brother and her friends. She sent pictures to them talking about it. And god, I can't... even begin to describe how shitty I feel saying this, but I'm so fucking... I went through it on my own. I didn't tell anyone. I cut myself for months and months and months and I ran out of room on my wrists up to my elbow. I ran out of room on my thighs entirely. I started cutting at my stomach and ankles by the time I started to realize how much of a problem I had and managed to get off of it then. And she scratches at her arm for two weeks and gets all the attention and love and support she can possibly get and I just. I was so jealous. I'm still fucking jealous. I am so fucking insanely jealous over something so fucking serious because she was still absolutely self harming. And even though I helped her through it, there's still this awful nagging feeling about it.That's not really the end of that. My brother and I were talking about my sister like a couple weeks or so ago, about how she used to scratch at her arm. My brother told me that scratching was a lot worse than my cutting, because it had to have higher pain tolerance involved.I don't even know why I'm typing this. I just. I feel like a failure in the one thing that I've used to punish myself for *being* a failure. I need to let this out somewhere. I feel so goddamn sick and disgusted with myself, but having those talks, it just makes... I just want to end up cutting more. I just want to end up cutting so fucking deep the blood pools out and never stops and fills the fucking world with it. I got so close today to throwing away that almost year. I just don't know what to do.How do I stop comparing myself to others? My injuries to theirs? My pain tolerance to theirs? How do I stop never feeling good enough in any category? How?
How do I stop, what do I do instead? I'm scared and have no clue what to do, I have no one to talk to about it.
I relapsed into self-harm. I'm not sure if I'm ready to quit for right now. So much as been going on in my life and it keeps me sane. I know there are other things I can do, but the SI at least quells the urges. 
1: Are there any guys in here who self harm?2: If so, what is yor method of choice( cutting, hitting etc)? (No details).3: Are you open about it? If so how was it like for you revealing it to your peers.4: do you feel there is more shame for a man who self harms than a woman? If so why? 5: what do you find helpful pertaining to self harm either from your self or medical personell, by this i mean what do you mean helps you not self harm?I have been asked to speak about my own experience as a self harmer at a national conference on selfharm held by the national association for selfharm and suicide in norway. I am just a regular joe, so i need some input. Thank you in advance for sharing
I cut myself again. I know it's going to become a habit again and I don't want it to and I feel guilty every time but it's the only thing that can calm me down. My boyfriend of a year broke up with me so I'd feel awkward going to him for help. I can't put that pressure on him again. He helped me make it 8 months last year. My friend, J, isn't too close to me anymore and I feel like I'm already going weirding him out. My friend, S, is going through their own shit rn and To make it more complex, we've been fucking so I don't want to make things weird between us. Maybe I should just stop trying to get help. Maybe I should just give up. 
Idk what came over me. I was depressed before, obviously still am, have been suicidal, and had a massive urge to hurt myself, so I did. I don't know why I did it or what it do about it but I'm scared. Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this because it's for stopping self harm, when I literally just started it, if it is wrong can someone tell me/mods delete the post.
If this is anything more than a benign tumor, I will not be able to deal. I can't deal with surgery and shit. I like my breasts and I don't want them to be scarred. It takes every fiber of my being to not break something and slice my wrist right now. 
For some reason when I SH there are no marks left behind. I will feel like an idiot if I tell my therapist I've been hurting myself and I have no marks. I'll feel like I'm lying.
I'm 22. Started self harming around 15. Went through a dark patch and moved from a serious cutting problem to trying to reach out for help to trying several antidepressants and mood-stabilizers.  Fell into a negative relationship with somebody who encouraged me to cut myself with him as a romantic activity. Went full on hack and slash on my thighs to show him that there was nothing romantic about my harming myself. He shut down after that, he continued to self medicate himself and I broke it off because I knew I didn't love him and he didn't love me, he loved the mess that was me.I went from depressed to numb to full of energy to rock bottom to empty to impatient with the drugs. 'Why am I not better yet?' I'd ask. Finally, I stopped the pills at 17. They made me feel like a stranger in my own body. Had a few other relationships in high school, but I felt distanced from others, which really betrayed my outgoing nature. Decided around then that I would just stick to FWB because I felt like I could never fully commit to anybody, that I wasn't worth anybody's love and affection.Turned 18, graduated high school, moved out of a less than desirable situation at home to a new town 50 miles away, started working retail. Lived with older siblings and room mates. Alcohol, sexual promiscuity, and denial became routine. Another FWB came from a drunken party hook up (who would later become my current relationship of 2 years). I had no self-confidence. By now, my cutting had completely stopped, but other behaviors replaced it.Since I stopped cutting, very hot water became my go-to method of self harm. I would run the taps to boiling at home, at work, and wherever else the water would get hot enough to scald and sting. At the time, I thought the feeling had been clarity. I would breathe deeply, pushing down the urge to cry, and move on with my day with puffy red skin, no scars to hide.This self harm needed to be put to an end when I started massage school. My arms became my most focused on body part. This was when I really started withdrawing from concerned friends. It had become so easy to lie to them. "I'm fine, but thanks for asking." Was played on repeat.I have been a massage therapist for 2 years now. Occasionally, I run my taps too hot, but never for more than a few seconds. It's something that reminds me that I still have much to work on in myself. I think about how cutting used to make me feel every day, but haven't for almost 6 years now.The urge to hurt myself or even the feelings of wanting to just fade away... It's always going to be there, isn't it?I can pat myself on the back, tell myself I'm doing better, but at the end of the day, I know the truth.I feel like this is just something I can't change and that scares me.I could ramble on and on. I could answer questions for hours. I do feel like chatting helps...
I've been dealing with depression for many years...ever since I can remember and I think it's been intensified by the traumas I've experienced. When I'm feeling super sad or upset at someone else/myself, the palms of my hands tingle with what feels like electricity. I don't know where to direct the energy in my hands aside from making them into fists and punching my surroundings or myself. I am a 22 year old female and have been doing this since 14. A few weeks ago it got so bad that I must have punched myself in the face at least 50 times, punched my windshield which cracked it, and smashed my head against my windshield cracking it AGAIN. I've given myself two black eyes among other bruises and bumps all over the top of my head. I sometimes scratch down my cheeks, too. It is temporary relief and I usually feel ok afterwards but am left with a ton of frustration as to why I hurt myself. After the last bad breakdown, my parents brought me to a psych hospital where I spent a week, and I'm now in therapy often.Why the hell do I do this? Does anyone else go through this specific kind of self harm against your face? I recently started Effexor, a SNRI to combat my depression but I still do it... 
Hello all, this past week I found out that my girlfriend self harms when she is feeling anxiety. I've never seen this side of her before and we have been together for awhile now. She tells me it's been an ongoing habit since high school and I'm sort of lost on how I can help her. She had a panic attack in front of me last Thursday and since then, she has been having them on and off when we are hanging out. She tells me that a lot of it is due to stress and drama that's happening at her college, things with juggling multiple jobs, clubs and sorority activities. Last night when she was over and I left the room, I came back to find her hitting herself in the thigh with my rubber mallet. She came clean and told me everything as far as how she feels the urge to hurt herself when she is feeling down. She says she has been seeing a counselor once a week for a couple of months now but she says she can't tell her counselor about her self harming issues due to the nature of her work (teaching profession) and I don't know what to do to help. I want to support her and every time she has had a panic attack I just sit with her and try to help her through it. If anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated, I just want to help her get better and maybe find another outlet for her negative feelings. Thanks. 
When I try it returns an unknown error.It requested Dropbox have permissions and I had declined them because I didn't see the reasoning behind it but there is no way to re-enable them.I have literally no friends, my family is "sick of your shit", and will no longer talk to me. I live 6 hours away from my nearest family member so even forcing myself on them and demanding help is not an option.Last time I called the NSPH I was immasculated by the operator and it encouraged me to attempt, and I nearly died that time.I want help desperately, and this service seems like my only option. Can someone please help me fix this.I'm scared, and I know that if I can't do anything, or even just speak with someone, especially through my comfort zone of texting, I will not be able to stop myself tonight.I want help. I do, and that is why I am asking for someone to help me fix this. I am alone, I am isolated, and I am scared of myself.Please help. Please.

I'm alone in an unfamiliar city while studying abroad. And I love it, but there's no close friend to confide in, my long distance relationship is having its ups and downs, and I've never been able to talk to my family. Hell they don't even know I self harm. But I need someone to know that it's been 31 days and today is fucking hard. Guilt keeps washing over me in waves while I try to remember the progress I've made, why I deserve to have the feeling of progress. I know I'm supposed to be able to provide myself with all the support I need, but a lifetime of only providing myself with criticism is a hard habit to change. Cheers to anyone else in a similar struggle, you're not alone. We will go to bed tonight with no new scars and even if no one else knows, we get to be proud.
I think it's trichotillomania. I can't stop and I'm trying to. I even took a photo of myself earlier and decided I would do so every day while not harming myself. Well guess what I've been doing all fucking evening.I can't see a doctor because there are no appointments available for me to take. Everything seems to be going wrong in my life - my depression is getting worse but I need to come off the medication because it's messing with my appetite, and I can't get a job. My partner seems to not even like me anymore let alone love me (I can't diagnose [not a doctor] them but as a depressive myself I can definitely see signs of depressive behavior in them). And this means that I no longer feel like I have a home; it's just a place I live in. And because *we* seem to be suffering some bizarrely slow implosion, I'm starting to panic that I'll have to find my own place and work out how to do all that associated stuff like rent and tax by myself but of course I don't have a job, so how long would that last? If landlords even took me without having a job? I have savings so I could do it but not for very long.And a couple of weeks ago I had the first panic attack I've had in years. Luckily it wasn't a full-blown screaming fit (bit of a problem living in an apartment) but I had the first few moments before hyperventillation - luckily using my inner voice to shout at myself to stop otherwise I'd cause a massive shitstorm (apartments around us thinking I was being murdered or something?) did the trick.I don't know what to do and I'm meant to be an adult but I have no idea how to fix any of this and I keep trying to reach out to people I know for help but I'm being ignored over and over again. I try and address certain issues with my partner but they just shut me down or deflect over and over. I don't enjoy anything anymore and I don't know what to do.I feel fat, ugly, stupid, and worthless. How am I meant to get out of all this?
Several years ago I was in a car crash. I had burns and bruises on my arms, and the paramedics recommended that I take an ambulance ride on the grounds that they could get infected.The treatment would be burn cream and a tetanus shot, and I'm in the room with one of the ambulance drivers and a nurse. My scars are really bad on my upper-arms, where my short sleeves cover, and predominantly on my left arm. Whenever getting shots, I'm terrified that they'll choose that arm. Unfortunately this go around, they chose that arm.As she lifts up my sleeve, she's instantly concerned. "Where did this come from?! Is this from the accident?" (This makes absolutely no sense, considering the fact that they were healed scars.) I look away and respond, "it's self-inflicted..." "What?", she didn't hear me. So I respond louder, "it's self-inflicted". At that point, the ambulance driver realizes what I said and looks up with a kind of shocked/concerned expression, though the nurse looked at me with a look of disgust.She didn't say anything, but her expression said enough. This is probably the worst reception I've ever received from another person who found out about my scars.If you find out someone self-harms, you should meet them with compassion. Shaming them will only reinforce their silence. They will be less likely to share their struggles with you again. I know my experiences have made it really hard for me to share, and I hate it.
One thing that I've struggled with the most about my experiences with self-harm is the silence. You work up the courage to be vulnerable with someone you trust and tell them your struggle, and they never say anything. Now I understand that it's a difficult topic and sometimes we find ourselves at a loss for words, but how hard is it to just ask questions? Not to mention, that after I reveal my struggle it's never addressed again. If I knew that a person that I cared about was harming themselves, I would hold them accountable. Has anyone else experienced this horrible silence? 
today my therapist called me; actually while I was selfharming. I went in and left like I had learned something. I'm very happy that I seeked help. I can't speak for anyone else but I never thought therapy would help me not even a little bit and its only my first session in a long time but it at least today helped a little bit.Real reason I wrote this right here... In my session today I gave my blades that I had to therapist (not that it really matters I don't think) and I told her that I steal the blades that I use. I made a joke and said "I'm not that crazy that I would pay to hurt myself" she  laughed. 
My daughter is 13.  We have had a tough go of things the last five years.  From the divorce and custody battle to my own struggles with depression and self harm (She doesn't know).  I haven't cut myself in 3+ years.  I try to keep looking forward instead of back. I've worked so hard to bridge the gap between us.  To love her to help her discover and love life.  Monday I took her to see Sleeping with Sirens and All Time Low.  It was an amazing concert.  She was mingling with the crowd and dancing and just having fun.  She seemed so relaxed.  I thought to myself this this is the life, this is how we mend the feels between us.  We can't talk to each other about those things that matter with out crying but maybe we can connect through our mutual love of music.  My daughter got in some serious trouble at school yesterday.  It was fairly serious.  Her mother and I were talking to her about it.  She hates me, hates herself, hate's life.  My ex-wife asked her if she was hurting herself (My ex knows I have done this) and made her take off her sweater.  I was horrified. She was cutting herself.  I'm totally distraught over it.  My baby is in so much anguish.  I can't fix it nor offer comfort.  I wish I could take back every rotten thing I've done. I'd give anything to fix it.  This is the first time in some many years that I just want....well I want to be in control of my self.  This is a message to the universe and no response is necessary.  If you relate or find comfort in my words...well that is some small measure. 
I'm really getting sick of cutting. I do it so unemotionally I'm not even trying to cope most times. I do it and I'm so upset with myself. For the first time I'm getting upset at myself for doing this. I'm better then this. Yet I'm cutting deeper.I threw out my blades. Please send me your strength. I think I'm ready to be done with this. I just called my old therapist who I walked out on one day.Should I hook up with a girl with a boyfriend. I think I'm better then this. I don't want to get hurt. How should I end this.Its a coworker. took me a couple hours to write this 
For the past few days, due to a mix of weaning off Zoloft, lack of sleep, and school troubles, I've been extremely suicidal. Yesterday, I cried in and out all day. Today, the final bomb dropped; the final grades were entered and the class I was proud to have a 85% in dropped to a 77%. That was it. I promised myself I would apologize to my robotics team and a romantic partner of mine and just relapse and hopefully die. I managed to completed fix half of my school stuff and halfway through the day my mood drastically improved. I made it two full days as a suicidal mess and I didn't even relapse a little. I'm so fucking proud. 
I'm a month and two weeks safe! I hope to FSM that I'll never feel a blade again.
I don't want to do this anymore... I can't be an adult. I have no passion and high anxiety. Also a bf that broke off engagement (though we're together now)... He wants to make films and I'm always involved...  Except he kept an entire short film from me because I get jealous and I'm really useless and unwanted and I want to just disappear.
I gave in and did it against last night. I don't know why but here recently I've been feeling a surge again of negative emotions (anger/frustration and depression mostly) again out of the blue. Last night I just couldn't fight it. I hate how I've been feeling lately. More so because, while obviously depression has a way of popping up and such, I've been liking to think baseline I've been doing better and better lately :(Well, I'm sure I can get through this period again. I just hate it.
Was on a road trip with some friends. Without giving too much away we kind of all work together at the same sort of hobby, we were at a festival for it. Got really drunk last night, was flirting with one of my friends who I've never had any sort of romantic connection, misread some signals, hopped into bed with her, and put my arm around her. Stayed the night. It seemed like what she wanted at the time, but once the haze lifted of the drunkeness, and the subsequent hangover today I realized how dumb that was.She was cool with it. She didn't say no. We flirted a bit in bed, but she didn't reciprocate physically in any way which should have been a sign. We didn't really even talk about it later, but she wasn't even really that weird about it. So it didn't really bother me until I realized how lopsided the decision was, and it was totally on my impulse, and not hers. When I realized all this, this horrible horrible feeling consumed me. You know that embarrassing thing you did in 6th grade that still keeps you up at night occasionally? I knew I had added another shitty memory to haunt me to the grave.Over the last year I've been coping well with my feelings, only one minor incident of self-harm, but tonight I couldn't take it.The idea of being affectionate to someone who isn't into it, but is going along because they can tolerate it is nails on the chalkboard of my soul, and something I've been afraid of happening. There's that, plus the travelling blues of coming home after a trip, plus the hangover (which always gives me weird mood swings), plus me taking my meds way later than I should have, and in a smaller dose that all lead to the perfect storm of self-loathing. The kind of loathing that makes me want resort to the pain-transferring qualities of self-harm.So I cut myself a bit. Might do it again.God it's like being the subject of an /r/cringe post.For the record, I feel like if a drunk dude is going to hop into your bed, I'm not the worse case scenario. I may occasionally be oblivious, but I'm not so oblivious that I would do something really wrong.Writing this out has helped me see how ridiculous this all is. Like a Seinfeld episode, I could see myself having an animated argument over what constitutes a "sign." Because it's not like there wasn't flirting at all. Oh well I'm rambling at this point. I still feel like shit. Probably will for a while. Maybe I hurt myself because I don't believe that karma exists, but that it should. 
I have been self harming for a while now. After almost two years, I began again. It is much worse now. However, I'm trying to stop harming myself. Does anyone know of any helpful ways to stop?
just a friendly reminder from your boy up front
This has been the longest three days of my life. A close family member is in critical care and not going to make it. I was able to visit a day or so ago, seeing him looking so... fragile... it broke me. After I left the guilt hit. Here is another person I didn't get to tell how much I love them until it's too late. Three suicides, two more sudden deaths, one me, a prisoner in my body, beholden to my health conditions. It numbs me, and a huge hole opens in my chest. I feel the ache again, but I desperately don't want to. Please someone, anyone, offer some words of encouragement or advice.  


Last night I had a bad night. I'm thinking sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. I honestly feel like I don't know where I'd be today if I didn't SH yesterday. 
Last night was just too much for me. I took a needle and tore up my skin until I felt better.  It was a small area and I only bleed a little so I told myself I didn't really hurt myself. I just don't knwo right now...

I don't know if this is the right place to post this. I don't actually want to self-harm at all (I guess there might be others here who feel similarly). I feel so tired and trapped. I feel like feeling so tired is some kind of lie and petulance on my part, but I swear I just feel so exhausted all the time. I'm not cutting myself, but I've started binge drinking. I wish I could help someone else instead. I don't have the energy to do anything with myself. I don't even want to die, but I feel like I have no other choice if I'm too tired to do anything else. Drinking is abhorrent in a way that cutting isn't, so maybe I'll start cutting soon and be a step closer to actually killing myself one day. I hate not knowing though.
I'm so disappointed in myself for doing this. I had a fantastic day yesterday and a really good night's sleep (something I rarely get nowadays). I woke up feeling optimistic, but it only took a few minutes for all of that to go away. I was proud that I held out for so long, but today I just couldn't stop myself. I don't know what came over me.I feel defeated.
I stumbled upon this place and was saddened but slightly comforted by the fact that I am not alone in this. I've been struggling with this "problem" for over a decade and it sucks because in times where I refrain I realize cutting isn't the problem but a symptom of the problem. I find myself desperately searching for what causes such intense desire to punish myself that it seems like my mind CANNOT move on without it. They are like debts that I owe and if I don't pay for it, they loom over me. I was a little excited about finding this place because I've never been able to talk to anyone about this even though I honestly don't believe I'll be able to do it on my own. I've read every book about self harm I could get my hands, read individuals testimonies of their trials and triumphs, tried every alternative I've thought of or read and it may stop me from physically hurting myself but mentally I'm still in the same dark place. I keep forcing myself to dridge along for the sake of others but I want so badly to feel content and ok with myself. Instead of this intense feeling to destroy myself just to feel ok. How does this sound so crazy when I type it but so logical to my senses? I read so many of the posts on here and was amazed at how some people just really hit the nail on the head by putting the emotions that even I feel(that I thought I was alone in) into words. Sorry for blabbering on and thanks if you took the time to read all this. 
Hello! My name is Evan and I’m from a Harvard University research team that studies the thoughts and feelings that motivate self-harm behaviors.We are interested in recruiting people who use this subreddit to participate in our (Institutional Review Board approved) study.

The LineJust one. I'll just do one, then I'll stop. I'll put down the razor and never pick it up. This is what I tell myself day after day. But just one is never enough. Never enough to satisfy me. Never enough to give me that sweet release. Just one becomes just one more. Then two. Then three. How many is too many?Where is the line?I've already crossed it. So I redraw it, again and again. Slicing into my skin. Wrist. Arm. Thigh. Why stop now?I've already failed myself. What's stopping me from continuing?From going deeper and deeper each time?Where is the line?Why just cut?Why not keep going, past the point of no return?At least then, I'll never be able to cut again. To break any more promises. To hurt any more people. To cross any more lines. Thanks for reading, if this is not appropriate for this sub or there is a better place to post this, please let me know.
I'm 25 now but I've been cutting off and on since I was 14. I stop for sometimes year at a time but when there is a major life change or disappointment, cutting is my go to.I stopped for 4 years, I didn't even think about it for 4 years. But now I have a horrible job that I have to stay at until June and due to a particularly hard work event I started again. I stopped for a month but I had a particularly bad interaction with my boss today so I did it again when I went home.I'm in therapy but I'm not going again until next Monday. I just feel really ashamed. I don't know why I feel like I have to do this, I guess it's a deeply ingrained habit. I also feel so much better in a way after I do it, like my anxieties are almost completely gone. I just feel a lot of guilt afterwards.It sucks to think this might be a life long problem. I just feel so weak that I can go so long without self harming and then get sucked right back into it easily.
I'm struggling. Really struggling. I went in for paranoid delusions. And I can hardly even sleep outside of there cause I'm so terrified. I have to go visit my parents in a few minutes and convince them I'm fine but I haven't stopped crying since I woke up. I'm 15 days clean and it's rough. I am so overwhelmed by everything and convincing everyone that I'm fine. I just want to do something. I don't know what. Something to make everything stop bothering me.
So much has happened in the past few days and it's a lot to take. My step-mom (also abuser) died, my grandpa is in the hospital and school stress is getting to me.  I plan to go my step-mom's viewing tomorrow but when she was alive she gave me so much terror and I'm afraid I'll feel that terror again plus I'm afraid it will terror memories of when my mom died when I was little.  
I've stopped cutting and burning myself about one month before coming here - to Tanzania. Since I am here I had almost never any urges... The change of enviroment from Europe to here really helps.
I realized that the reason I have been cutting recently is for the excitement of it. The thought of hurting myself excites me and I feel like nothing could make me happier. The longer I refrain from doing so, the more excited I become. Sometimes I start shaking from it....
Okay, so in the beginning of our realtionship, 11 months ago I was waiting for a fosterhome, had an ED, self harmed etc. I got better. Now he's the one with depression, anxiety and recently admitted to me he is self harming. He tells me when he's done it and I'm asking him to tell his therapist but he doesn't really aee it as a problem. What can I do to help my bf through this? Help him stip before it becomes too much of an addiction. Help him tell his therapist and so on. When I ask him to tell his therapist he just says "Maybe" becausr he is afraid his therapist will tell his parents and they'll take his stuff. I'm just so lost at what I can do to help..
I've self harmed since I was around 11 years old, when I was first diagnosed with depression. I know how to treat wounds and hide them too, in part because my mother was abusive (not that, at the time, I understood or even realized she had been - I was so gaslighted I had no idea how she had abused me, I just literally didn't remember her hurting me for a long time).A couple of times people saw my injuries, but I was able to shrug it off, "the dog jumped on me," "I don't remember," "a friend's fingernail got me when we were roughhousing." The only time I was good at lying was when it came to injuries.I wasn't even particularly depressed or suicidal when I did it. It was kind of like, being alone one moment reading a book, and next thing I know I'm in the kitchen, testing my arm against the various knives, then washing the knives and my wound, and bandaging up. The only real time I did it while upset was when I was 16, dragged by my mother to a family event, where most of the time they spent talking shit about me and laughing about it right in front of me, and when I protested, I was told how I was being disrespectful. I cut my leg with a pocket knife repeatedly in the back seat of the car, with headphones on but no music playing, to listen to my mother and stepdad continue the conversation.Now as an adult, I kind of notice, when I get these impulses, it literally feels like there's a dull ache where I'm meant to cut. Right now my right arm is so sore. I'm fighting to not do anything. There's no reason to cut. I'm fine. My life is fine. I'm free of my family's bullcrap.... But I can't get rid of the ache.
Last night, I cut myself after 3.5 months without any self harming and I feel absolutely terrible today. I made this post because I needed a safe space to talk about it.About 5.5 months ago I posted in subreddit saying I wanted to stop cutting. After two months of trying, I was finally able to stop. Things were going really good. I was still feeling the temptation to cut every once and a while, but I was always able to overcome it. I was still feeling a little depressed, but the fact that I was not self harming was giving me hope that I would overcome the depression as well.Last night I accidentally cut myself, and the feeling of it caused me to start cutting myself on purpose. 3.5 months was longest I had gone without self harming probably since I started first started self harming.  I really thought I had finally overcome it. Today I feel like a failure. I am trying to be positive. I tell myself I won't let this happen again, but I still feel awful.Thank you for listening.
I'm not sure if this is a good thing. I try to be careful with how much I drink as I have classes to go to and things to do so I can't afford to be too hungover, but I went through a bottle of vodka in about a week. At least the self harm is gone I guess, at least mostly. I've only done it once within the past month or so as opposed to almost daily a few months ago. I'm already seeing a therapist. Not really sure what I'm looking for here, just thought I'd put this out there. 
Hi all. I had a history of self-harm in high school and college but stopped approximately seven years ago. For those of you who are struggling, it gets better! Take each day as a fresh start and celebrate the finest victories. My arms have scars and I was wearing a short sleeve dress while teaching secondary students (ages 12-18). I knelt down to converse with a student and they asked, "Ms. Rymeswithmacarena, what happened to your arm?" I had no idea what to say. I could have started a discussion about this issue that some of my students definitely struggle with but I didn't feel like it was appropriate. It was totally unrelated to the lesson and I didn't want to have that kind of discussion without the guidance counselor present.I chose to say, "It's from a long time ago." It was awkward, and the student knew it but said, "Oh, okay." I redirected them to the task at hand and we moved forward.Ah! This shook me. What do I do when the next student asks? Is that it? Is there a better way?
Hi everyone  I most about two weeks ago that I'm having thoughts of cutting myself.  It still keeps crossing my mind.  I'm using the rubber band to help,  which is kind of helping.  But it's almost every day I'm thinking I just wanna do it see how it feels.  I know I'm depressed and having anxiety issues and busy.  But because I've never cut I have no idea why I suddenly want to.  I've self harmed in the past via hitting my head,  but these thoughts almost feel like it's taking over?  If anyone can clue me in as to why I have this urge all of a sudden that would help I think. I'm trying my best to stay away from sharp things.  I told my SO and a friend and will contact them if I'm really close to doing it (it helps to be held accountable by other people so far) But really it's stressing me out,  I'm waiting on a therapist to work this out as well.   I know I'm not suicidal,  I'm just really tired and balled up with anxiety and overworked (working 12 days in a row for internship and work).  I'm also sad and gahhh idk...
I've gone as far as buying the razors. I got the courage to tell my boyfriend that I bought the razors and he said he didn't want to hear anything about it. I should just end it make it easy for everyone. 
How do you get through the rough days? When you feel alone and a bother to people. I'm sick with stomach issues and lung issues, my dog is sick and i just feel like people are laughing at me. I don't have friends beside my husband who is at work. 
I sat on my bed watching my legs bleed last night and I realized I hold all my pain inside so I don't hurt anyone else. I take everyone else's hurts and sorrows and bury them into myself. All I want to do is take away everyone else's pain and help them. Maybe that's my purpose in life. Like the sin eaters of the past maybe that's my purpose. Maybe I'm ment to take others pain inside me so they can heal and have the life they deserve. The cutting is away to release all of it out like the sin eaters eating of the bread and drinking of the ale.
I have never had a doctor. Never had an exam. When my parents tried when I was a kid I faked through it thinking I don't need to stick out anymore than I already did. I used to try straight suicide but today at work I broke down. I couldn't keep acting. I left work drove 30 min away from town so no one would know. I bought a blade and some rubbing alchol and tried to cut. (I've always seen myself as a jumper or hanger.) I ran the blade across my skin and it hurt a lot. But a warmth came over my arm. The blood started running and it felt like something changed. It feels strange and forced but I felt control. I know its bad but I am doing it. No one can stop me. Now my whole arm is bleeding with cuts and I have work tomorrow. I feel so shitty but its better than drinking because there is no hangover if I wake up. 
I have harmed for a long time, stopped for a few months but recently relapsed. I'm okay with that - it's all part of the process etc.. My problem is that I'm pretty sure I've broken my wrist (I've broken my foot before, I know the pain), and my usual doctor isn't in for a week, so I have to see someone new. The thought of seeing a new doctor literally makes me feel sick. I feel like I'm going to pass out. Any advice or tips on how to approach and deal with this would be great, I don't think I can wait too much longer.Thanks 
And I am using every ounce of strength I have to not whip out a razor blade and go to town, or find a hammer and beat myself until I can't feel anymore.He wouldn't want me to. He would feel so bad to be the motivation of any of my self harm. And he told me if I did it again we'd be through. And we're not through. He's still there... somewhere.
I don't think I'm ready to stop. I know its bad but is it really worse to feel emotional pain? Why is internal pain acceptable but doing something to help isn't.I just want a pretty girl to hold me tell me its going to be ok and pet my head. Sounds dumb but I don't care I know it would help me. 
really regretting it...
I don't really know where to go to get advice trying to help him so i figured this is the best place. I've known his reddit name for a while but out of respect i never looked at it. Today he mentioned some funny post he made so i told him i'd just go to his profile to find it. When i checked it out i saw he made a few pretty serious sounding posts in /r/depression and i looked a little deeper. While turns out he tried to kill himself with a knife a few weeks ago. I'm really worried and i don't know what to say or do but i want to help him. If anyone has any resources or advice i'd really appreciate it, i really don't want to lose him.
More triggering than those small yet poignant reminders that you don't mean anything to anyone; not anyone?
I have been obsessively self harming myself, wither by stabbing myself in the leg with safety pins, pencils or anything sharp that I can get my hands on, I have been tearing off my own skin out of being upset with something, if I try to stop either one of these behaviours I start chewing on the inside of my mouth until I bleed or I start tearing off my toenails.I don't know how to stop this vicious cycle but I just want it to fucking stop.
i was 6 months self harm free, i was so proud of myself, i even celebrated with my mom, but money has gotten unbelievably tight and i cant handle the stress anymore, i relapsed, i tried to reach out to my mom, i don't have a phone so i sent her a facebook message, after waiting all day she finally saw it, but didn't respond, i feel like such a failure, i hate myself so much.
Thanks, sis, for the advice :/
Hi everyone, I'm new here.  Lately i've been going into a depressive cycle.  I'm busy with work, school and an internship as well as dealing with transitioning (m-f) things are going well in that respect.  But i can feel myself going deeper int odepression every day and I've been having thoughts of possibly cutting myself.  I've never done anything like this before, and i'm not sure if I just want people to know how i'm feeling or what...So idk where to go from here; i'm pretty sure i'm not going to but I'm trying to learn why I may have the urge to and ways to not do it.
I was five years clean until a month ago. I'm not coping with the depression or anxiety like I once did.  Now, I find myself aching to bleed. No one knows really.  My husband caught a glimpse and threw out my knife (like that would stop me) and I'm too ashamed to admit to him or anyone else that it's  continuing. How do I stop again? I've forgotten all I did in the past to stop... I'm just a failure. 
     I have an 11 year old daughter that is sort of an oddball. She was at her mom's this weekend, got her clothes dirty and had to change in front of her. She was being apprehensive about it and then her mother saw scratches on her stomach. There were a few more on her leg and it seems like she just started experimenting with it.      Her mom and I split up when she was very young and her mother hasn't been able to see her very often because of work. I haven't had a chance to talk to her yet because she won't be home until tonight.      I'm looking for ways to understand why, any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
i have the scars to prove that self-harm has certainly been an option and now the urge is back after so many years. years of being over medicated. i know i need a little medication. however, i need to feel. the self-hate is sooooooo huge. scared, alone, angry, sad. 
I haven't seen her since November, but I do not want to cut myself because of her.  Her genuineness surrounding not wanting me to hurt myself stuck with me.
I gave up cutting awhile back but lately everything is a reminder as to why I'm nothing to nobody. Everybody is always so fake and use you as a means to an end. Use you as a scapegoat. So two-faced and insincere. Even after giving my all and trying to improve on my faults(and making some progress I feel) it isnt enough to make any difference. I don't know what the fuck I'm trekking up this goddamn hill for. The only thing holding me back is the backlash and threats I'll get if my boyfriend notices. But what is he doing to try to help me through this? What does anyone to show they care or appreciate? It seems though it may be unfortunate but true, the only person who gives a damn about you is you. And so if no one else can be there for me, I have to be in whatever way I know how. 
I have been cutting myself as a coping method to my depression and anxiety for 5 or 6 years now, and the loneliness has finally taken its toll. I no longer want to be a burden on my friends or rely on this destructive method to get by. I have tried multiple different medications to help stabilize my moods but none have really made a big difference. Over the past year I have tapered down from my high dosage of Zoloft and for the first time I feel as though I may benefit from talking to someone with experience about this. So I signed up with my University's health and wellness center and have made an appointment.I still have a few weeks before the appointment but I'm really nervous and scared. Every time I've talked to someone in the past I have downplayed it because I wasn't ready for help and didn't want to admit how much of an issue it was. I guess I'm posting this to reach out and see how you guys have dealt with talking to a professional, because it's a really scary step. 
It's usually very controllable at school, there aren't many triggers there, but at home some things simply set me off... I've given myself migraines after running off to my room and punching myself in the head several times. Advice?
I had to drop out of schoo because of my self harm. now I'm about quit my job, some people there trigger me so much. Especially this faggot I work with I hate this person. He bullies me for no reason. I don't know what to do. Maybe I'll just find another job but there is always a trigger.  I'm thinking of falling my moms footsteps and just ending this bs. I have no reason to live.I want to cut so bad. On somewhere obvious just to show everyone who I work with how sick I am. Maybe i'd get fired, I don't care. I can't keep on.Well I failed. 2 weeks down the drain. What am I supposed to do? I can't run from my problems but I can't deal with a bully, not now. I can get another job very easy, should I get aaway from this tool? iM Sure there are going to be more triggers else where
First... yes, this is a throwaway account, but I'll come back and check and reply if anyone does post anything.Second... if you read all of this... thanks for your time.I'm sitting at my dining room table right now... watching @Midnight... watching my wife sleep.  Feeling empty, lonely, disgusted, sad.  Sad because I've made so many mistakes throughout my life.  Sad because I've failed at so many things I've tried.  Whenever I get mad at myself, I eat.  When I make a mistake, I eat.  When I try to pick myself up and feel like why should I try because I'll just fail again, I eat.Four days ago, I weighed myself and I was the most I've ever weighed in my life.  395 lbs.  I stand at 6'3, but THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE POUNDS.I have depression.  Diagnosed 15 years ago.  Tried living and coping with it, but things came to a head when I had a mental breakdown at work, and my wife discovered I'd been having inappropriate conversations with 3 other women on Facebook.  Funny... I'm actually sitting in the exact-same spot in my house where, after she left, I considered suicide.  What saved me?  A phone call from my mom.  My wife came home and we spent months in marriage counseling.  Turns out, we both had issues.  I'd let my own depression make me believe I was so worthless, I couldn't tell my wife that I felt neglected when the intimacy stopped, and I vented to other women.  I'm sooooooo thankful we worked through that, but we're right back where we started.  She is working too hard and has no energy or time for me, and I'm afraid to say anything about it.  So I eat.I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist now, and I'm on meds, and it helps sometimes.  But for the most part, I'm floating.  The only time I feel happy is at work, because I actually feel appreciated and needed.I've talked to some friends, and they tell me to reflect what I have to live for, but all I keep thinking about is how they all deserve better than having to deal with me.  I've actually found myself reflecting, more than once, how my wife deserves a better husband and my daughter deserves a better father.So I eat.As an example... here's today's food journal.BREAKFAST: McDonald's - sausage & egg biscuit, bacon egg & cheese McGriddles sandwich, hash brown, iced coffee.LUNCH: leftover red beans & rice from home, sweet potato fries and a milkshake from Red Robin.DINNER: huge bowl of angel hair pasta with pesto sauce.LATE NIGHT SNACK: Pringles, one slice of Domino's Brooklyn style cheese pizza, one cup of Maruchan Instant Lunch noodles, Dr. Pepper.I've tried exercising so many times and failed or hurt myself.  Now, I think about taking a walk or stepping into a gym and it triggers my emotions.  I cry, thinking about how I have no business even trying.So I eat.As I type this, I'm even steadily thinking about things to eat in the house.I wish someone could help me escape this fog and inject some motivation into my life.  But I know it has to come from me.  I have to find it within myself.But, can I?Am I worth saving myself?  Am I worth someone else saving me?  I question this every single day.  And when I can't find the answer.... I eat.
Hey guys, I just need to tell someone this, and who better to tell than a bunch of people I don't know on the internet. I've been self-harming for many years, but I thought I was really over the hard part of not cutting myself.  My SO has been really supportive and he is why I've been working so hard to not cut, though I do still really struggle with other ways of SH.   I can't tell my SO cause he has a really big important presentation tomorrow and I don't want to distract him.  I've been really stressed and anxious about school and life and I just snapped tonight.  I cut, and though it isn't really bad or anything, I still feel shitty.  In 4 days it would have been two years of not cutting.  Thanks for listening.  
My habits with cutting are pretty predictable. The urge for me to cut comes the heaviest when I am feeling the most sexual. Is this normal?
I'm tired of feeling nervous about people seeing my scars. I'm tired of having to hide them. I'm self harm free for 10 months but I regret it so much. The consequences haunt me everyday and make me sad because I can't meet people without feeling anxious they will see them and judge me. That is all.
I feel guilt for animal deaths I feel I caused. I want to suffer for what I put them through. l
I started self-harming again last night. I'd been good for 16 days beforehand after I made a promise to myself and to my friends that I sincerely wanted to get better, and that I was done forever. I didn't want the attention, or the validation, or the acceptance of cutting as a method of coping anymore. I don't even know why last night happened, I just know the urge was there and I gave into it. I'm trying to reclaim that past hope, but I'm starting to worry that the determination I felt was just a phase in a never-ending cycle. And I'm scared that cycle will slowly control more of my life in the future, keeping me from success, happy relationships, etc.... Do you guys ever feel this way?
The meeting went ok work was hell tho the cook was yelling at me and a co worker yesterday my co worker put her two weeks notice in cause of it we talked to our boss she thought it was wrong to yell at us for stupid shit so she's gonna talk to the cook that yelled at us I almost put my two weeks notice in but didn't cause of my child I need money but anyways I don't want to work today cause I have to work with the same cook today I'm scared she's gonna ether yell at me again or talk about yesterday I did end up cutting last night cause of it idk what to do 
I gave up cutting and I haven't really been all that tempted in the short time to pick it back up. I miss it sometimes, I've done it so long.  In public I need to hurt myself to make it. Snapping rubber bands, pinching myself, hitting walls. It calms me down so much. Is this something I'm going to have to live with now? The need to hurt myself to calm down. And yes it is a need. 
So here is the run down. I (18)am currently in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend (17). We live about an hour and half away from each other so we usually only end up seeing each other every other weekend. She has been suffering from depression for about 3 years now and has had a single incident of mild cutting of her wrists. When her parents found out, they took her to the mental hospital and she was there for a week. She often tells me how this was the worst week of her life because it made her feel like a crazy person. After the week was up, they promptly drugged her up on anti-depressants. She has been on them ever since but has been slowly weaning off them under advice from the doctor.Currently, our time together is always perfect and we never have any issues and for this I am grateful. However, when we are apart her texts reveal the dark side of her emotions as the depression takes hold. She often times tells me about how fat and useless she thinks she is and how ugly she thinks she is. Even though all of those are the exact opposite, it results in her being extremely angry at herself and wanting to cut to provide relief to said anger.The reason I am making this post is for advice on what to do in this situation. I desperately want to help her in any way I can and prevent her from resorting to cutting. While it does provide her misguided relief, if her mom finds out, it will mean another trip to the hospital which will just make things worse. I wish I could just step in and get her the treatment she needs which is a good therapist but I can't because of her parents.

I used to directly self-harm years ago (in my late 20s now), and haven't had urges for ages. Now I find that I am doing other, stupid, very indirect things to harm myself: eating tons of food at night in order to validate how fat I feel, not brushing my teeth knowing it will suck eventually, etc. Anyone else struggle with taking care of yourself post-self-harm while still depressed? Any help appreciated. 
I supper stressed out I have someone on Reddit not on this Reddit but another one stressing out talk about my messed up relationship that I'm not ready to get out of there's no abuse etc he just might be cheating on me or two timing rn he's not causing this urge to cut its the meeting I have Wednesday and what the person is saying no it's not bad we r just arguing rather I should leave him or stay but I'm going through to much stress to worry about what's going on between me and him
I am sick with a cold but determined to see my friends at the library even tho I might not be able to cause its for me and my pca only I am stressed still about the meeting on Wednesday but so far I have not cutted yet thought of it but one I should stop cutting is not good and two I am due for a phy check up soon and my other old cuts are still healing. 
I'm not really good with words, so I'm just going to start by saying this: I recently found out my SO self-inflicts. We've been together for a month, and I love her a lot. It hurts whenever I see her scars and wounds. I want to try and help her, but I have no idea where to begin. If I notice she's anxious I'll hug her and tell her I love her but I wish I could do more.What do people do that really help? Thank you. You are all amazing and beautiful people.
 You can skip to last paragraph if you dont want to hear rant . I recently got contacted by my ex friend a lil more then friends though. We promised to never talk again because we are so toxic together. We bring each other so much pain. Its actually quite amazing we know eachother because of all the people we can never bring joy to one another we love the pain we cause each other. I love her though but she really hurt me. I tried to commit suicide and after I got back from hospital she insulted me and hurt me really bad and we agreed to never talk again, pretty much.She contacted me saying sorry pretty much. She knows I'm to weak to reject her or ignore her. It took a few days but I finally summed up the idiocy to respond to her. I accepted her apology then kind of told her off. I also told her we can't talk because it will cause both of us pain but I begged her to come back anyways after saying we can't talk. Now to the title of this post. I want to tell her if she doesn't come back to me I'm going to start cutting again. I miss her so much and I know she misses me but we will cause eachother so much misery. I need her back, I don't care about the pain I want her in my life again. I miss her complaining, I miss her hurting me. I miss it, we met before I became crazy.
I am three days clean of cutting so far I am happy about that but I have a meeting with my pca and my mom with a few others I am stressed out about it cause I've been meeting up at the library with my friends when the pca takes me there she don't know and I cant really meet up with friends but its the only time I can be alone with them and be myself anyways one day she saw one of them with me but before that I had maybe 4 friends she knew about that but I just said that I ran into them all but that one friend is one of them but I am scared she's going to tell my mom.
He has mental illnesses that play a great part in his decision to dump me over the phone, but I still feel fucked. One night, I stayed at his dorm room till midnight because we were having so much fun, and the next day, he was triggered into an emotional episode that completely nullified any feelings for me and now I'm alone again. It took me a whole year after the prior emotionally and physically abusive relationship ended to be open to attempt dating again, and now I'm back as square one. I've been wanting to kill myself for a few months, and I can't stop thinking about it now more than ever. I told him I wouldn't hurt myself, but I just want to stop it all. I can't trust myself to be in anymore relationships. I am just done. I cut myself again and I'm bleeding everywhere.Can someone please give me suggestions to distract myself?

I used to self harm ( Ive only ever self harmed using razors and other sharp objects) way back in middle school when I was around 12. throughout highschool I probably only gave in twice at the most. Now that Im a freshman in college, ive already gone on cutting "rampages" twice and its only the first semester. I dont really know what to do or who to talk to. Ive never told anyone about my self harm and I dont think I am ready for that nor do I think I will ever be. How can I get anonymous help so I can cope better without having to self mutilate? 
I really want to relapse. I've been holding a flame over my hand to feel something but I haven't cut in a while. 
Long story short, I was struggling with feelings of intense loneliness tonight and as a result I accidentally "overdid it" a little. Nothing life threatening, but it scared the living daylights out of me. I'm so ashamed that I've let it get this bad. I should've grown out of this crap ages ago, but I can't help it; I just feel so damn alone, like things will never change, and I can't deal with it anymore.I'm really, really sorry if this is annoying or stupid or something, you guys. Most of the time I just lurk but I really needed to let it out tonight.
I'm about ready to cut cause of my mom this situation just adds on more stress 
Mom said I need to start loosing weight said my belly is getting real big it bugs me a lil but mostly it's that she said maybe we got to get the iud out I'm scared if I do go the doctors will c my cuts or my mom
I don't want to work but I have to 4-7 eastern time I'm in mn but anyways I hurt from Tuesday still and I'm a lil bummed out and depressed no I'm not diagnosed with depression tho sometimes I feel like I should  

There's been so much going on lately.  I've got a paper due tomorrow and I haven't started yet, I'll see my abuser Saturday, my car is going and I'll have to spend all my money to get a new one and I don't even like my bf. I'm so stuckBut I failed at cutting.  Long story short, I broke my piggy bank on accident and I picked up a piece and tried to cut myself with it, but it didn't work.
I don't think id never be able to stop cutting this helps sometimes and venting sometimes but im about to loose hope.
Hello, I haven't posted here before, so I'll give a little bit of back story. 21 y/o from Australia. Been depressed here and there throughout my life, only really started cutting about 3 months ago. I haven't done it a huge amount, really a bit over a dozen cuts are currently pinky-red.Tonight/this morning, about an hour ago, I did it again. Four more on my left bicep, and one small one on my forearm. Now I'm just staring at them. I thought maybe I was passed this... It's odd, I had a bit of a shitty day but it wasn't that bad compared to some of them. Maybe it was just a cumulative thing. 
I was going to post this on /r/depression instead, but then decided to come here and focus more on the self harm aspects. I feel numb basically. Today and two days ago I relapsed for the first time in over a year. I don't know exactly when the last time I had done it was, but it had definitely been quite a long time for me which is something that makes me feel even worse about it. Anyway, I don't cut. I scratch and it's something that I've "had control of" on and off. Which I guess means I don't have control of it at all.. I don't know. I just feel empty and lonely and I don't know what else to do anymore. In all honesty, I don't know what the point of this post even is, but I still feel the need to post it. I'm sorry.
I messed up ;( my mind was racing
im a few days without cutting but stress just keeps building up and I have the urge to cut but im talking to a close friend. 
Send your support. This is going to be real tough for me. Real tough. Its gotten to a point where I do it just so I can feel something; I'm so numb. I don't really even want to quit but I need to change.I'm going on a date this week with this girl I don't know. I'm pretty nervous but its an added level because of my self harm and she knows my family pretty well. I decided to go see a movie because it'd be dark and it eliminates chance of seeing my scars. I'm just clueless on how to act because its my first time on a date. Please help me.
Cut again. I felt like I had to be punished. I deserved every cut, all the pain. It's the only way for me to feel better. 
the last few weeks I've been relapsing after 3 years without it but so many things is happening to me a guy I am with who is the father of our 1 1/2 year old son could be cheating on me again or two timing me with but I still love him but found a guy that is a friend that we both love each other but we are remaining friends cause I am with the father I want do brake up with him but I don't know for sure if hes cheating or two timing me I ask him but he just gets mad about it and not only that hes not commenting or liking pics of our son like he used to do all the time I need to know what to do and how to cope and stop cutting again and after that vent im thinking of it ;(       
I used to cut myself when emotionally distressed. Now I don't really feel distressed in any way I just want to change myself significantly. I'm not easily motivated and I was really motivated when I hurt myself. It's like the carrot and stick simultaneously.  I basically want to put goals and reminders into myself instead of just lines but IDK if I really should. Like I think it's an option that will likely work, but am uncertain as to if it's really a good option.
People think I stopped self harming over a year ago. In reality it's only been 6 months. I was too ashamed to tell anyone the last time I started up again. I've been really worried lately because sometimes when I think about harming myself the only thing stopping me is knowing that my boyfriend will notice if I open up the new first aid kit we bought for our new apartment...
Fighting with my BF and I don't even know why. He is just so angry at me but won't talk to me. I really want to hurt myself the only thing that is stopping me is I don't have any first aid supplies.Funnily enough I live behind a hospital so if I did enough damage I could just walk there.  I am crying so much I feel like I am going to vomit. 
Had a really rough day yesterday. For some reason the thoughts were coming on strong despite being relatively free from them for the better part of a year. Also had a pretty intense nightmare that night as well. Managed thru the day and knew that today would be better because there is always hope. Today I found out that my dad has cancer. I was expecting to hear that news but again there was the hope that i’d be wrong. Not sure how bad it is or what the outcome will be. My spouse is deployed and im home with a newborn. The situation with my dad is out of my control, all I can do is hope and pray for the best. I have been working on my social network and attending more activities and groups outside of the house in order to help keep myself active to prevent a relapse. With the urges that I had yesterday and the news today im hoping I can stay strong enough to make it thru. I talked to a friend when it got back which helped and I know that it’s not worth it. That it wont fix anything and that I have other options available to me. Tomorrow is another day and the sun will shine but tonight I just wish someone was here. 
Potential trigger warning first and foremost.----------------------------------------------------------------My girlfriend cut herself again tonight. She's been clean for months, though the first few weeks of college have really taken their toll. So-called friends have screwed with her so much and turned her into an incredibly introverted person, so much that she now struggles in every social situation to make friends, and is so struck with anxiety she's been unable to bring herself to join any societies.She's hit a point where it's spiralling her to the bottom, and I could just see in her eyes what it meant tonight. She's been down this road once too many times before, and I'd trade so much for her to find what she's looking for.Why does the world always fall down around the ones we love.If any of you have an outlook on this or words of advice you'd like to share, I really think she'd appreciate this right now.
Every time I see something that reminds me of her I want to self harm. It's been two and a half years and I can't help it. I haven't actually cut in over a year, but is seems the longer I fight it, the more I want it. Help?
I've been trying to quit. Failing though. This girl in my class she I don't know she looks at me. When I see her, I get so worried. I keep pinching myself and snapping my rubber band. I just feel the need to hurt myself so much when I catch her eyeing me its confusing the fuck out of me. I'm gay, I think, but I'm so attracted to her. I honestly am considering not going to my exam tomorrow because of her
I am an idiot and fucked things up with the first girl to truly like me ever. I am a 17m and just don't see the point. If it wasn't for my parents I would so happily end my life, I am tired of fucking everything good up.


So I have a lot of scars left from SH on my arms. Fortunately it's all in the past but I always feel self conscious about them and am afraid of wearing t shirts because I think that I won't be able to make new friends in college. However, I am tired of letting this addiction ruin my life, I want to feel beautiful and confident without being afraid of being judged or considered to be a freak/crazy. I would really appreciate it if you guys could share some tips on how to not care or your personal experience with not covering up the scars . Thanks!
In the last couple of years, I have increasingly had the urge to hurt myself when I get stressed (which is frequently, as I am a working college student). I get scared whenever I have these thoughts, but can't stop them. I've started scratching and biting myself, silly as it may sound, because I don't want to leave marks from cutting. Even the pain of doing these small acts serves to immediately relieve my emotional stress. In the past, I've used occasional smoking to similar effect, but neither of these are options I want to turn to. I want to know a healthier way to manage my stress. I've tried deep breathing and meditating, but haven't found those to be effective when I'm panicking. What are some other things I can try for quick stress relief (or long term habits to develop)? What has worked for you? Thanks much, everyone. 
I'm getting urges to cut right now so I'm making a vent post to calm myself downEvery now and then I get urges to cut myself, They usually happen when I'm feeling overwhelmed or anxious, I have only caved in about 3 or four times and the last time I cut myself was over a month ago, and the urges have slightly died down but I still get them from time to time.I know it makes me crazy but I think I should tell you all why I want to self harm. I want to cut myself because I hate myself, I have no social skills whatsoever, I can't even look people in the eyes when I talk to them, I'm 15 years old I should fucking be able to look people in the eyes by now, And I've always been a weird kid, I'll never be normal I'll always be 'that' kid. I  know this makes me crazy but I also want to cut to prove to myself that I can feel something, The only thing I feel is meloncholy, I wouldn't say that I feel down or that I feel happy. I just want to feel something, I must sound insane right now but that's why I want to hurt myself.I haven't cut many times, and the few times I have I didn't cut very deep,  I know that I must sound completely mental right now but I feel like a bitch because of this, when I read about other people self harming they cut really deep but I'm too much of a pussy to do that, and I feel like ungreatful because they are going through a lot worse things than me and what I'm worrying about is nothing in comparison, I've never had family or friends die, I've never had a serious illness, I have a home and an education and food and everything I could ever ask for, I should be happy, In comparison to everyone else my problems are nothing.Thanks for reading, take care and God Bless

That's how long I have til I get married. Six months. I desperately want to be stay clean for at least those six months, and hopefully longer. But it's so hard.It's been a year since he helped lead me to start dealing with something that happened to me four years ago on the 21st of this month. I've been struggling so much with those memories and I keep breaking my promise to myself not to give in again. I just can't stop telling myself that this time will be the last and that it will make me feel so good that I'll never have to do it again. And yet I invariably give in every time.
I haven't cut in so long, it'll be a year next month but everything has fallen to shit in the last two months and I have nothing and no one and I just want to feel something else for a few minutes I don't know what to do
Why am I like this? I'm in my mid 20s and I'm still cutting. Frequently. I stopped for three years, but then gave in when I started having a really hard time this summer. I can't even tell my counselor about it--I've tried, I cannot make the words come--because I'm so humiliated that I'm a functioning adult, and yet I'm still dealing with this. Everything I ever see on self-harm talks about teens. I am not a teen. I feel so stupid. Are there any other adults out there that deal with this? I know, logically, that I can't be the only one, but oh my goodness. It sure feels like it. 
Hi all--Like the title says, I've decided to go back into a treatment program specifically to deal with self harm. I made the decision today after putting it off for nearly a month, but I feel miserable. I know I need to go and get help, I know I need to stop cutting, but I don't want to do it. At the same time I'm sick of all the scars and hospital visits and lying, lying, lying about how I'm "just so clumsy!" when people ask what the hell happened. I've crossed lines I said I never would because of self harm and I hate that too.I dunno, I guess I just could use some support in encouraging me to go and that it is the right thing to seek out help. I've gotten so turned around with this that I almost feel I don't want to get better.
I feel a bit silly. But I think I might have been self-harming on and off for years without realising it.I feel silly because it's not what I picture when I think of self-harm - it's not cutting or anything like that. It's almost so tame as to be a bad habit; but the problem is that I think it's affecting my daily life, my interactions with people, my ability to do certain things, etc etc.I've also been doing it only when I'm stressed (and I'm stressed a lot), and despite how bad it makes me look (aesthetically) and that brief flicker of pain, the immediate aftermath of doing it feels vaguely 'good', or like I've 'accomplished' something somehow.I would prefer not to say what it is because I feel like an intruder, but given all I've said, is the thing I'm doing considered self-harm, or merely mildly self-destructive?
So today marks 4 months and a day that I have stopped self harming! I am so proud of myself for coming so far, and will continue to keep going and see how far I can get. I have had a few times that I have wanted to continue again, but decided it wasn't worth it, as for me it didn't do anything to help me. Just made me more depressed, but now that I have stopped I feel happy again and just free from that awful cycle of depression and self harm that I got so wrapped up in. Hopefully I can keep going and eventually make it 6 months self harm free. :)
I have PTSD and can't tolerate distress.  My self harm is not cutting it's different but I don't want to say what I do if that's OK.  I haven't done it in 2 weeks.  It's hard.  I'm committed to stay with it this time because I incapacitate myself when I engage in this behavior. Not being able to tolerate distress prevents me from working because I can't tolerate distress enough to look for a job.  My self harm behavior doesn't sufficiently lower my anxiety to the level where I can be functional like normal people so it's just as well I give it up.  Will DBT make it so I can tolerate distress again?  I did half a course once many years ago, but I'm thinking of going back to do the whole thing because I'm getting older now and I have to take care of lots of things now, and put the work into my recovery if  I expect to survive.  ETA: I just asked my therapist to find a DBT class for me.  Thank you for all the information and support.
im having a really bad day. i just had a tantrum and a complete breakdown. i dont even know why, i had a fight with my mum and then my dad and im just so stressed out. ive been dong so well though. i dont know how long ive been clean, i think a bit over 3 weeks maybe ?. i know it wasn't last Thursday, or the thursday before that but i tink it might have been the thursday before that. anyway, i just dont want to disappoint anyone if i cut again but im starting to think i should cut. ive had so many relapses. i dont now if i should do it again. it's getting hot latley, i cant cover it all up forever but i feel like i should
the reason is ridiculous as always and my fit is already done. I got scared and told my boyfriend and he said he was extremely upset and disappointed in me. I feel shittier. 
I want to help her be the the amazing young woman I know she is but how can  I when I still have cuts healing. I tried so hard to shield her from the horrors of this world and still she ended up like me. I left  her abusive drug addicted father to give her a better life and she so much to be with him again. I'm at the point where I feel I should just take him back deal with the beatings.and rapes if she is happy. It's a no win situation. 
i used to but i find it hard to keep count. besides when you count how many days since you've last self harmed, all you do is think about it. sometimes i even feel guilty for not self harming in a while.
I have a fear of talking. I don't mind being around people its just the talking. I can't do it. My mind gets filled with suicidal thoughts and bad bad thoughts. My mind screams at me telling me to shut up, I'm a freak, everyone hates me. Stuff like that pretty much. And when I'm done talking I get gripped with regret. Even the smallest interaction ordering a sandwich at chick fil a I'm terrified to talk to the cashier. Its been like this so long everyone kows me as the person that doestn talk. I can't do it so I just don't talk. I think worse yet is its normal for me now.I can't function in this world if you can't talk to people and it smore then juts not liking to talk. or maybe it is just that. and im making it a big dealI was smoking pot and playing Nintendo at my friends and I just started crying because of the feelings. I cried. I've been selfharming and I don't even know how to stop. Its the most addicting thing I've ever done.  
She kept wanting me to schedule a doctors appointment for a "rash" on my arm, so I finally just said "I lied to you. It's not a rash, they're burns," and the conversation ensued from there. It wasn't a bad discussion, she's just really concerned, but regardless, was not an easy conversation to have. Idk if this will be good or bad for me in the long run but at least I don't feel like I need to hide it from her anymore. 


Throwaway because she knows my reddit. The problem is my girlfriend cuts and doesn't really try to hide it because she doesn't think theres anything wrong with it. Obviously there is something wrong with it since she's hurting herself and I don't want her to but how can I show her that it's not good? One time I tried to tell her it wasn't good and she said "well you smoke weed (from time to time, not constantly), its the same as that, just a coping thing to like help me". I just want her to not hurt herself anymore...
My therapist says this is a form of self-harm, but I'm not so sure. I do it to calm myself down, and also to 'fix' myself. Lips, breasts, arms, nipples. Anything in easy reach. Starting to get ugly scars that won't heal. Got worse when I moved to somewhere with a really dry climate. Anyone else do this? 
It helps me. 

Is it weird I enjoy looking up triggers? I feel guilty after..opinions welcomed
This morning my dad asked how I burned my arm. He could only kind of see it from where he was sitting and I told him it was a grease burn from making a cheeseburger. He seemed to accept that answer until lunch when my brother noticed it."Dude, what happened to your arm!?""I burned it.""How many times!?""One.""Yeah, right!" (there are multiple burns on my arm).I just shot him a look and he said, "Do you not want to talk about it?" I nodded and that ended the conversation but I doubt my dad failed to read into it. He didn't say anything about it afterwards, but he knows I've been depressed, not to mention that he's a licensed therapist. I'm not even really sure what to ask. What do I do from here? maybe? 

I'm having a really difficult time with my relationship right now, and I panicked and ran back to the only thing I could think of that makes me feel a little better. I don't really know where to go from here. I'm afraid I'm going to fall back into it. I'm sure my boyfriend has seen my scars before, but we've never talked about it. He's out of town right now (part of the reason why we're having such issues), and I don't him to come back home to me like this.
I realized that spending my time more productively and having an actual routine again, would really help me. My days have been filled with a whole lot of nothing. I never challenge myself or work to the bone. I seem to avoid just about any task that requires one to. I'm a lazy ass. And i continue to do certain things, like make obviously bullshit excuses to not brush before bed some nights. I can't remember the last time i've done laundry. I put off so much. I'll just drop off enough of it today, finally, and de-clutter at home, exercise more, and read and learn and make myself aware of stuff that's actually useful. 
Was at the park throwing a frisbee with my room mates and a young girl and guy came up to us and asked to join, which they did. Upon talking to them it was obvious they were high as kites (arms covered in track marks and the girl was being crazy). Anyway, other than track marks the girls arm was notably and deeply scarred all over, and it really shook me up. I have a lot of really dark and deep scars on my thighs that I keep covered, but I guess seeing them on someone else was really weird for me. Does anyone else experience this kind of thing?  
I stopped cutting in june and stopped getting urges for a long time, but got the urge again yesterday and cut for the first time in months. I'm really scared that I'm going to start cutting regularly again, and am fighting the urge to cut as i type this now. I haven't been depressed in months either and am terrified that it's coming back :( has anyone else had 'one time relapses' where they cut just once and manage to fight the urge to continue cutting afterwards? I don't want to start this all over again :( 
what do I do? I don't even know what the fucks wrong with me! I've been having urges for about a year now, Ive only caved in a few times and haven't cut for about a month now but the urges are still there. I don't really see any reason not to self harm except that people will notice the cuts. I promised one of my internet friends that I wouldn't self harm for 5 months, I kept my promise but after 5 months I caved in.How do I stop my urges? I tried using an elastic band and snapping it against my wrist but its not really making a difference anymore. 
I've had a history of cutting. I have gone off and on for about three years now, with each relapse getting progressively worse. I had thought I quit, but a month ago I relapsed and... here I am.Today I was ~~a little~~ a lot overwhelmed and there was a knife there and I just went to town.So, it turns out the knife was a lot sharper than I anticipated. I should probably get stitches for it, but I'm under 18 so I'd have to tell either of my parents about it, which would be... undesirable. Fifteen minutes later I finally told someone-- a friend-- that I had relapsed again, and they were ~~a little~~ very concerned and worried but they were also supportive. I felt bad for making them worry. I want to quit and I'm going to quit today. Again. It's gonna be great.I made an index card. At the top I wrote in bright green highlighter "PEOPLE LIKE YOU." because I struggle with self-loathing and self-esteem issues and all sorts of fun stuff. Silly, but that isn't the important part.Underneath it I have prepared a tally chart for every day I refrain from hurting myself. I marked tomorrow in advance because I'm not gonna let myself hurt myself tomorrow.When I get to day 100 there's going to be a huge-ass self-praise party thrown and attended by yours truly. I will make myself a cup of tea and pat myself on the back and it will be fantastic.I'll be able to wear shorts again someday; Google says that most scars fade eventually.That friend of mine's concerns and efforts won't be wasted because I'm never ever doing this again.It's going to be fucking awesome (but I'm actually terrified). 
I shouldn't have. I really shouldn't have. But the bus stop drops me off from the dollar store after work, and I went in, and bough a pack of refill blades for box cutters. I love them. They're easy to keep ahold of so I don't *have* to go deep. I don't want to go to the hospital again, so cutting deeply/need stitches is not an option.Fuck. I have to do it. It goes 'round and 'round in my head and I keep thinking it's not harmful. It's only harmful physically to me and it's my body so why can't I just do what I crave so intensely?Please help. The urge is so intense.
So I've been seeing a therapist for this would be my 2nd week and well I don't think its for me. I am open and honest with the therapist but I don't get it. How could therapy ever help? I feel so far past help and honestly I don't want it. I already made my mindI feel like I look at my therapist and see evil. She's a nice lady or whatever but I felt bad vibes or something. That may sound crazy but I can't dealSo is therapy for everyone? I can never understand how this will ever help me. I'm regardless of what you say going to cancel the appointments. 

I have my Math mid term exams, starting tomorrow. I've not studied enough; my friends are wondering why I keep asking them how to solve easy sums. I know I'm smart; I passed last year with 100%. I can solve hard sums and ace everything normally, but now, I feel like an idiot. I've been mild to moderately depressed, and I self harm. I want to punish myself for my stupidity. My mother saw my marks from scratching myself really badly, and she yelled at me for being an idiot. Today, I just cracked a really tough sum which everyone was having trouble with, but my mom got into a fight with me later on, making my mood go straight down. I tried talking to her about it, and asked that I wanted to see a therapist. She got furious and told me that I was perfectly normal. I'm afraid; I don't want to disappoint everyone with an A. Everyone in my family, and my teachers expect an A*. I'm panicking, and I'm punching myself in the face, now. Help...Sorry if this seems broken up; I'm trying to crack a stupid 2 mark sum......
I can't stop the thoughts anymore, I wasn't cutting because I felt like I couldn't hide it from people but I know I can now. It's been over a year since I last cut/burned and it's time to start again. I go to work, I try to make friends I try to talk to people, I try to get girls interested in me. I'm just so fucking unattractive, pathetic and I'm not interesting enough for anyone to give a fuck about what I have to say. I'm just a boring fucking piece if shit. Yaya someone's talking to me and I'm having a conversation but not without me saying something really fucking awkward! I'm useless and socially inadequate. No one will ever want to spend the rest of their life with me. No one will ever love who I am, no one cares who I am, I'm nobody and it's always going to be that way. My fucking family members don't even listen to what I have to say! I have to say things over and over, what I say doesn't matter, what I believe doesn't matter. I'm close minded to them. I'll always be unattractive and awkward, no one will ever truly care.I fucking suck.Edit: Attractive people get everything in life and I'm not attractive. I spam likes on Tinder and rarely get any matches. I'm fucking pathetic.
It's not exactly huge, but it's about 1 x 1 inches. It's very red and weepy, it's where my wrist bends.I'm struggling really badly with covering it up...plasters peel off as its in a mobile area, bracelets don't quite sit that low. I usually would use makeup but the wound is fresh and sore. I can't let my parents see tomorrow, they'll be so mad. Does anyone have any ideas I may not have thought of?
I'm trying I don't know what the hell is wrong with meThere's this troubling place where I don't know whether or not I'm allowed to put certain labels on myself (abused) and I don't know why I care (it doesn't change anything) and I want my family to like me but that will just never happen and then I read that back and think "look at all the lovely conversations you've had with them what are you talking about you're creating the whole problem yourself" and last weekend my (male) roommate jokingly slammed his fist down and yelled and I jumped bad and he also made a joke about how I'll always need his validation and I'm seeing my family soon and they won't be mean or maybe they will but nothing will change They'll still be alcoholics and I still won't be forgiven and I'm so sick of myself and my Not Abled, but not Traditionally Disabled body And today I was at the gym and was crying my shoulder was spasming so bad because what's life without chronic pain nobody will ever really acknowledge because there was never space for that, and I thought, if I just keep going even though my shoulder is hurting so much and my knee is buckling, then that will cover the self harm thing, maybe, the urge, orFuckI fucked it upIs quitting a myth?
One my largest triggers is the need to punish myself. I'm a bad person and I need to be hurt.
I believe that she cares about me and wants to help, but I also can tell she talks to more out of obligation than because she really wants to. She did everything she could to not let me know she was on campus already then made up excuses not to see me. When we had concert band rehearsal, she avoided me until I approached her. I can't handle a half assed friendship right now and she's too nice to tell me that she doesn't want to be friends, so I said it for her. She asked if I was honest about where I got the burn on my arm. I said no, I wasn't. Of course she was concerned, but all she seemed to focus on was the fact that I lied about it in the first place. She couldn't understand why I wouldn't want her to know that other than just not trusting her. Definitely not what I needed on top of the pain of ending that friendship, but I was kinda drunk so at least there's that. 
Up until mid-August I lived in a pretty nice sober living home(for my mental illness, I'm not a alcoholic or drug addict, but they let me stay there for support and medication monitoring). I lived there for just over a year.I moved back in with my mom, and now, there aren't any consequences of "safely" cutting. Because at the house I had a contract that I would not cut myself, and that if I did, I would possibly be kicked out and almost surely hospitalized.I did hurt myself there a few times within the past year. I think only like 2-3 times cutting and one time overdosing when my meds weren't properly managed.The last time I hurt myself was this past March, where I overdosed on Ativan.Now I'm living with my mom. Things are stressful, I'm trying to work again and am taking one community college class..I just want to cut. I need to. I crave that release, that CONTROL. I need it. I don't want to tell my therapist.You see, my case manger at my therapist/psychiatrist's office told me that I'd fuck up at my mom's house and that I should not have left the sober living(but I left due to financial reasons). So if I cut, I have to keep it a secret, which I hate, that causes so much anxiety and shame.But I miss it. I miss it so much. I don't want to do it deepy/bad, but I just NEED it. I don't know how to cope. I'm unmotivated and don't feel like using coping skills. I just want to see blood. Luckily I see my therapist tomorrow. So I just have to make myself wait until then.I don't know if I'll be ok. 
'Dream or Die' kickstarter campaign. If the goal of around $50,000 is reached, then I'll be able to leave my daily struggles behind me of cutting short my numerous creative arts and small business pursuits because of a lack of funding. I would reach out to family, friends, and potentially the media. Might even do it as a huge art piece. It would cause such a controversy that I can see it gaining enough publicity to work. I wouldn't be the most proud of doing it this way, but much else has failed and I simply haven't the patience anymore.If the goal isn't reached, I would end my life. It's incredibly selfish, but I'm going crazy, shit sucks. It's honestly perplexing to me, and while it is a dark thought, I wanted some feedback on it from outside sources that are more neutral to my situation that any of my friends or family would be.Thank you.
This is kind of dumb, but I feel like I need to reassure myself that I'm thinking incorrectly. I'm not particularly depressed, though occasionally I feel aimless. I have an anxiety problem, but I manage it well by myself. I used to be a cutter, and I kind of miss it. If I could, I think I would start again to keep these thoughts at bay. I keep thinking about killing myself. Seems silly simply because I like my life a lot. It just seems like something to do, because I am very tired. Perhaps tired is not the right word... Bored? I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.Alcohol hells some, but that's hardly a solution. I'm not going to, because it's stupid and I'd probably fail. I don't want to hurt my SO like that. My life is awesome, and I know these are just passing thoughts. I won't call any help lines. I just needed to vent, really. tl;dr: Mildly suicidal, but not dumb enough to try.
I have been cut-free for 4.5 months and the temptation of cutting just gets worse and worse. I think about it so much that I need to sometimes stay up late just so I can quickly fall asleep. For me it's the worst when you lye in bed trying to sleep. I was at work yesterday and the one intern left a box cutter on his desk. I stood there opening and closing the box cutter, pulling out the blade, sitting it down on the desk, seeing if it was sharp, clean, exct. I came so close. I had to hide it from myself in a drawer in his desk. I came way too close. I am proud that I did not do it. But that feeling of wanting to cut is awful and seems to get worse. I don't know what to do.
So I didn't know where else to post this, but lately I have been pulling out my hair and I don't know why. I have also been biting the inside of my cheek as hard as I can and sometimes I scratch myself so hard I draw blood. My family has started to notice and honestly I just realizes I was doing it all about 2 weeks ago. I don't know what's going and I don't really have anyone to talk to about this
I'm just feeling the need to cut so I can release my stress and anxiety but I know I shouldn't. Any suggestions what else to do? Maybe I'll take a bath and just cry to release it all. What works for you guys usually?
A few weeks ago I burned myself with a lighter and have been ok since, but I'm starting school again, seeing people that I was once close with and I'm having a really rough time. I just went into the bathroom and scratched myself for a bit. Idk what I need here, maybe just someone to talk to would be nice. Thanks for reading. 
So I've been sober from self harm for probably a year or more. I stopped cutting a while back for my fiancé and turned instead to my eating disorder. Well, for the last 7 weeks, I've been in a treatment facility for eating disorder. About two weeks ago, I decided with my team of therapists that I needed to do some trauma specific therapy. It's been slow moving, but I was starting to finally get comfortable with discussing my past trauma and working through it. However, today my treatment team decided that there was not enough time left in my stay for us to continue my trauma work ethically. So, right as I'm ready to start opening up, they decided it's not the best plan. I felt awful. I felt rejected and betrayed. I feel like I cant trust my team any more. I feel angry for even believing this would work out. The whole situation brought up alot. With all the emotions brought up, my self harm urges skyrocketed. Really, all my urges jumped, but self harm the most. In a moment of weakness, I decided to self harm... I broke a year of sobriety over something I don't want to be upset about. I want to be angry at myself, but mostly I'm numb. But now what do I do? Do I tell my team? Do I tell my fiancé? What the fuck did I do
I keep talking to my ex. He talks to me because he worries about me. Today I asked if I could go over and he said i shouldn't and I punched myself and puller my hair because I felt so stupid and rejected.I love him I need him I hate myself. Every time I hurt myself I feel like I deserve it.
I cut for the first time a week or so ago and I got stressed tonight so I cut again and I looked at the cuts and got scared I don't want to do this to myself please how can I stop, I've only done it twice and its scary. its satisfying to see the cuts and the blood beads coming out of them but I know how bad it can get.. I don't want self harm to become a serious issue for me. help please. my brain tells me to do it but I know I really shouldn't. please say something to convince me. help.
Pretty much the tittle. I'm so pissed off and hurt right now by the actions of some people. I've been consumed all day with "revenge" fantasies against them. Usually when this happens I resolve it by hurting myself. I honestly don't know how to cope. The people who've hurt me won't talk to me or apologize ever. I don't want to actually do anything to them, but I'm being consumed by anger. I've been working out a lot more the past couple days to deal with it, but it's not working that well. Does anyone have any advice?
It's been about 1.5 years since I last self-harmed. Yay! I really haven't had that much trouble with it since. I haven't thought about it in months, which is great.The choir I'm a part of started up again for the year about two weeks ago and one of the girls has noticeable self harm scars. (She's super nice, by the way. I think we're going to be friends) But anyway, for some reason, the sudden reminder has really shaken me up. All of a sudden I'm starting to have the feeling of kind of wanting to SH again. Not a lot, but once every day or two it will happen. Which is quite a change from it being several months since the thought had even occurred to me. I'm pretty sure that seeing this other girl and imagining her story/other things is what's set this off. I sincerely don't want to relapse (and I don't think I'm really going to), but I just want to head off this issue before it becomes a bigger one. Any ideas on how to cope/help reduce these thoughts and feelings?
Last night I pathetically took apart a pencil sharpener and used the razor. I loved it and I was happy that I was finally able to do it again. Obviously now I'm ashamed and upset that I oh so pathetically broke down like that. I can't talk to anyone about it...
I have been going through some really depressing times and i always say i wanna kill myself but i just cant and i always try to cut but i just cant no matter how hard i try and i'm that if i do cut myself ill lose whats left of my friends and i don't want that to happen but i cant get rid of this feeling of being worthless/loser in life.

Thank you everyone for your support. I thought about what I like to do for me. I remembered when I first bought my house free and clear a year ago as.a safe place for me and my kids. I had such hope and plans. My house was gonna be the prettiest on the block. The past few months I let the weeds get overgrown and the front look unkempt. After working 8 hours I came home and started to pull all the weeds, sweep, and clean it up. My back hurts but I feel good. 
A few weeks ago I posted here saying that I burned myself with a lighter, just slightly, not even really enough to leave a mark. Well recently I did it again. I felt almost ashamed that I didn't have the strength to hold it to my skin longer so I put more "effort" into it this time and well... I didn't mean to do as much as I did. I have a pretty large burn mark on my arm that's now scabbed over. It's very noticeable and I regularly have people ask me what happened to my arm. I lie to them of course. I used a lighter because knives leave scars and typically people don't jump to the conclusion of self harm when they see burns. The only person that actually knows what I did is a friend that I only know online. I haven't done it since but I can't say that there's no chance i'll do it again. But I digress, thanks for reading. 
A few days ago, I did an experiment on self-harming. I didn't know how deep you need to self-harm yourself.I told myself I could never do physical self-harm because I'm not that stupid or strong enough to do it. So I mostly just mentally harm myself with exhaustion of work or something else.That changed, yesterday. It was in the morning, I decide to test how deep the cut needed to be. The first wasn't that much of deep. It left a scar, somewhat a papercut scar.The next was when I was in the middle of work, and I decide to take a rest. Went to the pantry with a cutter. Tried to cut somewhere near the vein. It didn't left any scar or pain. I guess I was too coward to do it, so I left it with a red bruise.Today, I felt the need to cut, but I have no reason to. Went to the pantry again, cut deeper than the first cut, and I didn't notice that it actually bleed a little.A few minutes later, I saw the blood. And my thought was, I did it. That is the first true self-harm.2/3 cuts.I don't know if this is going to be frequent, but the urge to do it is always when I'm at work.Because. Of other reasons of my depression.
all my problems i used to suck all of it in.. i don't talk to anyone cause i feel embarassed about it. just recently, i started to self harm. and now i feel disgusted of my cuts and feel like puking when i thought about it.. my arm ache for that calm feeling when i cut. this feel of disgustion of myself is effecting myself and i don't know what i should do. 
I haven't cut in a couple of years... I think. As far as I can remember. Sometimes I dissociate and cutting used to help that, so maybe I've scratched myself here or there, or come close and I don't recall doing it. But right now, I get the urge to do it so strongly. And I won't, as much as it feels like the urge is killing me. My SO is far away, and he tells me to call him when I feel that way, but sometimes I just feel like I shouldn't go to him every time I feel bad. I have problems with that, and I already feel like I shouldn't be so dependent on him. He has so much going on in his own life and I want to give him time and space to handle his own problems too, without adding mine. On top of that I feel like I always whine about stupid things, and now I'm not even sure what it is that's making me feel so bad. I think I'm only able to keep myself from cutting because of how it would make others feel. I sit there staring at anything I could use to hack away and not think about it. And it hurts. I want to do it so badly and I wish I didn't care about how anyone else felt. I actually wish I could do it so I could feel better. 
today I went to the mall and went to a tattoo parlor to ask a few questions. I wanted to know how much it cost to get one up my shoulder. I guess its called a sleeve. They didn't really give me an answer just said that it depends on what I want and I accept that. Then I asked about tattoo'n over scar tissue. They asked to see the scared area, this is the first time I ever showed anyone my scars. I was kind of nervous and kind of expecting them to say something but they didn't they were cool. They told me it'd be like 2 years before I should get anything done so my skin would have more time to heal and nothing worse would occur to the damaged skin. I wonder what they think of me.

I don't need to hear that its bad, or any of that. I need to hear a logical argument for why I shouldn't self harm. I have convinced myself that it logically makes sense to do it and I need to hear otherwise.
Yesterday I relapsed after a long time... I think maybe 3 months?? I only really relapse when im at home. Im so nervous because I go back to college in 5 days and I know the scars will still be visible when I go up there... It's going to be hot and the scars are on my inner left ankle so the only way i'd hide it is with long pants. I just feel really disappointed in myself? Like I can usually cope better and I just kind of feel like I let myself down on this one and I just really don't know what to do? I guess i'm asking on tips to hide the scars until they heal but I'm also just kind of venting I guess? Sorry, i'm kinda new here...
Hi. I guess I don't really know what to say. I rarely talk about this because it's a... personal topic, I guess, yeah.I've been self harming on and off for a long time. I'd go through bouts where I would literally cut every single day. At one point I actually ran out of room, because my thighs were covered. Longest time between relapse was a year. I'm currently 206 days free after a particularly bad relapse.But it doesn't feel like an accomplishment. I mean - I'm so freaking close to beating my longest streak, you know? But it feels like nothing. Like nothing's changed. I find myself going through really bad moments, where I feel like I can't breathe and that I hate myself and just... that the world won't change, and I won't either and it will pretty much just, suck forever, I guess.Even now, I mean... I'm 206 days in. I should feel some sort of accomplishment there, some sort of pride of getting this far, but I just don't. Does it even count as an accomplishment if you were struggling the whole way? If your thinking hasn't changed? If *nothing* has changed at all? Does it count? Does it matter?Will I ever feel like it's mattered?
I started cutting 3 years ago. I always do it when I am overwhelmed or panicking, or disappointed and embarrassed about something I did. I like that it gives me something to think about besides my pain. The guy I am seeing has always hated that I do it. I went about a year without doing it but this summer I started back up again. He found out about it and wants me to call him next time instead of cutting, but I'm afraid I won't be able to resist. I literally look forward to it because it feels like it makes my life make sense. Is there a way to make myself see this as wrong? 
I'm having a really hard time right now and I'm not "allowed" to cut, long story, but basically I can't. I really need it right now. I don't know what else to do. I feel so pathetic for even thinking like that, but it feels like I've lost something so significant. It's been a part of my life for so long now, going through one of the absolute worst times in my life, and it was there for me in a very disturbing way I suppose. I only say that because I feel like I have to. I know it's not normal to do, necessarily, but nothing about my life is normal and it gave me something. My heart hurts and I feel like I can't breathe. I just need something to ground me and make me feel like I'm still living.
I'm a 16 year old guy, and I self harm. A lot. I'm not sad at all, I have an okay life and I'm not depressed or anything but it feels like I need to do it. I don't know what's wrong with me. At least twice a week I will cut a part of my body. I don't know why. The other day I got home from hanging out with some friends and grabbed my pocket knife and made a cut on my ribs area. Sometimes I feel like I just need to, not to relieve or give any feeling. And after I do it I do not feel "good" in any way, but that feeling of needing to do it goes away. I only usually cut my thighs or torso. I hate this. I don't know what to do and I want to stop.

I went to the bank today and got helped by a lady. The lady had obvious scars. They could have been from anything but I'm just assuming. I stared. I'm a shit person but that's what I did. I kept looking at them. I was in disbelief that there was actually someone else in the world who did this. I was in disbelief that she had confidence to show them. I was considering asking her but I decided not too and I regret doing so. I probably made her feel like a freak, which was never my intention. I don't get it. I don't get why anyone else would do that to themselves. 
Quick questions.How long does one have to be clean/ do the scars have to be healed over before you can be considered for any kind of scar surgery?What is the best kind of surgery to get for extensive self harm scars on my arms? Is it painful?Thanks for any help!

Background. My girlfriend has been cutting for the past 9-10 months. She's only been my girlfriend for about 2 months now. I started this relationship knowing full well that she cuts sometimes and also knowing that she wants to stop. I've read a lot of websites about self harm and some of them have helped. I would like to hear from people who have helped loved ones stop cutting as to what you found helped your friend/SO/loved one to curb the urges/identify the triggers.I also would like to hear from people who have cut in the past as to what your loved ones/SO/friends have done that you found helped/helps.Any help at all would be so so much appreciated. Seeing her break this is the most important thing in the world to me.
Found a old razor cleaning my room. Been clean for a month and half after i tossed my last blade. Now i can decide if i should toss it or break my streak sigh.
Hey everybody, new account since I forgot my old password and had no email setup, anyway never posted here before so it doesn't really matter.I'm diagnosed with BPD, undergoing heavy depressions and porpably ADD, I've been selfharming for 8 years, I had bad times when I cut and drank daily, and I hd good times when I was clean for months. I'm currently falling in a deep black hole, I was in a DBT-programm which was set for 12 weeks, but after 7 weeks I finally build up the courage to break up with my girlfriend. I wanted to do this for 6 months but when I finally built up the courage the aftermath wrecked me, I drank(4 months clean at the time) and to stop myself from cutting I tried some Promethazine tabletts I had, they didn't help so I tried some more, in the end I had 250mg Promethazine and half a bottle of whiskey, from that time I have absolute memory loss, I woke up 10 hours later in ICU, restrained to the bed, apparently I assaulted a cop who tried to help me since I was outside in the rain, with nothing but shorts while it was raining heavily...I was also eating a newspaper...Once I cleared up, they put me into the closed psych ward and I was expelled(is this the right word? sorry I'm from germany) from the DBT program and had to move back to my parents since I was living with my exgirlfriend and I couldn't take that.What currently worries me:1. I have no clue what to do with my life, I tried university but I just can't do it, way too boring and I have no clue in what kind of direction I wish to go.2. I can't continue living with my parents for much longer, it's super weird but it would be impossible for me to pay for a flat currently.3. Therapy, the clinic i was at was great but I have to wait 3 months before I can get on the waiting list again, which wil be 8-10 weeks atleast, and so far I couldn't find any clinic which offers an extensive DBT programm (I found one which is 5 weeks, really?), which is atleast kind of close to my current place of residence.4. I cut yesterday, I'm just short of submitting to the pressure, tomorrow I'll have a hearing in regards to my assault, I'm scarred what will happen, I've never been in anything similar, I don't have a record and this could seriously fuck with my future, I'm scarred enough, I can't handle the situation and there is much more I'm currently battling.I don't know where I'm going with this, I just needed to let off some steam. I have a really bad urge to cut again, but I can't let me and everyone around me down again.Edit: Thanks everybody for the positive words, I'll do my best.
I self harmed before I know how it once felt to not feel the pain of self harm and the little pain I felt I enjoyed because the feelings inside hurt more. I realized what I was doing dint help at all and now I'm becoming a better person and I know anyone else can. If you ever need to talk to anyone and you feel alone I'm here.  You can contact me here by most active accounts.My text free is (469)444-8983My kik username is UtaTokyoGhoulYou can DM me here im always available.

I've been talking to this girl for about 8 weeks now. We meet on /r/AMIUGLY where I helped her with self -worth issues. Its quite a one-sided friendship(if that's what you can call it) I'm lonely and suffer with depression, so that's maybe why I want to help. I woke up to this(  Haha I'm lying in bed and my bf is all depressed about his results from exams and stuff, and he hates his job, his parents are not understanding. He's blowing everything out of proportion and has even mentioned suicide, which is ridiculous! I know he doesn't mean that! But it makes me sad because I've literally had thoughts of suicide, back when I self harmed. And i told him other people have it a lot worse, his response? "I don't care about others, my life is shit!" Just makes me feel like my past struggles means nothing to him! I'm sorry for ranting! It I just don't know what I'm supposed to do :( if he carries on like this he's going to start me off again! What should I say?  Any help or questions will be greatly received. 
I've been eating a lot of junk lately, drinking sugary drinks, causing me to put on 5 lbs. Eep. And i still don't brush nightly 'cause of "laziness." i've also got to prioritize and be way more productive. I do a whole lot of nothing in my free time, which is why i'm never sure how to answer when asked how my day's going or what i've been up to. I'm grateful that i at least have a job, and a boyfriend who's at least sexually attracted to me. I sleep, walk, overindulge with bad food and sex. This is why i'm afraid that no guy would ever want to stay with me forever. I can't seem to get enough of it together. I lack motivation. Is it OK that I've never been ambitious? I just wanted to get some shit off my chest. Thanks.
I thought I'd make a thread about some things I've found to help with SH and sometimes communicating my feelings about SH too. First of all for those in the UK there's the National Self Harm Network (www.nshn.co.uk) with a forum for people to speak about their feelings, and seek support. I've personally been a member since I was 14. Before you SH try to think, is there ANYONE out there I can speak to about these feelings? Anything I can do to distract me from this urge? If you feel you are really close to self harming please just PM me and I will chat you through it if and when I can, my inbox is always open. If there's someone you can talk to in real life, please ask for help. There's nothing wrong with letting your walls down and asking someone to help you, I learned that lesson too late. If someone threatens to harm themselves, or leave you because you are self harming feel free to point them in the direction of SH resources and support for them. Information that can teach them how to be supportive in a way that actually provides support. Some people mean well but don't understand self harm at all, and that it is an addiction. Never put yourself in an uncomfortable situation trying to assure someone you won't do it again. Personally I refuse to promise anyone that I'm not going to do it again, I've been self harming for 9 years and had the urges for much longer, I'm 23, and will probably self harm again in my lifetime. There's no point making a promise you can't keep, you'll only feel worse down the road. Some people flick rubber bands on their arm to make them feel better, or draw red lines, sometimes I find it therapeutic to draw an arm on a piece of paper and then cut the arm, either by ripping the paper, or drawing red cuts on it and make it look like they're bleeding. When I was a teenager I refused to open up to anyone, but as I got older I realised that I was crippling myself by assuming nobody could be trusted. Give people more credit, they want to help, let them. Seek therapy, counselling, advice. Only good can come of that. Don't be afraid, it's not weakness. You deserve so much better than the addiction SH brings. I can't think of much else but I'll comment this thread with any more things I think of. Stay safe everyone. 
Hey, sorry for a depressing one. I've toyed with the idea before, but I've been pretty stressed all summer. It got kind of bad today and in order to get a bit of a release from that stress I just sort of did it. Before I knew what was happening I had a couple red lines on my wrist. Any advice for dealing with that in the future? In the past I've hit myself and bashed my head on walls and tables and things a lot, but blood always freaked me out. I feel like I've crossed a line now for some reason. 
I've screwed up after almost 3 months. Been in therapy and have honestly tried. I pass off the cigarette burns as bug bites to my kids. Now I'm back to square one but I still believe one day I can beat this. Even though feeling the raised flesh brings me peace I hope one day I can have untarnished skin. So even though I did stumble I will continue to carry on and try to heal.
   Hi guys- I'm v new here, and was wondering what kind of experiences people have had with showing scars in public.    I've been clean for about two months and am super excited about recovery, and have always been pretty open about those issues/ not afraid to talk about it if someone asks (do other people kind of automatically trust others with s/h scars more? is that just me?) BUT now, sadly, the world is ending and every day the US is plunged into a fiery hells cape.    when it's too hot to wear pants/ long sleeves comfortably, would you go without and wear whatever you want, or would you rather stay 'safe' and sweat all day (obviously in professional situations it's a different issue)? If you prefer the former, what is the proper way to respond to people asking what happened or how you got hurt? In my experience, coming straight out with it closes the issue quickly but can also make people uncomfortable or alienate them. beating around the bush can be less uncomfortable in that sense, but is also awkward in its own way, and the questions drag on a bit and tend to draw more attention to the situation.     Is there a method of deflecting well-meaning strangers or acquaintances without a) lying or b) sounding rude or brusque? edit: there are a few other questions like this; I mean specifically when people ask in a way that shows they don't even assume it's self harm (for whatever reason; seems pretty obvious to me).     
Sorry in advance for my languagePeople are just fucking liars and hypocrites. People who claim to want to help people the most watch out for them. They don't give a fuck how you feel. When you reach out for help they are no where to be found. They want you to hurt. They want you to hurt. Its like a notch on their belt or somen. People at the end of the day don't give a fuck. It's better to suffer in silence. Be so silent its like you are not there at all. Be extremely careful and thoughtful before you speak as if your life depends on it (because it might). Please learn from my mistake 
You know how the red marker thing that is suggested, it didn't work for me because it wasn't enough. Yesterday I tried drawing a cut with a pen where I wanted to cut, then painted blood where so it looked like it was bleeding.
Eyes welling up. First-ever time here, getting pretty emotional. Harmed myself a few days ago (self-induced vomiting). Appreciate all this. Sincere thanks to everyone!
So I've only posted here once before about having thoughts of self harming, as well as other borderline self harm behaviors (scratching myself, punching myself, etc). Today I'm supposed to get chicken going on the grill before my parents get home but it wouldn't start. I'm very easily frustrated and post more often to the anger subreddit, and so I quickly gave up and just started burning shit with the lighter; spider webs under the grill and things like that. But when that stopped being satisfying I started seeing how close I could hold the lighter to my own skin. The answer is pretty close, to the point where i'm singeing hairs and leaving mild burn marks. I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, I'm just having a rough time. Thanks guys. 

Last summer, I was at my best, all of my scars had faded to white for the first time in eight years, and although I was afraid and self conscious, I was able to reveal them for a few hours a day while on a foreign holiday with a few close friends.After the holiday things turned to shit and I ended up in a mental health ward in a hospital following a suicide attempt and being a serious danger to myself and others. Long story short, I am mostly clean now, but after seven/eight months, the worst of my scars are still extremely raised and purple in colour. I wish I could wear nice clothes out with my friends and meet new people without worrying about my scars (the most noticeable are on my wrists). My question is:How do/did you guys become comfortable with showing your scars?
Last night I was suicidal. I wanted to cut so badly just end my life. I want deep cuts and blood everywhere. I called a hotline and they talked to me for about 30 minutes and told me to call back if I didn't improve. I called back an hour later and they said I needed to go to the hospital, well they recommended it. I decided to listen to the recommendation and I went to the hospital. They kept me overnight and I talked to a emergency psych person. She talked me down we came up with a safety plan (which I accidently left there). Anyways now I'm painting my dresser as a way to keep myself busy; and right now I feel pretty great! 
Are you after a friendly ear who will listen without judging you? Someone who has been where you are, who you can ask for advice - and if you want, who can find resources in your local area that may be able to help you out?Please do comment or send me a message and let's work out how to get in touch so we can start getting you some help and get you on the road to feeling better. As for me - You can ask anything you like about me here, I'm more than happy to answer anything  publicly - if it's relevant to you it will be relevant to someone else. I'm not a trained psychiatrist/psychologist /counselor etc. Nor do I work for any! I'm a normal guy in Sydney Australia with a lot of personal experience to share, and I just really want to help you out. I'm no miracle cure, I can't fix things - that's your job. But I can listen, and will be here when you're ready to make the necessary changes to get you happy and healthy again.Unfortunately "Sydney" means I'll be sleeping very soon, so until I hear from you, please take care of yourselves. Do your best not to injure until we can talk. It would mean a lot to me. Love, Nick x
Recently found out that my boyfriend cuts himself. He does not wish to go to therapy. He says that he only does it occasionally, when he is feeling very down, but he doesn't seem to have a desire to stop doing it. I am worried that it will lead to something more drastic, like a suicide attempt, but dismisses my concerns. I'm worried, but I don't want to drive him away by insisting he talk to me. Advice on how to handle this from people who have been there? I'm committed to the relationship (we are both around 40, so we are not kids, hence it's not something he is going to "grow out of"). 
Today I had just got off work and I was real thirsty and the dollar store was nearby so I was walking to get some water and then I remembered what dollar tree has.... I found myself walking into the store and going over to that horrible, wonderful place. I was in a trance, suddenly there was a fly on my face and knocked me out of it. I walked around the store completely distressed fighting the urge to go back. When I did eventually lose control and walked back over I had enough sanity left to call a mother figure for help. She talked me down and I went and hung out with her for an hour. She forced water down my throat made sure I'd eaten that day and sent me home, making sure that my best friend would be over until my boyfriend got off work. I am happy and proud that I had such a small victory but at the same time it's like it's painful that I had stopped. Bleh
About a month or so ago I was harming myself and I couldn't stop so I called myself into the ER. They sent me to an outpatient center and they suggested that I drop my psychiatrist and get a new one for various reasons. I had to drop my therapist and take up one of theirs. Anyways, recently the urge to hurt myself has been getting stronger and stronger. I have no found coping methods that work for me (rubber band, red marker, exercising, etc). I promised my family (my friends and boyfriend, I do not include my real family as family) that I would never hurt myself again. I'm really scared for my life right now. If I harm myself again I think I'll lose all my friends who know and my boyfriend because I can't seem to control myself. What methods have worked for you?
So I cut from age 10 to 17. It was an addiction and the only way I knew how to handle extreme feelings since I started so young. When I decided that I needed to stop I found it difficult to stop cold. It was like an itch I couldn't scratch, so while I was learning how to deal with my emotions in a healthy manner I wore rubber bands on my wrist, and when I would get that urge I would snap the rubber band. Eventually I learned how to deal with my emotions in a healthy manner but this was a good middle ground while I was learning.It helped me so I thought I'd share 😊
I don't want to tell people I'm struggling. But I am. I really am.I had a total breakdown last night and hurt myself fairly badly, in a somewhat dangerous place. I even scared myself a little, it bled a lot, but I was still too scared to ask for help. I just got out of hospital after being on a potassium drip due to my ED. They made me feel like I was wasting their time for being there with something self inflicted. I didn't want to be there again. Even though everything in me was screaming at me to call someone, tell my mum I was scared, something.In the end it stopped bleeding badly. My bin looks like a murder scene. It still should probably be looked at. I don't know. I don't want to be told off for wasting time. 
I used to cut but haven't done so in about 6 months. I threw out my razors a few months after fully quitting which has really helped since I know I would have done it again if I still had easy access to them. Unintentionally, I seem to have replaced cutting with bruising.. It just started with hitting and punching my legs when I got really bad. Then I started wanting the pain and the bruises to be worse, so I'd use other things that I'd grab when I freaked out. It's more of an impulsive form of self harm for me, like it isn't really controlled like cutting can sometimes be. I don't really feel like it's something I should stop.. I really don't know, since it's a much more uncommon form of self harm and not many people talk about it. So yeah, it helps me and I don't feel like there's any reason to stop but I was just wondering if there was anyone else who knows anything about this?
I had a silent breakdown today. But I grabbed a sharpie instead of the razor blade. Drew words and cuts instead of actually cutting. It helped to a point.
I'm fine now. I had a big suicidal panic attack and ended up biting my arm (no blood). This broke my eight months clean. He's very pessimistic and knows it isn't his fault but feels guilty. He thinks even though I now don't want to ever hurt myself again, that I will. How can I cheer him up?
Read this from /r/offmychest awhile ago. Hope it helps.
So I've been cutting for a while now, about 10 months now. I've gotten better at resisting but the past few days have been not so successful.  I'm looking into therapy and hope to start by next month. I don't know how much longer I can last without some help but anyways...1)How come when I cut I feel hella better? 2)Am I sick, I mean is something wrong with me mentally that I enjoy doing this to my self? Am I just weak? 3)How come when I cut I don't feel any pain, does anyone have this experience? I mean I feel the sensation of the cut but I don't feel pain, if that clears it up. 4)Is it abnormal that I started cutting so late(not theres a normal time to start)? Im 19 now and I started October 2014 when I was 18. Also is it abnormal that I'm black male that cuts? All I ever see in media or anything is you know that stereotypical image of people who cut. Not that it matters. 5) How come when I use drugs and alcohol my urge to cut is irresistible? 6) Is cutting really that bad? It helps. I couldn't think of anymore questions. Thanks for reading and double thanks for response. 
Sorry I dont know why I'm posting this except I've been feeling really alone lately. My friends are moving away and I missed our last get together so to speak because I was having a bad day and getting out of bed was hard and I just felt so disgusting that being around people felt too hard. I know it's my fault and theyre justifiably pissed but I've been in constant pain since yesterday with a really bad migraine and stomachache and I can't see the doctor till Monday. My parents think I'm just being lazy and i've puked my guts out and can barely keep anything down. It's just too much pain and I can't cope on my own and I don't have any distractions. I feel like cutting really badly but my blades have been taken away and I just feel really reallysick right now. I can't sleep because of the pain and I cant even cry because it aggravates my headache. I can hear my mother calling me crazy from the next room and I just feel really really alone and didn't have anywhere else to go. If you've read all of this, thank you.

So, I'm a writer. And I suffer from depression. I have been tempted to self-harm in the past. But I discovered that I can channel that through my characters. I create characters who self-harm, I find that I'm not tempted. 
As title says, Does therapy actually work? I can't see how it would I feel like my problems are to much and a therapist would never be able to help me. I feel so beyond help. I think I want help my depression and bad thoughts tell me I don't. I am looking into it but if any of you have had success or improvement in quality of life due to therapist please tell me. I'm tired of cutting.
I've tried to quit time and time again and nothing has worked. I got friends to write on my arm, me writing there, pencils, drawing, cold turkey, but nothing worked. I had been cutting for eight years and I knew it was bad but couldn't understand why. Well it got to the point where the action couldn't not be suicidal and that's when I realized I had to stop. I particularly had the help of one friend. Skip the next sentence if you need to. A little backstory, I would take apart pencil sharpeners and use the blades to cut. So by friend, now boyfriend, started a reward system. He'd give me a  mechanical pencil any time I really had to cut and didn't, an an additional pencil every week. The logic was that you don't need pencils sharpeners for a mechanical pencil. The thing is, if I relapsed, I would have to return every single one. So every week I collected my pencils, and on occasion he'd have to come over to calm me down if I was having trouble on my own. And when things got to the point where he could t come over during every panic attack, I would hold each pencil and count to 100. If I did that for each pencil and still wanted to cut, I was allowed to (I never had to cut). He got me a stuffed animal to squeeze as a transition object and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't hard, but this is definitely the best method so far. Now, even if I really want to, I can feel 95% sure that I won't. So I guess this is inspiration for you guys to try something like this; whatever you use, find a way to make it irrelevant in your home. I made pencil sharpeners irrelevant. Collect them, try to have a friend give them to you so the guilt of handing them back holds you to your promise. Please please don't single out one friend though. Use more than one but I learned the hard way it puts a lot of expectation on them. And the best part is that you can still use other methods while using this one like drawing on your arm or whatever. I hope this helps. 
*sigh*I knew I couldn't live without it.
I feel a lot of these posts are people who use cutting as their method for relief, so I feel really alone in what I do. I do my best to harm in a way that no one will notice because the stress of having to explain it to my SO or others would be unbearable. MBasically by using something very sharp like a needle stab or pressing a sharp  serrated knife into my skin, hitting or slapping my thighs(no one questions slight bruises on my legs because I work on my feet), sinking nails into my skin till it almost breaks the skin(sometimes does on accident) and at one point choking. I am in treatment for anxiety and depression and just started back on medication. I only self harm when under emotional distress. Is anyone else like me? 

I'm badly scarred from years of self harm. I've had bad luck finding a relationship recently. Men will approach me and even hook up with me, but when they see the extent of my scarring they say I'm not relationship material. It sucks because this usually comes after dating and having sex, often after me forming some sort of emotional bond. It's not uncommon for them to want to continue having a sexual relationship with me while they look for a "real girlfriend." I don't put up with that anymore, but it's hard to tell when a guy is just using me for sex.I'm kind of giving up now. I still crave companionship and affection, but I can't stand the emotional upset that comes with being used. I've managed to not cut for awhile, but it's gotten really difficult lately because I've become increasingly suicidal. I don't have much hope right now for my future. Have others here gone through this and had a happy ending? I'm trying to find something to look forward to in life.
It's just all coming out of me in such a strong force. I hold in the anger and fear and pain and anxiety and it I wait until I'm going to break then I hurt myself to be able to breathe.Once just causes more, stronger cravings. I want to do it all the time, to feel at peace.Need to bleed more. Don't know if I should tell my therapist or lie and say I fell someplace.. It doesn't look bad, not enough, I need my hand covered in blood. I am not free until it's so.I need more.
Hello there. My name is... We will get to that in a bit. Please give me a chance to explain. My intention, to help others. I am similar to you, I have felt down in the ditches, that I was useless, that there was no point in living. However one day I decided, fuck that shit. Enough was enough, so I decided to help others instead. Which brings me here, I am offering myself to anyone, and I mean anyway. Whether you would like to chat through message, Skype call, Skype video chat or whatever you want. I am offering my full attention to you and your problems. Had a shitty day?, feel like you need to talk to someone? I'm here for you. Also I am a very patient person , and I love to listen to people. If you are interested please pm me, and we can discuss where you would like to talk. Also please note that I might be busy sometimes as I have to constantly move between my mother and my father, and have other duties/ obligations that I have to attend to. Anyway this is completely free of charge, and I am happy to help anyone in anyway possible. ^~^-Thanks *^*
I've been cutting about 11 years. Since I was 13 or so.. I haven't done it in about 4 months.There's a box cutter in the office of my home that is calling to me. I am scared. The secrets and lies and "accidents" to explain a cut to other people. One cut at a time as to not attract suspicion.I have coping skill cards, people to talk to, but I don't want any of that. I want to see my blood grow from inside of my for fresh air.I want to get bad and awful and bleed everywhere.Just one cut, I can tell my housemates it happened at work and my workmates it happened at home. I'm so scared. I don't want to do it slightly, I want to go all out, need stitches. But if I end up in the hospital they'll make me stay for a few weeks. Can't have that, have to function, have to work.Please help me. Please. I am not strong enough to resist it's been far too long with me fighting against it.I don't know what I should do. I'm alone. Want to bleed so badly. I'm Schizophrenic. The voices are gone and I'm alone. I can help them if I cut myself.
I haven't cut since valentine's day. This is the longest I've gone since I started 8 years ago. I've barely even had the urge since I stopped. Until now. When I first started and I really wanted to cut I'd get a tingly feeling on my arm where I usually cut. I haven't had this feeling in years but I've got it right now. I just feel like no matter how hard I try to keep everything together it just keeps falling apart. I'm trying to do better for myself but it feels like I'm right back where I always have been. And the stress and loneliness is just building up and cutting is the only way I know how to deal with feeling this pit in my chest. I'd like to start therapy or try antidepressants but I just started a new job and don't have insurance yet. I don't even know who to talk to. I'm 20 years old and I feel like everyone around me thinks that self harm is just something dumb teenagers do. My mom is the only person who I can ever talk to about it but she's got so much going on right now I just can't add this to her stress.
I was eating at a restaurant with my family. Nothing was wrong but I wanted to cut when I was there. I wanted to just get a knife and go in the mens room and cut. I'm really considering bringing razors with me now. I think I'm sick. I want to quit. I've tried and only made it to 11 days. I'm pathetic. I shouldn't want to cut. How do I quit? Will I ever want to stop?
I apologize if this is out of bounds, but it's something I have struggled with for a very long time.My history with self-harm goes back 11-12 years (currently 24).  When speaking to a counselor about it, I realized I started self-harming as a sort of defense mechanism against another psychological bully in my life: panic attacks.  The easiest way for me to describe it, to this day, is that I start to feel "too far away" and I need something to "bring me back."I realize there are many reasons for self-harm.  Personally, for me it is a sort of shock therapy.  I have too much anxiety sometimes and I start losing my grip on reality, slipping into panic.  Sometimes I respond by self-harming.  Without getting too graphic... seeing what I've done forces me to snap back to the current place/time, and deal with what's in front of me.  There always comes a point when I take a few deep breaths, my mental state returns to normal, and I proceed to care for any wounds, etc.  After that, I can usually eat like normal, and fall asleep (things I would have been struggling with hours earlier).Does anyone else experience this?  Obviously, I know self-harm is not heathy, and I should not do it.  But specifically, are there others out there who do this awful thing because it seems to help them cope with something even more awful?  Perhaps even *prevent* that awful something?  What does this mean?  It seems that it really does help sometimes, and I have trouble deciding I'd rather take the mental anguish than the physical consequence.Again, I am sorry if this is inappopriate or too graphic.  I've rarely spoken about it before, and I'm just wondering if anyone else has the same experience as me. 
As the title says i need help and i don't know where else to post this. I'm slowly losing my mind. I should probably start at the beginning though. So I'm a member of the military and I want to die. I haven't even done anything though i just lost the will to live i guess. I want to cut but i cant because someone would immediately notice... I want out but i know if i leave ill be just as screwed if not worse yet i cant take it here anymore. I want to tell someone or go to one of the services offered. but im afraid i'll be put on suicide watch and stuck here for even longer. Im also afraid of whatll happen if i actually do ask for help. I've resorted to eating and drinking as little as possible hoping that something will happen. I'm sorry for this rant i just needed to tell someone.
Aside from my husband not liking it, why should I stop self harming? I really need a good reason to motivate myself. 
In the metal music underground you'll come across a number of bands with members who will go out of their way to nearly bleed to death onstage or in the studio.Generally, these people cut themselves either to help create a very dark, depressive atmosphere (ex: Niklas Kvarforth, Shining [Sweden]) or just to try to replicate the "energy" that other cutters have had (ex: Maniac, Mayhem [Norway]).These bands are almost always interested in creating the darkest music possible, or, sometimes, the most emotional. Some have gone so far as to try to make listeners want to kill themselves, however they have done nothing but admit to producing "cathartic shit." Personally, I feel such bands are akin to Alice Cooper in how they present themselves (Cooper's stage show being completely harmless when chickens are not involved), and that their music is not only cathartic but also more "true," unlike the uninteresting, emotionless, over-produced, commercial pop, rap, and metalcore/deathcore of today.  However many don't feel the same as I. Redditors, what are your thoughts on this theatrical variant of self mutilation? 
Last night I relapsed, and it's gonna happen again. Should I try to stop myself, even though I'll fail, or should I just give in to it and let myself cut all I want? Is one worse than the other?

I guess I just want to see if anyone else had self harm end a relationship, or if you had a SO use it against you or throw it in your face, because this happened to me recently.I've had depression and anxiety issues in the past, and recently got out of a decade long relationship. One night a few weeks ago, after a particularly bad fight, he brought up an incident where he had to take me to the hospital 5 years ago because I had cut my wrist. I won't go into the gory details, but it involved alcohol and was mainly an isolated incident. I still have the scars, and feel shame, but for the most part I put it behind me. He said his feelings changed for me after that and he never felt the same "after all that craziness". Is it just me, or was that really mean and insensitive to throw it in my face like that? I guess I just wanted to tell this story because I don't have anyone else in real life who I would dare tell this to. Anyone else go through something like this? How did you cope? I want to move forward and forget, but it's making me so angry.
I recently got a promotion at work and I will now be running groups on the adolescent unit (ages 13 -18) at a psychiatric hospital, and I'm trying to come up with some new ideas. The groups I run need to be therapeutic, but can't have the kids doing too much processing. For those of you who have participated in group therapy at some point, was there ever any particular activity/handout/topic that you found helpful? Could you explain? Was there something that made group more fun like icebreakers, or music? Perhaps being outside? I'd appreciate as much input as possible. Thanks!
My life has been fucking stressful from hell since Monday and I'm close to my limit. Just started the process of getting disability, have to adjust to a new diagnosis, and me and my girlfriend just had the biggest fight of the relationship.
Today, while taking a shower, I discovered fresh(no more than a day old) scars on my stomach that were obviously self- inflicted. I threw out all my blades but I found a kitchen knife in my room. The last week has been kind of a blur, but is this normal? To not remember cutting yourself?
So let me preface this by saying that I don't self harm, not really anyways. I've done things like, pinch myself, scratch my arms, and there was a time when I carried rubber bands and hair ties in my pockets and would snap myself with them whenever I was having any kind of unwanted thoughts or feelings, not just to snap out of it; I would do it as a punishment, multiple times until it "hurt enough." I really have no idea how to cope with emotions, they're strange to me and they don't make any sense. I handle physical pain much better so there have been times I've thought that the solution is to transfer emotional pain into physical pain and cope with it that way. I know that this is a bad idea and that it would very likely escalate into more and more destructive behaviors so I'm doing everything I can to avoid it. That's why I'm posting here. Thanks for listening guys, thoughts and advice are welcome.
I'm afraid that after this cigarette I'm going to go back inside and hurt myself again. My girlfriend broke up with me about 2 weeks ago, and immediately afterwards I was extremely emotional. Now, I don't feel any better, but I can feel myself becoming numb. I'm afraid that I will start bottling everything up, and lose my friends and start to feel extremely alone like I did in high school. There's no one I can talk to about this because my therapist can't see me for another week. I don't know what to do, and I feel like things are just getting worse because I'm so fucked in the head.
I have fresh ones from two nights ago, they are on my upper thigh and there is about sixteen or so. I used a padded bandage thing that sticks on to hide it from view, but the problem is my partner will ask what it's about and force it off to see what's behind it. I don't want him knowing I relapsed, and I am fully prepared to tell my doctor but I don't want him to know. I've used not wanting sex as a way of avoiding it, but we always sleep nude and I don't want to risk an awful situation happening.I tried using foundation to cover the redness but it's still noticeable and doesn't make it any better. Is there an actual way to make fresh scars FAR less noticable/visible?
I'm seeing him on the 17th and I'm afraid he wont give me guidance on what to do, he never says or does much. I harmed an area of my body very badly, but he doesn't seem to understand the severity because I guess he thinks of cutting as shallow, light cutting as the only way of cutting. I go crazy and really harm myself, I don't know what to do or where to seek help. Should I be seeing a psychologist instead? because I also suffer from disassociation and personality issues.
So I relapsed a couple days ago and cut on my thighs. I was wearing shorts, and my friend saw the cuts and got really upset. I just don't understand why their reaction would be like that. Maybe it's because I've done it for 9 years, but it just seems like a few cuts to me. Can you help me see her POV?
.... of being clean, I relapsed... I didn't cut nearly as deep as I used to though... and the sick part, is that I'm disappointed in myself, because the cuts weren't deep like they used to be... I'm so confused... I just want to be happy...
This is an alt account, for obvious reasons.I have been clean from cutting since December 12th, 2014. Last night, I broke down crying after a particularly stressful week that included an email from my boss with "concerns," my laptop's hard drive failing, and being down and alone in general. I came so close to finding something sharp and letting out my frustrations and sadness, but I didn't. Instead, I took a red marker and marked where I would normally cut on my wrist. Something about seeing that helped. I washed off the ink, listened to some soft music, and fell asleep. I woke up this morning feeling so damn proud knowing that I continued my clean streak. Almost 7 months clean, and I can't wait to add more months to that. [There ARE alternatives to cutting!](http://www.adolescentselfinjuryfoundation.com/page11) <- I typically use this website when I feel an urge. Cutting is an addiction, and a hard one at that. It's difficult to stop and even more difficult to keep going, but it's so worth it in the end.

But I have no one. Literally no one.
I love video games and I've been playing lots of Destiny. But PvP can get very frustrating and sometimes I'll hit myself. Mostly punching or slamming my fist into my thigh and knee. Last night was a pretty intense gaming session and I got really worked up. I was really close to winning a long streak of matches (I was 8-0 in Trials of Osiris if anyone knows what that is). My team lost and I couldn't handle it. If I'm alone in the house I often yell and curse but it was late so I let my anger out on my leg since I wouldn't wake anyone up. I've always been pretty easily angered by video games, multiplayer specifically. It's just that now I'm looking at this gross bruise on my leg and feel like I really need to change things. It's embarrassing to admit but despite me knowing it's stupid and pointless to get so angry and hurt myself over a virtual game, I feel good letting my anger out like that. I've occasionally tried breathing exercises but I sometimes feel that I want to stay angry. Like I'm frustrated by the game not going my way, but simply calming down and relaxing makes me feel sort of hollow. I feel like if I tried playing in a totally laid back way where I didn't care about the outcome of the game would make me play worse since I'm not giving it my all. But when I try my best and still fail I feel frustrated and hit myself  I don't want to quit video games but I'd like some tips especially from those who've dealt with anger due to video games on how I can deal with losing without hurting myself. 
So about 4 months ago I had a relapse with SI, and things have been getting better since then. But today I found out that my GF told at least 4 of her friends about the episode, and now I'm freaking out... should I be concerned? I just feel extremely anxious about this information being at there... what should I do

First, apologies for format. I'm on mobile and I also seldom post. Apologies again for any offensive, triggering, or any way inappropriate terminology coming your way; I'm unfamiliar with mental illness and self harm.But thanks for those who read.TL;DR: My BF and I are visiting my older, bipolar, sister and staying with her for another day and a half. I just overheard her fiance yell at  her for cutting herself. Is there anything I can/should do (to help her, help her get help, in general...)?______________________I'll try to keep this short. I just really need some advice and feedback...My older sister suffers from bipolar disorder. I'm not sure what type. She was diagnosed about 3 or 4 years ago. Unfortunately according to her, she has yet to find a treatment that effectively lets her live an emotionally stable life. And right now, I'd say she's been in a depressive state for a while.We're not terribly close, and never have been due to issues growing up. When she left home for college I feel like she never came back. It's been nearly ten years since I've really lived with her.My boyfriend ("Jon") and I ("Annie") have been staying with her ("Mary") and her fiance ("Nath") for the past nearly two weeks. Jon and I fly to our home cost on Tue morning. Today, "Trucy" came to visit for the next few days as well. Nath and Mary gave their bed to Trucy and are camping out in the living room until Jon and I leave. Tonight everyone turned in very early, but Jon and I stayed up to watch TV. About thirty minutes ago, we heard:A muffled argument between Nath and Mary; Mary eventually cried out "leave me alone"; Nath at one point saying " Mary, you can't just cut yourself! What you're doing is wrong!" a number of times; the commotion of Nath getting presumably band aids or bandages.I had no idea her  low was this low. I don't know how long she's been doing this, or how long or if her fiance knew. I knew she was bipolar, that she recently finished some sort of therapy program... But not this.Reddit, what is a little sister  supposed to do?
So I am currently in my second year of university. The last time I self harmed was last September, and before last year on and off all through highschool (5 years).I am worried I will do it again, as I go through cycles kind of. I feel positive for a few weeks, and then I just feel terrible, and feel an indescribable emptiness for a while. This is when I used to do it, but I've been trying to feel my feelings if that makes sense.It's just getting too hard though, and I suspect my body is reacting physically to what I am feeling, as I have been checked out and ok'd physically but problems are persisting.I don't want to go back to that and don't know what to do.

Desperately want to cut. What do I do? I just keep imagining doing it.
**you need to know**Many people have a hard time understanding or even talking about self-injury because it seems so unnatural to them. Understanding why pain can feel good can help people understand why you self-injure.While most people think of pain as a bad thing and something to avoid, everyone has had some experience with pain feeling good. Here are some examples of pain that can feel good:* firmly massaging an aching muscle* scratching an itch* diving into a cold lake or pool on a 95-degree day* taking a whirlpool bath in hot water* vomiting when you are nauseated* popping a pimple* exercising even though your muscles burnSome scientists believe that a sudden pain, as opposed to a prolonged ache, releases endorphins, a biochemical that produces a kind of high in the brain. This is one explanation of why self-injury may be addictive for some people.There are also psychological reasons why pain might feel good. * I hurt myself because it is the one thing in my life I can control.* I hurt myself because it keeps me from feeling numb and dead inside.* I hurt myself because it is better than thinking about all the bad memories I have.* I hurt myself because I deserve to be punished.* I hurt myself because it's exactly the kind of thing that would upset my parents the most.* I hurt myself because it makes me feel things that I can't put into words.
I don't care about the 25 kls that I’ve gained. I don't care about been dumped for being fat and self-hating. I only care about this feeling of emptiness, and the mood boosting that food gives me. Please help me to think about other things. I don't want to begin eating and never control myself again.
I've managed to mostly stop cutting for the past couple years, barring a couple incidents. It's a vast improvement from harming every day. My method for stopping was some counselling but. mostly avoidance. Any SH or suicide atttempts have been relatively impulsive. To avoid that I remove the xactos I needed to do so from our house, and that helps. When we not infrequently need to use it for renos we buy new ones and throw them away after.. If they are in the house when Im very low, I do my best to remove myself from any location with those tools. Even leaving the house. And avoiding any stores that sell them.I cant remove myself or the other method. Nor can I remove the method from my reach. Its like the difference between an addiction where you can avoid touching it like alcohol and something like an ED where you have to deal with the object every day for the rest of your life. Is russian roulette considered self harm? This operates a similar wayI dont get the same rush or relief from stopping my meds as I did from deep cutting so it shouldnt be tempting. I dont even understand why it is so  appealing.I was feeling vaguely like not wanting to live before it but as soon as I realized I could irrepairably damage myself by not taking the meds I havent been able to get harming that way out of my head. This constant thought of it never leaves the same as the cutting does when Im in a bad way. Except its almost all of the time now. This doesnt feel like the desperation of wanting and trying suicide I had before. Its the slow burn obsession of chronic self harm but I cant bring myself to care that it could and will kill me either in a day or up to a few weeks.I feel like if I understood this better I could find a reason or strategy to stop wanting this. I dont get a rush from it or relief like I did from cutting. All it does is perversely satisfy that deep and ugly urge to damage, scar or otherwise maim myself. Along with the allure of knowing that if I die from it its more like chance and Id feel less culpable doing so than the more violent and direct way I tried before.I wish I had the money to see my therapist right now. But weve been eating rice and ramen and frozen peas for the past two months bc this medication is EXPENSIVE AS SHIT. Each day I dont take it I save a few dollars. Im  also a bit worried about not having control over the whole proccess. I didnt take my pill tonight and its not medically serious at one day not taken but I feel the pain taking away some of my ability to process things. Maybe just my ability to care or be scared. Maybe thats not the pain and its just depression causing it. I dont know. I dont know what to do. It just seems so wonderfully easy to sit back and let fate decide this roulette.
I'm not really sure if this is appropriate for this sub, but I can't really think of a better place for it. This pathetic post is nothing more than a coping method that I'm trying out instead of doing something I'll regret later, so feel free to disregard.I graduated college in May, lost my job a few days before graduation for missing a few days (had a concussion, couldn't come into work for a few days), and I've been on a self-destructive spiral ever since. I've had a habit of turning to excessive alcohol and drugs when times get tough, but it's never been as consistent and excessive as this. I would have a bad day or an unproductive day, get super anxious about it all, and get into this trance, for lack of a better word. I wouldn't turn to anyone for help or distraction; I would be very deliberate about the half a bottle of whiskey that I would down, chew my fingernails until they bleed, or convince myself that I would be better off dead. I'm scared of talking about it to my girlfriend cause I don't want to drive her away, my parents would certainly never understand, and I don't want to burden my younger brother with any of this. So I just keep it to myself and keep on doing what I do. On my better days, I tried to watch some motivation videos on youtube, read articles about self harm and self respect and all that stuff and it really does help. Unfortunately, when I get into these moods, all logic, reason, and common sense goes right out the window.This slump is ruining my life and it seems to get more and more difficult with every passing day to even think about getting out of it
Over the past few months I've started cutting, in what I thought was a comping mechanism for the depression I was feeling. As such I haven't cut in the past few weeks since I started taking an antidepressant. But yesterday I got the idea to take apart a razor and use the blade to more efficiently cut. I struggled with the idea for a few hours but eventually relented and started cutting again...but once I made a particularly deep cut, a new feeling started to arise when I felt the blade go deep into my skin and bleed pretty badly...I can only describe the feeling as a manic euphoria which lasts for at least a few minutes after I make a deep cut which bleeds enough to start flowing down my arm.This feeling scares me because it's making me want to cut more than ever before, but I know I shouldn't, plus the deep wounds and blood lose will catch up to me, so can anyone tell me if this manic euphoria is normal? at least to some degree? Or is it some precursor/indicator to something more dangerous than just cutting? 
I have scars on my left arm from when I had SH issues around a year ago. They are white now but still noticeable as the cuts were quite deep. On some occasions, people have pointed them out to me around other people and i never know what to do. For example, i was at a dinner with my boyfriend, boss and her daughter. I was sitting next to her daughter who was around 12, who saw them and pointed "what happened?" I don't think she understood what it was and luckily no one heard and i kinda just said "nothing" and quickly started a conversation with her mum. Im worried that one day everyone will hear, or this situation will come up again, what do I say? how do i avoid this?
I'll start off with I have an appointment with a general doctor on the 10th of July. I have to have one of those to get a referral to anyone else in my area.  I'm scared I'm not going to make it. I have struggled with hurting myself (biting, scratching) since I was in middle school, I'm 32 now. For awhile it gets better then it gets really bad; it has never been this bad before. Usually right before I hurt myself i have a couple seconds of am I going to do this, sometimes I can push it away. Usually I do anyways. On Tuesday last week I just did. No thought involved. Friday same thing. I'm getting scared that I'm going to do something worse than leave 6 inch scars down my arms. My best friend made the appointment for me, asked me if I would rather go to the hospital instead. I feel I should have said yes. I've never talked to anyone about this. my friend is the first, and that's only because he saw my freshly scratched arm. I don't know how to tell a doctor what I'm going through. I know I'm not the only person with this I mean there's a sub right?How do you tell a doctor that is why you are seeing them?
Hey guys,Hope you all are well. For the past 10 months I've been making a serious effort not to self-harm after going to residential treatment and really exploring the roots of some of my issues. I've found that the urges have decreased significantly in both frequency and intensity. However, every now and then an urge does hit me. I have a comfort box that I use and a lot of distraction techniques that I engage in. Recently I found out about a site called Urge Zapper from another subreddit. It's nothing magical, but it does help you walk through the steps to wait out the urge at a time when you might not be able to think rationally and use all of the skills you've been taught (or at least that's how I feel from my experience). Anyway, I just used it for the first time and found it to be really effective. So check it out! (FYI I'm not associated with it in anyway!)[Urge Zapper](http://www.urgezapper.com)Take care<3
Hello /r/StopSelfHarm, As the title states I have a friend, 19F, who has a cutting problem. She has some noticeable scars and admitted it one night when we were drinking (I don't believe she remembers it, or at least isn't willing to acknowledge it). It kills me to see her in that kind of pain, and I honestly don't know what/why she does feel the way she does. So how do I confront her? I don't want her to feel threatened by my actions or the like, but I can't sit around and ignore it either. It'd be a 1-1 session. Maybe over coffee or something? I mean I have some ideas on what I could do; but it seems like I'm only going to have one chance to get through to her and make it count.What should I say? What should I do? And what shouldn't I say, and what shouldn't I do?
I haven't self-injured in the last 12 months and I wanted to share what I have been doing to live "clean." I've been breaking things other than myself. I had a bunch of stuff left over from an old relationshit, and when I was crying in bed about it I just wanted to inflict pain on myself so much. I thought about the box of stuff and I was like Why do i still have that garbage. I took out scissors and a hammer and smashed everything into tiny pieces. It was exhilarating. Afterwards I felt amazing and I only nicked my thumb on the scissors by accident, everything else was busted up because i got my anger out. Now I want to take boxing, and I think this is a great way to get out rage.

Hello, everyone. I have a friend over Skype who admitted to me that she self-harmed to cope with her relationship with her mother. She is fourteen and lives in Ontario.I promised her I would put together a list of resources that she could check out. She's not in a position where she can ask for help from the law, but at the very least I can help her find ways to start helping herself.If you have any advice to pass on to her, I would love to hear it. It could be websites to visit, numbers to call, or practical advice such as using ice and rubber bands. It could even just be words of encouragement.
I am working with a DBT therapist and attending group once a week. I am battling eating disorder behaviors, self harm urges and other self destructive habits. I understand and agree that I can work from the inside and hopefully my behaviors will settle.I am wondering, for those in 'recovery' - do you ever find anything that gives you the same relief? I want to stay clean. I want to resist and be healthy and overcome this. I have tried running (which has been hard to balance the exercise addiction from the eating disorder with a 'healthy' lifestyle) for the "running high". I am trying mindful practice daily (when possible) to assist with the relief of being able to "breathe" - which is how i've described SH to my therapist. I feel like I can resist the temptation, but that I'm white knuckling through.I hear many people in the ED world say that the thoughts always linger, they quiet, but they linger (fuck me, right?). Just wondering for those who have overcome SH, does that gnawing, crawling out of your skin, anxiety induced monster leave? Did you find something healthy that gives you the same thing?I WANT TO BE BETTER. But. I also want to **feel** better.
My mom has been extremely depressed the last few weeks and is taking medicine for it. a few weekends ago she got really drunk and came back home where my step dad and brother had to drive her to the hospital. She was drinking a lot over the last few months and later the week she was taken to the hospital I found out it was because she overdosed. I read somewhere that one way is to make her feel better but I don't know how.I think my mom is cutting herself because she told me to go to my room today because she had to talk to my stepdad and she was upset. when I later walked out of my room my stepdad wasn't talking and my mom looked like she had cried. I know it sounds like a they had a fight but I have heard them fight before so I know it wasn't a fight. The main reason I think she is cutting herself is because when I was throwing something into the bathroom garbage I found a razor that had the top open and with no blades. I saw one blade in the garbage but I didn't see the other two.I can't come out right and ask her if she is because I know she will deny it even if she is. I am really scared that something might happen to her, I'm scared I am going to lose her and f she really is I want to help her somehow. Is there any signs to look out for to see if she is actually cutting herself? And if she is, is there anything I can do to help her?
I'd met this girl twice. I am/was into her. She called me and told me it wasn't working out. I want to cut myself to shreds
I haven't cut/burned in almost 5 years. I am incredibly mad at myself and frustrated at everything in general, I can't shake the urge to harm. I'm currently with my boyfriend at his house. He doesn't know about my harming past because it stopped shortly after we started dating. Maybe him being here will prevent me from doing anything, but I want to so badly. We're supposed to be drinking with friends later, which means I likely just get really really drunk instead...Today sucks :(
For me, listening to Sia's songs Chandelier, Elastic Heart, Big Girls Cry and Fire Meet Gasoline are triggers for me, for some reason.

I want to stop but I need motivation. My gf was this motivation and she kept me from sh for a month. Our relationship fell apart last week, and now I'm back to the old ways. I just need something or someone to make me stop. Please. 
i've been clean of SH since january 31st of 2014, so about a year and a half without hurting myself. even with that, of course i still struggle with urges and intrusive thoughts sometimes. those times can include whenever i have a tool that i would have used previously. i recently found the subreddit /r/ladyshavers and i thought it would be neat to try it out, but when i ordered a kit, i was kind of worried about having to put the blade into the razor. today i got the kit. i actually put a blade in without having any urges! it's small but i'm honestly really happy. i feel like i've come so far.
In March 2014, I took a semester off school to get help and I stopped cutting. I've been doing fine, with a little more anxiety creeping in the past few weeks.I'm at my university now, making up my skipped semester, and I lost my student ID today. I don't know why, but this is making me lose it. I can't stop telling myself how stupid I am for doing something like that. I've cried and I've been hitting myself (I know, technically SH), but I just want to cut now.  I'm so fucking mad at myself. I've had a good week, but this has completely ruined everything
**Felt anxious and episodically unstable for last 1.5 years. No trigger self harmed with burns. afraid of infections, feel confused. Tired. Not suicidal**I'm not sure if this the place for this but i think i need to reflect a little.I'm male, 22 and live on my own. My whole social network consists of under 10 people family included and few i don't even want to talk to.My life situation is relatively stable but my mind has been going this rollercoaster for the last 1.5 years. Mostly anxiety/depression/hypomania/mindweirdness style things but i don't know because i only seem to realise how things shift in my head in retrospect and i don't really digest it well so i don't think about it and hide it both world and myself. Currently i feel kinda fine i guess. Like always. But i think i don't really see all the signs when i feel weird and so that doesn't matter.Some years ago i promised to myself that i won't self harm because it leaves too much visible cues for others and that i would straight suicide rather than scar myself for absolutely no gain.My thoughts have been pretty dark and weird lately and as always there come self harm thoughts. On one hand i feel absolutely disconnected from them but still i feel compelled and drawn to them. For a while my brain had suggested that i burn myself with something.At first i tried needle and lighter...Afterwards i felt like the wound wasn't "enough".So i went overboard. I would burn myself three times a session with a screwdriver over the last week to the current 22 burns.It felt like i needed to do damage so they are 2.5-5cm large so whole of my left forearm. Mostly 2nd and a little of 3rd degree damage in the mittle of the wound.I don't consider myself suicidal but i'm really worried about the infection risk in them that i don't see it coming and it will be too late and i'll drop dead.I feel fine but i don't know what my definition of fine is. I don't even feel the anxiety anymore even though it drives my behaviour to the core. Through the rollercoaster i've felt "fine".I can keep my social facade up for almost forever. I just don't know how to feel about my situation, myself, thoughts, behaviour, situation, and emotionally.I'm just kind of tired after the last "good" episode. Nobody can help me here but i think i want someone somewhere to read this and tell me what to do.
I just discovered this subreddit and felt compelled to write. I'm turning 25 soon, and I first started cutting myself when I was around 13. Thinking back, the world felt very different. I felt so separate from the big picture. I felt so separate from adults. I felt so separate from all the things that run the world.I guess I just want to give my own advice to those who self-harm, especially the young teens.1. **Growing up changes you entirely**. As a teenager I just felt like a nobody, who was extremely shy, kept messing up and couldn't really imagine a grown-up world for myself. Later, I somehow ended up taking charge, paying my own tuition & bills, moving to the big city, getting a sweet full-time job and being completely independent. To put it simply, life is good. I was a disaster, and I've evolved. You can too.2. **Scars are forever.** Think about the big picture. Scars stay with you forever. When you mark up your body at the age of 13, it's there until you're 80. **I have had an extremely hard time accepting my scars, and of course I regret them.** My *feelings* weren't worth it. My body never deserved it. I hate that I now want to be a sucessful, happy, youthful & attractive young woman, and yet I get hesitant to take my clothes off for a boy because they'll see a side of me which doesn't really exist anymore, but I can't shake off. Ugh. *Now I can't tell what's worse: the feelings that compelled me to self-harm, or the feelings I get when I have to explain to a new man in my life about my past.* If you're reading this, I hope you reconsider your next few scars. It's hard, but it's all about baby steps.3. **Become your own best friend.** This has helped me through the years. Get to know yourself. Talk to yourself if you have to, even if it's in your mind. What's overwhelming you? Instead of swimming in feelings, what else can you do to improve your situation? How do you redeem yourself when you've messed up? What baby steps can you take today, to help you achieve your big goals? Learn how to comfort yourself instead of depending on other people. 4. **Read up on philosophy, psychology, evolutionary psychology, & more.** This may sound weird, but all of these things help you understand humans, as well as snap back into reality. It can be really hard to remind yourself that, *hey, you're just a tiny speck on a tiny planet, with one tiny short life to live... you can go have a lot of fun with that, so do it!*.I could write a lot more, but I'll just leave it at this for now.If I could speak to my 13-year-old self now, I'd really just say *"Hey. I know you feel ugly, worthless, and alone right now, but when you're older, being different will end up being a really GOOD thing. I promise. And maybe no boys think you're pretty right now, but when you're older they will - especially because you're different from all those basic girls. :) Make your negative feelings drive you to do better & achieve more! Love you. "*
It's been almost a month since I last hurt myself. I've been doing alot better at trying to change the voices in my head. I have been working real hard on my issues and was a making real progress. Today when I woke up for work I felt completely wrecked and alone. Why I have no idea but I wanted so bad to fold up into myself and cry. I was so tempted to cut or burn myself but I didn't. How I wanted to and still do but I know it's not the answer. I have to let myself feel these things and learn to work through it. I'm trying so hard to get better but tonight I just want sleep and not wake up. If I get through the night I pray tomorrow will be a better day.
 I started cutting myself when I was 11, at 16 I stopped because I was really tired of it, I really wanted to move on. I made a promise to myself that I will try my hardest to never harm myself again. Last year I was in a lot of stress and I scratched my leg.. I didn't make it bleed but I felt really bad after... I been at the edge of cutting my arm again. I try really hard not to do it. I haven't but I know that someday I might do it again. I'm scared. I don't want to go back to that place. this is the most long period of time that I haven't cut. I feel proud of it. I know that I'm not cured, that is an addiction. But I'm doing my bestI just wanted to share this, my close friends know about my struggles but I don't really like to talk about it. that's why I'm sharing this here. 
I just thought of this yesterday, but wouldn't it be good, for patients who can't 'just stop' as many doctors have told me, to promote not better ways but safer ways to self harm. Or to tell patients how to safely care for their wounds? I'm an alcoholic and am getting help on how to reduce my drinking safely and to overall reduce the risk of drinking, but for cutting I have basically just been told to try stop on my own? Would it not be better to tell patients ways they can reduce the harm they are doing (reducing infection, scaring, etc) if they are in the position where self harm is a sort of addiction? Just a thought. Any opinions or experiences? TW: MORE DETAIL! (I used to use like a really dirty knife to self harm and it was gross, I had no idea how to care for and clean wounds and they would just get weird and infected or just heal badly. I just feel maybe like needle exchanges or reduced harm drinking, there should be a way people treat self harm that includes the addictive side.)
Sorry for the placeholder, but honestly i didn't know what the specific subject should be about.I mean, i'd like to come clean that we're all reasonable adults and can cope with the help of one another. Been reading the threads and you're a great community, however my reason for posting here today isn't for congratulating the community (unfortunately)It's simply to ask for ways to **prevent** your addicting from taking over. A small background is as follows:> I'm 22 this year (~a month from now), i have a somewhat stable life. I work a part time job with a business sign company and don't study at the moment (will in the fall), that said, my relationship with family is perfect at the moment. (A few cracks here in there, mainly disagreements, but nothing extreme.) and one would claim things are pretty damn squeaky clean.However, occasionally I get these sudden urges to cut myself on my left wrist (*there's something about it that just causes me to want to cut there.*) *When i was smaller, my mom brother would provoke my mom and she'd throw things. Sometimes they'd hit me in the face or eye my accident. I doubt that might be the cause.*> Although I'm not proud to disclose this, i believe I *might* have some sort of *drug addiction*. I get my medication by following the legal channels (i.e. Psychiatrist and doctor.) My mom and brother know about this and they tell me to stop taking the medications they prescribe me, because i can't seem to. I fondly believe one of the medications i take will give me what i'm looking for (Small backstory: I follow /r/schizophrenia and other mental health sub-reddits mainly to read posts and subjects about schizophrenia - *i secretly desire to be.*) i do go to AA meetings at my local church and attend some weekly programs they offer, but they make me feel empty and don't necessarily make much of a difference.Wow. just re-reading my above paragraph makes me sound nuts. (*Probably am.*)> About a week ago, my boss had everyone preparing for a church fair and we were to sell stickers so we can raise funds for the church and promote our business, during that time, my boss had me cutting stickers with a blade. Something about doing that made me feel two things: 1. Disappointed i couldn't cut the stickers properly (Small backstory: Ever since i was small i developed memory issues, it's not an official diagnosis -- My brain scans come out fine. An example would be when i was debating with my shrink yesterday about my pills not lasting a full thirty days and unable to remember what day i ran out or time i saw her last. We debated about this for a bit, but i honestly *couldn't remember*) and because i couldn't cut properly, i was mad at myself because i couldn't focus all that week. 2. Something about wielding the razor from work and using the [paper trimmer] (http://www.uline.com/images/product/Large/H_2516_L.jpg), made me want to cut myself. I would touch those things sometimes (especially the [trimmer] (http://www.uline.com/images/product/Large/H_2516_L.jpg) and apply as much pressure as i could on my left wrist and hope something would happen. *Boss would notice before anything serious happens and warn me to not play with it, and also put the blade away when i was done using it.*When the time for the fair came, we were all ready and i were to dress up as a [dragon] (https://igcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t51.2885-15/11380229_488303501324690_889388041_n.jpg) for the kids and hand them a balloon. **For the most part, i behaved well and whatever i was feeling previously i did my best to hide whatever urge i had. Especially because i didn't want to lose my job or scare the kids. But i was carrying a blade with me.**> Fast forward to now, I really don't know what to do anymore in regards to my urges. Everytime i touch a blade, something about it triggers the need for me harm myself. I've kind of mentioned what's been happening to my psychologist and psychiatrist but they make it seem like a medication problem (**Note: I've been having these urges since after i was 13 and kind of had this bullying problem and suffice to say, it results in me succumbing to rape from a neighbor of mine for two years.**) honestly i'm sick of having these problems.Thanks for having the time to read this unorganized series of events and backstory about myself, but i'm at my wits end and i don't know what to do anymore. I hate worrying family, and two years ago i had a big fight with my dad's side of the family that pretty much pegged me as some 'psycho' and that title doesn't leave me. :/
I don't know why the hell I started so I don't know how to stop. I'M A FUCKING ADULT. I've watched so many friends hurt themselves before. I know better. 
I have some marks on my upper arm, both new and old.  My one friend said I had a cut on my arm, jokingly she pulled up my sleeve and revealed my marked up arm to the whole group.  I can tell they were a little shocked and caught off guard and I tried to play it off as work injuries. (I do a lot of work around metal and other sharp objects) So I have no clue what to do now since so many people saw them.

Just in case some of you don’t know it my inbox is always open. I know i’ve talked to a lot of you on here before and im sure there are many more that lurk and never post. If your having a bad day, need a sounding board or aren’t sure what to do next please feel free to send me a message. 
I want to cut. I have razors in my nightstand. I want to bleed and hurt and cry. Because it's better than the screaming inside my head, telling me "You're worthless, unloved, forgotten, kill yourself." I know I won't. I made a promise not to. I'm too afraid to. But it's like it's banging inside my head, screaming at me. Cutting makes it a little quieter. A little easier to handle. It chases it away. Punishment, release. Something to distract myself from it. I know this. It's been over a year since I last cut. Since I last started cracking under this. I won't kill myself. I know I'm strong enough-- no, I know I'm too afraid to do it. But the cutting helps. I never swore it off, didn't tell myself I'd stop. But I want it, and I don't. I want to stay clean. I want the release and I fear the repercussions. Once you start again, it's so much harder to stop. If I start cutting again, where will it end, what will it stop at? I don't want to have to hide under hoodies and thick clothing again. It's summer. I could cut somewhere else on my body. Don't.How do I get these thoughts out of my head? This want. I should throw the razors away but I don't want to. It's like having a security blanket, as sick as that sounds. Saying "if things get really bad, too bad to handle, you'll have something sterile and clean instead of using something bad like a pencil sharpener." I want it. I want it. I need it. I want to cut. I don't want to. I won't. I can't. Throw them away. Don't throw them away. Keep them, safe, locked up. Sick, unhealthy, these thoughts are eating me up.... but writing it out helps. I think I can stop myself from doing it for now. But I still want it. How do you handle this without going mad? I feel like I'm tearing myself apart. When the urge comes, whispering, screaming, crying, it bangs around inside my head and I feel like I'll drown under it. Just one little.... no. Help me...
I've had depression for years and got worse once I started college. At the time, I was suffering from suicidal thoughts and I started to SH. Now its been a year since I last SHed, and I'm feeling like that again. I want to cut and hurt myself, I hate myself, and I hate all of it. I look and feel ugly. I cannot make new relationships, I'm timid as fuck. I hate everything about me. My wrists feel smooth and perfect for a slice.I hate all of this. Myself especially. I don't know how to go on like this.
So i'm 16. I am a sophomore  in high school, and i have been cutting for two years. Last Monday, it was hot, because i live in MI and it is summer. I had recently run out of makeup to caver my scars and cuts, so i had no choice but to wear a hoodie. I had finished my english exam and i was reading when my english teacher, who is one of my favorites, walks by and hands me a note. It reads:Broken_Artist,I recieved an email from a friend this weekend who is concerned about you and some behaviors that might not be healthy. I'd like to talk with you about this. Would you like to go out into the hall now or wait until after you've finished your 7th hour exam?My heart literally sunk while reading this. I knew i had to look up at him to convey my message of "how the f*** did you find this out" but i was too ashamed to look at him. I guess he somehow got this because he walked by my desk and quietly asked me to join him in the hallway. I ffollowed him, but i was more like a puppet. In the beginning, i was so close to tears i couldn't even look him in the eye. He started by telling me how i was lucky to have such good friends who were concerned about me. He didn't know who it was, they hadn't given a name. He asked me if there was anybody at school who i was comfortable talking to. I said no. He asked if there were anbody out of school. I said no, and this time i was very very very close to crying. He sighed and somehow managed to look me in the eye. "Don't worry, you are not in trouble. You haven't done anything wrong. I'm here for you.". And for some reason those words made a world of difference. Being a teacher, he had to inform my mom, but he agreed that i could do it instead of him calling her. When all exploded that night, i emailed him.Mr. C,Why do you even care? I'm just another statistic. We have two days of school left. You could have continued on with your life, ignored that email, and everything would be fine. Why do you even care? This was his response. Broken_Artist, You are not just "another statistic;" you are an intelligent young lady who has a lot to offer the world and who owes it to herself to be taken care of and respected.  I care because students like you are the reason I stay in teaching; because I get to spend my day with kids who have the possibility to change their world as well as my own.  Whether or not you believe this, you are worth caring about and fighting for.  That is why your friend chose to email us, that is why I spoke with you this morning, and that is why it is so important that you spoke with your mom this evening.  And as for statistics, I once heard that 92% of all statistics are inaccurate :).Mr. CThis became the start of a cery long and emotional email chain, and now i feel closer to him than i do my own parents. My mom is kind of understanding, but not really, and my dad i just freaking pissed that i got other people involved in our lives. He keeps saying how my teacher is going to call social services and get me locked away and get my parents in trouble, but i know that can't happen. So now i am just sitting here, pretty much numb and emotionally exhausted. I figured out that writing helps fight the SH urges, so i decided to write this post. I probably won't tell Mr. C about this, but i don't know...TL;DR, a mysterious friend emailed a teacher about my SH, leading to explosions of emotions and secrets, and then a very deep friendship is formed.
Hey y'allits been awhile since I posted but a long time lurker none the less.  short story ive been dealing with my regular gp, specialists, group / one on one therapy and this subreddit for about three years nowits been a long journey.  literally a life time and a life time to goan hour or so ago I walked out of my specialist office for my monthly visit.  I was deemed "stabilized" all things considered.  as such I wont have to see the specialist any time soon. im still seeing my gp and group / one on one therapy....the specialist visits will be reviewed in the next few months when I have my nine to twelve month evaluation.its not much but at least its progress....thank you all for sharing and supporting each othercheers*broknbones*
After months of being clean, I cut once again. I don't know what came over me. I regret it. Afterwards I was shaking uncontrollably and could barely breathe. I just need some encouragement to not continue right now...
May 30th was the day. This is the longest I have gone without cutting, well, ever. Since I started when I was 13. In ten years. I tried quitting once, only lasted 10 months, which was pretty good I'll admit, but I fell off the wagon. That was about 4 years ago. This time, I didn't quit for anyone. I didn't even really try to quit as much as I started therapy, got new tools, and a lot in my life just... changed. Despite last year being the hardest year of my fucking life, I managed to quit cutting. Somehow.I really hope it sticks. I really hope that I don't relapse. I almost have a couple of times, but I feel confident. I still have urges. Often. But I've removed a lot of the triggers from my life, which were mostly toxic people/relationships. One year ago I was freshly recovering from a date rape. I'm still recovering, but last year... it was bad. I had no idea how to cope, so obviously I went to cutting. I don't know why I'm posting. I guess I just wanted to share it somewhere someone might understand, because I am so proud of myself. Thanks for reading. 
I'm taking pysch 101 at my school and today we watched a video that involved a severely suicidal woman, it threw me right back to where I used to be two years ago. I actually relived the pain and the incredible urge to die. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't breathe and ended up puking in a school toilet. I got drunk tonight because my roommates were drinking and I thought I would be ok. I'm not. There's so much blood thanks to the alcohol content in my bloodstream. I also took some pills. I'm not sure I'm ok or that I should be posting here, but I think I might cut more if I don't. I don't know. I just feel awful and I'm going to feel worse about it in the morning. I can't breathe with how awful this all is. Why is this so hard?
Last Tuesday I cut for the first time in a year. Last Thursday I cut again. I've depression has been throwing everything it could at me to make it happen again. But it won't win. It was relieving for a bit, sure.  But that isn't worth the week after, the extra pain. When my loved ones found out, they weren't disappointed in me, even though it felt that way at the time. They were sad, and worried, because they didn't want to lose me. Because they didn't want to see me in pain. Worried they weren't doing enough for me. The last week has been horrible and wonderful. Horrible in the sense that my depression has been exceptionally bad. Wonderful in the sense that the extra support from my loved ones- my dad after I cut myself, my sister and girlfriend and brother and mom after they found out- has made me feel loved and special. But more importantly, for the first time in a long while, I feel like I deserve to feel loved. And I didn't know realize how much I missed that feeling until it returned.I'm also worried. Worried that my depression will convince me that cutting myself is the easiest way to show others I need their help, instead of asking for it. Worried that my urges will never go away. Worried that people will stop trying to show me love because I look like I'm being smothered by it. Worried that I'll relapse again. Worried that people will get tired of helping me, worried that people will give up on me. Worried I won't make it. Thanks for reading
I realize a couple weeks ago that this year is 10 years of self harming (started when I was 11). I've tried to stop and sometimes I'll go months without it, but I always come back to cutting. If I'm not, I'm usually out self destructing in another slightly more "socially acceptable" way, like drinking and sleeping around. Sometimes drugs. Regardless, I've never found a not harmful way to deal with things. I feel childish and stupid, because I always cut my arms and rarely wear long sleeves. It's not because I want attention, I usually wear a brace so people can't see them and brush it off as my tendinitis bothering me. But at the same time, I want someone to notice that I'm hurting and fucked up and actually give a shit, ya know? I just don't get why it's so hard to stop harming. And why, if I'm being completely honest, I don't actually want to stop. 
Hi, I just found this sub and I thought I'd ask if anyone else punches themselves instead of cutting for self harm.  I obviously am actively trying to stop myself from doing it, but I was wondering if anyone who punched as well wanted to chat, because for me talking to someone like me helps me to reflect, understand myself, and come to a rational conclusion about things.  Thanks!
Honestly, just curious. I don't ever cut deep enough to cause serious harm and it serves as a nice escape mechanism.
I am craving the feeling of cutting for the past couple weeks and do not want to "relapse" as I have not done it for a couple months. I am basically alone in this and I struggle with encouragement and the ability to help myself. Any tips for how to encourage yourself when alone and wanting to cut? 
I need advice, as I'm 99% certain my brother is depressed and sec harming, I just don't know how to help him, and he would never admit it to me as he wants to protect me. I just want advice on how I can help him in any way...
i feel like I can never quite catch up with my mind sometimes..actually, like all of the time. There are moments where I feel i have caught up and feel good and fine and blissful, sober moments too, but then there are my regular days where I know something is off but I am unsure what.. it just feels like my depression always wins. Its there, always. In the tidiest of corners, then there are days where it gets bad, and it overcomes me...and moments like now, where all I want is to feel better and to escape, there's this rush of endorphins when i think about cutting or hitting myself.....how do you escape that? Or overcome that? I'm trying so hard right now but the only way i can think of is taking pills/doing drugs which I know in the back of my mind is unhealthy, but when I'm in this kind of mindset i can not escape it. It's so difficult. Moreso than anything I've ever faced in my life.
This is my first reddit post ever, sorry in advance if I am not clear.  I hope this post is okay in the subreddit.My self harming has been getting worst and I was hoping for some support/advice. I want to stop self harming or at least slow it down. I was hoping that someone else who has managed to control their urges to self harm could tell me what has helped them. I am a male college student in my twenties. I started self harming in my mid teens, but it was very mild. As I got older, the self harming got a little worse, but still pretty mild. I became kind of addicted to the pain. I kept my self harming secret, none of my friends knew. When I started college, my self harming got a lot worse. I picked an extremely demanding major, and was under a lot of stress. I self harmed as a way of relieving stress. I tried many different types of self harm. I got into extreme sexual-type self harming.At one point I was so bad, I was considering suicide. I am safely past that, however I am still self harming. A year ago, I had had to go to the doctors once due to a deep cut. The doctor could tell I had self harmed. I did not want to about it at the time and he just got really frustrated with me. My parents found out that I went to the doctors and I think they knew that I had hurt myself. I told them I did not want to talk about it and after a while they stopped asking questions. I still live with my parents and there is no way for me to go to the doctors again without them knowing so I have not tried talking with any other doctors. (And I am very scared to go to doctors in general)Some days it was not bad and and I did not think about self harming. And other days, it was all I could think about. Things have been getting worse these last four months. I have definitely caused damage to my body, although I do not know how permanent it will be. A lot of people think I am a perfect saint. This is partly why I have kept my self harming a secret. I do not want to hurt the ones I love by letting them know about this. I have no one to talk to in real life. I am too afraid to get professional help. I have been praying and searching the internet for advice. It has lead me here. I want to fight against the continuous cycle of self harm. Thank you for your help. I will try to respond to any questions.
I keep thinking about it, fantasizing. My heart needs that relief. I've put ice on my wrist for the past hour as a coping method. Snapped rubber bands. I still feel similarly.But ya know, all I really need to do is get through *today*, right? I just need to keep using the coping skills, even if they don't feel like they're working strongly, until tomorrow.Tomorrow will be a better day. I'm just struggling a lot at the moment. Miss drinking, miss cutting. Just want to disappear and not be responsible. Any other good coping skills you guys like to use besides rubber bands and ice?The ice is kind of triggering because I could burn myself chemically with ice.
I saw this vidoe of a guy talking about his opinion on cuting. It made me feel sick and disgusted at humanity. After watching 2 minutes of this video i feel really bad. But i really want to know what you guys here think about this. **Warning this video is offensive and may trigger you**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PShA2q0NgiY
I am trying so hard to get better. I had a session  with my support group.  It just left me feeling fragile like glass. I feel one touch one word and I will shatter. It would be so easy to stop these feelings but I know I have to let myself feel them. I hate accessing memories best left forgotten. I know I have to to get better but why does it have to hurt so much. I hate feeling venerable. I hate the tears. I hate the fact that I wasted so many years punishing myself for what others have done.i want to be numb again but I know that's not the answer. I just want this nightmare to stop. I wanted to god how I wanted to cut but I didn't. Now instead I feel broken drained and so very tired. I don't know if I am strong enough to do this. I just want it all to end.
I personally don't believe that self harm is that wrong, especially if it's not deep enough to kill. Just a little temporary pain to reflect how I'm feeling internally? My friend saw my scars while I was changing and told me she got scared but I look at my scars and don't really feel anything anymore. And a question - is it dangerous to cut your wrists? I've been mostly cutting on my forearm.
I have been married for almost 6 years. We have 2 children.In many arguments with my wife, I get to point where I just get so angry that I want to disappear and stop existing. Last night I banged my head really hard into a wall, and smashed a hard stereo/boom box on my head several times. I still have a knot on my head.Other times I have smashed my head on a hard tile floor, on a ceramic bathtub or with hard heavy books.I have punched walls and windows and kicked in cabinet doors.I have never hit my wife and feel that I would never hit her. Last night she was standing in my way to keep me from leaving the bedroom, and I didn't push her or try to move her out of the way. (This was after I had already banged my head in the wall and gone thru a drawer looking for something sharp to stab myself with). So, I am not a violent person towards other people, just towards myself (although it is certainly scary for her).I did go digging thru a knife drawer last night but have never cut myself or attempted suicide. We have a shotgun in the house but it is disassembled and the ammunition is not easy to get to. However, I am sure of it was assembled it would be much easier for me to blow my head off in a fit of rage, which is part of the reason I have never put it together. I only feel suicidal during these arguments with the wife. It is like it is an extension of wanting the pain to stop and just wanting to disappear. It doesn't happen in all arguments, just ones where I get really angry and feel abandoned to wallow in my pain, or when the argument hair keeps going and going and going with no resolution.I do not want to die in general. Just during arguments. I just want the pain to stop. I love my family and I enjoy spending time with them.What can I do? I feel mindless during these times. I don't feel that I am choosing to smash my head in, it is like it is automatic. Like I went from crying to immediately smashing my head on the wall. So it is hard to know when it is coming. It is hard to tell myself to leave the situation before it gets to that point, because it is like I could be having a regular argument and then a switched is flipped and I want to die and disappear.I am aware of the good things in my life whilst I am not angry, all of those things drop away though and don't have any bearing on me not banging my head.What can I do?I don't want to die. I don't want to lose my wife.We are currently in couples therapy, and I have been on a gamut of different antidepressants over the past several years, but none of them have had any real effect on me. I was never like this before I met my wife. It makes me sad, embarrassed, ashamed, and scared.Please help me.
...I had over 100 days free of self harm but on the 16th I relapsed and took a minor overdose of pills ... Not enough to be hospitalized like usual but enough to make myself feel really sick ... I dont know why I did it, it was dumb and now I have to start counting my "clean" time again. Anyone have any wisdom to impart upon me?
Hi there! Want to help other people understand self-injury? Right now, very little is known about what leads people to self-injure on a day-to-day basis. The Personality and Emotion Research Lab (PERL), a research team from Simon Fraser University in Canada, is conducting a study to learn more about the experiences of people who self-harm, and we want your help! We are interested in how emotions, life experiences, thoughts, and coping styles affect non-suicidal self-injury. We hope that this research will help other people understand more about why people self-injure and what they can do to help.  What you can do: If you want to participate in this confidential study, you will answer questions about self-injury, emotions, and life events. This study consists of 2 main components: 1) One-time, online questionnaires (approx. 1.5 hours) 2) Brief daily online questionnaires for 14 days Who can participate: We are looking for people, age 19 or older, who live in North America, and are currently self-harming (whether you are trying to stop or not), and have self-harmed more than once within the last month. What’s in it for you: Individuals who choose to participate will receive a $10 online gift card in appreciation for completing part 1 of this study. Participants will receive an additional $20 gift card for completing the daily questionnaires. Furthermore, participants will receive an extra $5 if they complete the questionnaires on at least 6 out of 7 days, for each week. Therefore, participants will receive between $20 and $30 in part 2 of this study, and a total of $30 to $40 as appreciation for completing the entire study. Additionally, telling us about your experiences will give us important information on what leads to self-injury on a day-to-day basis, and could help develop and improve treatments for people who want to stop self-injuring. Individual participants will never be identified in the results of this research. Please contact us at knwalter@sfu.ca if you are interested in participating or if you have any questions. Please include only the answers to the following questions (do not restate the questions): 1) When was the last time you injured yourself (e.g., cut, burned, or scratched) on purpose, without intending to die? Please answer in the following format - DAY/MONTH/YEAR 2) Approximately how many times in the past month have you deliberately injured yourself (e.g., cut, burned or scratched yourself on purpose) without intending to die? Thank you,  Personality and Emotion Research Laboratory Simon Fraser University
I thought I was doing really good. I haven't had an episode for a couple of months. I really did try to be good. I can't help overthink  things and ended up burning my arm with my cigarette. I couldn't let the one I was with see a new cut so I felt compelled  to do something else. Now every time I light one  I want to hold it to my flesh just to help quiet the voices. I don't know what to do anymore. I give up.

Pretty much says it in the title. I don't even have a good reason too. It was just that urge that made me. Even though I've been seven months clean of cutting I'm an addict to it and am back at square one. I just feel so upset with myself now don't really know what to do. How do you deal with a relapse. I just feel so stupid. I'm 20 for gods sake. 
I don't have the energy to wake up in the morning. The thought of getting up and having to go about normal life makes me want to cry. Thankfully I'm done with my exams and am on summer vacation so I slept in today. Until my mom choked me awake for sleeping too long and then kicked me. Neither were too painful and they didn't leave much damage. I know she feels bad about it every time she does it but I'm so tired of trying to understand. I relapsed and slashed through half my arm. The funniest thing is, she's seen them all and pretends they don't exist.I wish I could crawl into a dark hole and never wake up.
Just to start off, I personally enjoy self harm. I SH for a variety of reasons. The majority of my self harm has been non-suicidal, I sometimes do it to punish myself, or to 'feel something' when I feel numb, or sometimes because I get an endorphin rush like none other.Methods vary from cutting, burning, punching solid objects, even chemical burns.I'm genuinely interested if people would be willing to share other reasons why they themselves SH.
Everyone around me keeps telling me that I need to stop, and how bad it is for me, but I don't want to stop. Honestly it's the only thing I find relief in, the only way I can express my body hatred and the only thing I actually have control over in my life.I just want to continue and not be judged for it, or find a way to hide it forever. Instead it feels like I'm forever disappointing people :(
I had stopped cutting for about two years now, it was hard at first but once I stopped doing things like drinking alone or in excess it became much easier. And really having the scars as a constant reminder of messing up was helpful in its own way.Two days ago I ended up going to a bar by myself and drinking way more than I should have, when I ended up back at my home I was in one of the cutting moods that I get often but usually just for a few minutes until I cast away the thoughts but this time I dwelt on it and decided to do it again.I ended up doing 4 shallow cuts that are extremely superficial on my wrist before I came to my senses and realized all the embarrassment I get from my scars and why would I want more so I stopped. But the last two days I have felt drained, I hate that I fell back into my old ways and I hate that I need to start hiding my arms again, I had just gained enough confidence to start going to class without my hoodie.I'm not even why I'm sharing this with anyone, I guess I really just want to get it off my chest and maybe hear from others who know what it's like and not feel like a freak for asking for advice.
Hello.I have scars all over both my arms, some on my chest and legs.I suffer from depression and severe social anxiety, and the fact that I have all these scars from self harm isn't exactly helping. I'm scared to death of showing any skin on my body to anyone due to these scars, so far I have only told 2 online friends(friends from Steam, a gaming platform) that I have self harm problems, it helps me to vent/let it out to someone I trust, as I am so scared to tell anyone I know in real life.No matter where I go, cold or super hot I always wear a sweater or something similar to hide any scars, and it's not always... ideal to wear a super warm sweater in super warm weather.I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how to become not so paranoid about the matter so I can maybe... not wear a sweater or whatever no matter what I do/where I go, and just how to become more... comfortable(?).Edit: I also have a problem that occurs sometimes where I for days(sometimes in bad situations, for over a week) don't want to eat at all to the point where it's dangerous. When this happens and I eventually say to myself "Stop it, you have to eat, now." I just... I can't control it but I force my self to puke it up later. I don't know what I can do to stop this.
1. Only a few very sick people self-injure. **FALSE**Approximately 1 percent of the population has, at one time or another, used self-inflicted physical injury as a means of coping with an overwhelming situation or feeling.2. Teens who hurt themselves are trying to commit suicide, but they don't have the nerve. **FALSE**While some teens who self-injure are also suicidal and think often about death, most teens say that when they self-injure they are not trying to die. Most say that their self-injury is a way of coping with the pain in their lives, and some say that it has become just a habit.3. There are many ways that people self-injure. **TRUE**Self-injury is defined as intentionally hurting yourself. People find many ways to do this, but most commonly they cut or burn their skin.4. People who self-injure are crazy and should be put in hospitals. **FALSE**According to Tracy Alderman, author of The Scarred Soul, most self-inflicted wounds are not life-threatening and may not even require medical attention. Some teens are put in hospitals because the adults in their lives are afraid and don't know what else to do. Experts in this field have suggested that hospitalization can actually make matters worse. Most teens who hurt themselves are trying to find control in their lives, and involuntary hospitalization makes them feel worse, potentially leading to even more self-injury.5. Teens who self-injure are just trying to get attention from their parents. **FALSE**Some teens say that they began to self-injure when they were trying to get attention for their emotional troubles, but when they thought about it, they realized that their behavior was really a silent cry for help and not designed to attract attention. In fact, the majority of teens who hurt themselves go to great lengths to hide their scars and their behaviors from adults, particularly their parents. Many professionals believe that all psychological symptoms are ways of trying to get help, but the symptoms are often so disguised that people don't recognize them for what they are. That is, of course, a big part of the problem.6. Self-inflicted wounds are a way of being accepted at school. **FALSE**While some teens will form a clique with other teens who self-injure, very few teens say that they harm themselves just to be a part of a group. There is an expression that "misery loves company," and it is more likely that teens who are unhappy find comfort in being around other teens with similar feelings.7. Only teens who have other serious psychological problems will harm themselves. **FALSE**While it is true that some teens who self-injure do have other very serious problems, which they may have had for many years, this is certainly not the case with everyone.8. If your wounds are superficial, your self-injury may just be a phase. **FALSE**The severity of self-injury has very little to do with the feelings you might have. People have different tolerances to pain and they have different ways to hurt themselves. When teens hurt themselves, it should be taken seriously.9. Girls and boys typically self-injure in different ways. **TRUE**While it is true that girls more commonly fall into a pattern of self-injury, there are many boys who do this too. Some people think that girls who self-injure are just found out more often than boys. Others think that boys are more indirect in seeking self-injury and are more likely to hurt themselves through high-risk behaviors, such as extreme sports.
I self-harmed for years but stopped about 5 years ago, albeit with a few minor incidences. I turned to food and heavy alcohol use instead and have gained a lot of weight. Recently my boyfriend was found to have very high triglycerides in addition to being overweight like me and he is putting us on a strict diet. My problem is that I don't know any other way to cope with negative emotions. I feel so trapped and anxious. Any ideas anyone could share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
I was clean for 3 months then last night I relapsed and I want to do it again so bad. Help!
After six months of cutting, I relapsed. I relapsed because I lost my sister as a family member. But something else happened, I found out my boyfriend, his name is Parker,cheated on me with 'a hundred different girls'.  Also, he  used me as a back up chick. He called me his bitch, so therefore im not even a lover to him. The problem is, I still love him to death. I have a new boyfriend, but I love Parker way more. In fact I wish we were still together. We dont talk because he lost his phone and he goes to a different school. I found out what he was doing when his friend Hunter kiked me and told me. I miss him so much and cry. I cut. My mom saw my cuts and took the razors. I just wish I was dead.
I miss it so much. Don't know how much longer I can go on without doing it. My therapist got a better job so for the time being I have no one to talk to.  My head feels like it's spinning, call for some cuts. I can get away with it, I can.
Oh go it happened    I just relapsed and cut a lot after getting a lot of harsh comments from both my parents and I just feel so disgusting 
My instagram is the same as my username and i'd love for some of you guys to see it, i just want to share how i feel but i have noone
This is a throwaway, generally as I am really struggling today and I need to talk or at least get this out of my system.I've been binge/purging for the last 6 months because I cant deal with how empty and numb I feel. It is the only thing I felt that I could control but clearly I can't as I've got obsessive over my weight and how much I eat and exercise now just to stop going back to how I felt. I've also been exercise till I collapse and vomit and abusing laxatives.I shared this with my husband and mother last night, I feel so ashamed.. so I tonight I sat in a bath and contemplated cutting myself. I ended up cutting my fingers up just from pure frustration and stopped before I got any further.I am at a loss, I don't want to start down this path but I don't think I have the energy anymore, I just give up.
I don't really know what I'm asking for with this post, but I really need to share. Two months ago I thought I was recovering, today the number of cuts has grown unreasonable. They're small, shallow, pretty much just look like random scratches and I'm clumsy enough to mostly explain them away. Except I spent half an hour yesterday listening to my friend as we were getting ready exclaim over how ridiculous my leg looked. She laughed, and joked that it looked like I'd been cutting myself with a razor. Except it was that kind of joke that also may have been a question, or a statement. Like she was telling me to cut that shit out because she didn't need it. We're not that close of friends, so really thats the only response I'd be comfortable with from her. I just had to sit there joking about it and really really fucking hoping it was a joke. I wanted to say it wasn't a razor it was scissors. I wanted to curl up and dissapear. I wanted my leg to be clean. I'm supposed to call and make an appointment to see a new therapist since I moved to a new city. I haven't ever regularly seen a therapist. I haven't ever been fully honest with a therapist. I've been supposed to call for over 4 months. I'm drowning, but I can't save myself even though I know how to swim. I know all these things that I should do, but no matter how hard I try I can't make myself. Or maybe that's a lie too, maybe I'm not really trying. I don't know, I just know that I've got to clean up my act soon before I spiral completely out of control again. Thanks for reading my little rant I guess. Sorry it's not all that much of a well formulated post.

I am 24 guy and I just failed two classes. I have had a horrible semester dealing with my depression. I just didn't have the motivation to do anything. I didn't tell anyone in my family about any of this and now it the end of the semester and I do t know what to do. I have a history of cutting and I am very tempted right now to cut. I feel like I need to be punished or somehow by cutting will make me feel better. I don't want to hurt my self.  Please Help!! 
I miss cutting SO much. It's been a month and a half, and I NEED to do it again.My head feels heavy and I feel so weak. I have to re-set myself with my bloody release. I'm ready to mess myself the fuck up.Please God, make me a stone.
About 3 weeks ago I started dating this wonderful girl. I noticed her scars across her legs & arms, but I always tried to not make a big deal about it. It's not like I didn't care, because I do. I just didn't want to make her feel less beautiful. I guess I also thought that she'd stop harming herself as long as she was happy, so I made sure to always keep her happy. It was working perfectly until a couple of days ago. Her best friend had some sort of short relationship with one of *my* friends, which ended pretty quickly. This girl ended up coming between several of my friends since she slept with 2 of them and kissed another. This escalated into a huge mess which has yet to be solved. It has come to the point of splitting up my friends completely, and it scares me to death.My gf (the girl I mentioned dating) feels completely guilty about this mess and says things like "I should have known. I could have stopped her. How could i let this happen". And as the situation keeps spiraling out of control for each day that goes by, my gf feels worse. I keep explaining to her that no one blames her for this incident and that she shouldn't have to worry, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. Today she blocked her best friend on every social media imaginable. She's so incredibly angry about her best friend's actions and she's cutting herself again. I have no idea what to do. She turned off her phone. She doesn't live with her family due to physical and psychological abuse and has no one to talk to. She wrote a desperate blog-post, before disappearing, about her panic attacks and about wanting to die. I'm not worried that she'll kill herself. I just know it in my heart that she wouldn't. This situation is nothing compared to what she's been through, and I know she's so much stronger than that. I just never want her to hurt herself ever again. I feel like I can't do anything about it, and it's really weighing me down. What do I do?This post became so much longer than intended. If anyone read this; Thank you.
I have some times in my life where I feel like suicide and self harm is the only way to stop feeling emotional pain, then later on I realize this is wrong.But it's still there, I've tried distracting myself when I feel suicidal, but I want to see if you guys have better ways to keep yourself busy or something to not do it right at the moment.Thanks anyway...
Yesterday I cut myself again.  I don't know why I do it, I get really emotional at night for some reason.  I don't really have access to a proper blade so I literally just saw at myself with a dull one until it works in some kind of emotional trance.  I cut around my upper leg area, because I'm scared of people seeing them.  I just hate myself so much and don't know how to stop, I don't even know what I'm doing until after it's too late.
I have a condition called dermographia where my skin welts from something as simple as being stroked. I've got quite a few self-harm scars on my left forearm and we were talking about my dermographia on a bus to a horse-back ride with my friends. This friend of mine had seen the condition first-hand and we were trying to find a good way to show those who hadn't seen it, as I was trying to explain. She sees my scars, thinks they're welts, and goes "Like those!" I had no idea what to say. It was 90 degrees outside. I hadn't been able to wear long sleeves that day.
My sister (14f) was hospitalized from self harm last year, and has apparently returned to it recently. She doesn't live close enough to me to see her often, but I want so badly to do something. I feel powerless knowing that she is suffering. I know not to just approach her with "why don't you just stop?". What could I say or do for her that may help? Any advice would be great. Thanks.
I don't even know where to start..my self harm has turned into some kind of morbid art project..I should stop but it's the only coping mechanism I know..thoughts and comments would be appreciated..
I really have the urge to hurt myself again today. I feel as though I could just go to the store and purchase the means to do it and get on with it and I would feel so much better. But on the other hand I know that the feeling of relief would only be temporary and then I would have to deal with the repercussions of my behavior and that would suck. Im so torn, I dont know what to do.
I'm suppose to go hiking up to a hot springs with my mom in a couple of hours. I relapsed a few days ago. She's gonna see the new scars and be so disappointed... happy mother's day...
I have a lot on my plate right now, finals, bad grades (I'm only a sophomore in high school but it's going to fuck my transcript), anxiety, ocd, depression, the whole fucking nine yards. My stress level, it feels, is at its apex and I don't know what to do-- is it worth it, cutting? If it relieves stress? It's worked before. I mean it's better than constant nightmares and angry outbursts-- right? Someone please convince me otherwise.
Hey ya'll, About a year maybe more ago I was working on a project here. I asked if people wanted to write out their stories and I would read them in a video. I got really good response and it helped some people not only share their stories but let others know they aren't alone. I had to put the project on hold for various reasons and am now able to start again. This post is to gauge interest. If this is something that you want to know more of message me and if enough people are interested I'll make a more formal post. 
Two nights ago was my first time self harming. Then yesterday I did it again twice. I don't know why I started and when I first did it I started crying and immediately messaged my friends wondering what was wrong with me. Some of my friends have stopped talking to me, and most of them have said to promise not to cut anymore. But I can't just promise? It's like promising not to lie anymore, I can promise but it won't always be true.Is self harm really that bad? I haven't cut all that deep and I'm really clean about it... I used rubbing alcohol and vaseline for the cuts and cleaned them..Can someone just talk to me about this? I'm confused and upset. Today one of my friends saw my cuts and asked about them, I said they were from a sport and she remarked they looked like a bear had cut me.
I've been supporting her and now she's going to have to hold me up because we've seemingly traded places. It's not good but I don't want to bring her down, she deserves to be happy and I need to keep that going. Any help?
I'm graduating from college on Saturday (yay!) but unfortunately have self harm scars all over my arms and legs. In general, I have gotten relatively comfortable with wearing clothes that show my scars because my university is in Texas and I can't exactly wear long sleeves and pants all the time. However, a lot of family will be attending my graduation, and none of them know about my self harm. Maybe one day I'll tell some of them, but this is just not the time for them to find out. Of course, at the actual ceremony I'll be wearing a cap and gown, so it shouldn't be a problem, but I'm going to dinner with my dad and his girlfriend the night before and then to lunch with my mom and her family after the ceremony and REALLY need a way of hiding the scars, particularly on Saturday, as my mom seems to have her heart set on me wearing a dress to the graduation lunch. Anyone have any experience with this that might help? 
Hi there! Want to help other people understand self-injury? Right now, very little is known about what leads people to self-injure on a day-to-day basis. The Personality and Emotion Research Lab (PERL), a research team from Simon Fraser University in Canada, is conducting a study to learn more about the experiences of people who self-harm, and we want your help! We are interested in how emotions, life experiences, thoughts, and coping styles affect non-suicidal self-injury. We hope that this research will help other people understand more about why people self-injure and what they can do to help.  What you can do: If you want to participate in this confidential study, you will answer questions about self-injury, emotions, and life events. This study consists of 2 main components: 1) One-time, online questionnaires (approx. 1.5 hours) 2) Brief daily online questionnaires for 14 days Who can participate: We are looking for people, age 19 or older, who live in North America, and are currently self-harming (whether you are trying to stop or not), and have self-harmed more than once within the last month. What’s in it for you: Individuals who choose to participate will receive a $10 online gift card in appreciation for completing part 1 of this study. Participants will receive an additional $20 gift card for completing the daily questionnaires. Furthermore, participants will receive an extra $5 if they complete the questionnaires on 6 out of 7 days, for each week. Therefore, participants will receive between $20 and $30 in part 2 of this study, and a total of $30 to $40 as appreciation for completing the entire study. Additionally, telling us about your experiences will give us important information on what leads to self-injury on a day-to-day basis, and could help develop and improve treatments for people who want to stop self-injuring. Individual participants will never be identified in the results of this research. Please contact us at knwalter@sfu.ca if you are interested in participating or if you have any questions. Please include only the answers to the following questions (do not restate the questions): 1) When was the last time you injured yourself (e.g., cut, burned, or scratched) on purpose, without intending to die? Please answer in the following format - DAY/MONTH/YEAR 2) Approximately how many times in the past month have you deliberately injured yourself (e.g., cut, burned or scratched yourself on purpose) without intending to die? Thank you,  Personality and Emotion Research Laboratory Simon Fraser University
She messaged me on facebook saying that she saw my cuts from about 2 weeks ago and that if I ever need anything she's here for me. I know that her intentions were good and I appreciate the gesture, but I'm more embarrassed than touched. I hate having to wear long sleeves everywhere and it was a really hot day when I last saw her but I figured I could just keep my arm turned away. Apparently I was wrong. I guess the shame is kind of good in a way, because it motivates me to not do it again.
This is a kinda long story. My fiance and I have been together since nov 2013, and wanted to wait a solid year before we moved in together. Our move in date was May 1st. I am disabled by my mental health (depression, agoraphobia, anxiety- about 10 pills to get through the day and get to sleep), I go to a support group and therapy weekly. When he, my fiance is around I feel safe and able to do more things. This was a big thing for me to look forward to, as a person who hadn't had much to look forwards to.Well he got into some trouble with someone he ought not have had anything to do with because of her age (that happened years before we met). He had been going to one pointless court date after another until the one last Thursday where he got a year probation. His lawyer, an experienced fellow, predicted an outcome of a fee/fine or dismissal, as this was only a misdemeanor. He's trying to get his probation transferred from there to here. So now we're fucked, had to let go of the apartment and everything associated.I can't do anything, shop, walk around the house without thinking about the fact that we should be picking those out, is he going to help me drive my son (they're close, considering we they only have every few months to see each other) to school. I cut twice. Since all methods of cutting have been removed I ordered a box cutter which has been sitting in the mailbox two days. I cry off and on most of the time. This seems to have pushed me over the edge. I see my therapist today and that's great, but it's an hour then back to being alone. I can only do partial hospitalization, I have a 5 year old and my mother can't really take care of him in the day time.I know this wasn't done to intentionally hurt me (this stupid shit he did a few years ago and getting probation). I feel broken. I feel like cutting almost all the time. I've even been thinking about taking specific pills in excess. I'm 33 and things haven't gotten better, the last few years they've been getting worse. 
For 9 months I had been free of any kind of self harm. And then yesterday, I left the lights on in the garage... It's been a long day, a long month, a long year. I'm trying so hard to come out of this depression and the toxic environment I'm in. Suddenly I thought, if I can't even remember to turn the lights off, how can I ever do all the things it will take for me to function in society again? It feels impossible. And as I was thinking this, I was applying deodorant; on impulse I took the deodorant stick and cracked myself over the head with it hard enough to leave a slight lump. I regret it now. Clearly I'm too hard on myself, and the most important thing is to be able to forgive yourself for failures in a healthy manner- not to be free of failure, because nobody is. 
the wound is kind of deep,but its very large compared to my other cuts.its still bleeding after 6 hours,its the first time this happened to me.im scared i will get an infection and have to go the doctor.should it be taking this long to stop bleeding?
I've always loved hugs and spooning and whatever. And I guess I noticed I want someone to hold me when I'm anxious or feel like cutting. But the other day, I felt intense anxiety in semi-public. I was with a friend and he noticed and just hugged me really tight. I think he was actually trying to restrain me because he knows I've done dangerous things in the past.Anyway, it was a lot of pressure (he's a fairly big guy) and I really think it helped.Anyway, I was wondering if there's any way to simulate being held? My therapist suggested a weighted blanket but those are a pricy investment for something that may not do anything. Obviously, hugs and whatever are nice, but that's not practical and I'd feel weird asking. Massages help a lot with anxiety but I can't exactly go for one 24/7.Am I alone in this feeling? Can anyone think of something that may help?
Ive been self-harm free for the last 100 Days and counting. Hardest thing Ive ever done, but I'm really proud of myself.
So, I just recently stumbled on this subreddit, and I guess I just wanted people going through similar struggles to hear my story.Where to begin? A few months ago I was released from the hospital after a suicide attempt, and before that I had been cutting for months on my hips. I had no one to talk to about it, and every time I went to my parents for support about it, they reacted in anger, with no compassion and just sort of gave up on me. I didn't ever want to tell my friends because I always wanted to be there for them, and I didn't want to be a burden. So it got worse, I started drinking to try and numb my feelings and for a while, it helped, but then it only got worse. The night of my suicide I had written farewell notes to all of my friends and family and had traveled to a bridge before having a horrifying moment of clarity I called my parents. They drove me to the E.R, and then a sub acute inpatient facility, and I stayed there for a month with people going through the same struggles, and honestly, it was one of the most strange, sad, and amazing moments of my life. My peers there were for the most part were just people who had forgotten how amazing and wonderful they were. We all gave each other so much help. In addition, my SO visited me as often as she could, helping me recover, and showing me so much love.After being deemed safe to return back to the real world, I was given my belt and sweatpants with drawstrings still in them, along with a moth's worth of back work from classes. I returned to school to have friends asking me where I had been the past month, and I gave them an easy lie of "the flu that became pneumonia." I'm not sure if anyone bought it, but nobody really ever knew how bad my problems had been pre-hospital. I had to do weekly check ins with multiple therapists and psychologists, and for a while, I got better.I pulled my grades up, I cleaned up. Things have been going good.Then I relapsed, my parents and I got in a huge fight because they were really mad at me for not following their arbitrary rules, I spiraled and cut. I did it with a kitchen knife because we don't even have razors after the hospital.Since then, I have had an awful horrible urge to just cut again, it's like a deep evil addiction I can barely suppress, and I don't know why.I don't know what's wrong with me.I just want to all the time, and I can barely hold it back, it's always on my mind.I just need a way to get rid of this feeling without giving in again.19 days and hopefully counting
I don't know why I can't get over this but every time I do something wrong or hurt someone by mistake I want to cut myself. I don't like talking about the fact that I'm struggling not to relapse with my therapist and the last time I talked about my problems with my parents my dad mentioned having me sent to a mental hospital. Whenever I mess up I feel like I should be in some sort of pain and I usually resort to trying to cut my arms or my legs. It's happening a lot lately and I don't know at all what to do about it as I try to distract myself but it always comes back.
Im a few weeks clean now. But I think I'm going to relapse. I hate myself and who I have become and I feel like. Aiding myself pain will keep me from being this rude person and taking out all my feelings on them. I just needed to rant about it. See what you guys thought about this or if anyone can relate.

I already stopped. Stopped cutting. Threw away all my razors. I was clean for 100 days. Now I've relapsed, raised the bar, and I don't have a reason for it.Maybe I do... It's my only source of relief. Being ostracised at school, at home; having no one to care; having to do the worst possible things just to get a compliment; having to stress about everything; insecurity; anxiety that they've labeled drama... what the hell do you want me to do? Smile?I don't have the capacity to stop anymore. There's no reason to. I'm hideous with or without scars. I'm done contemplating suicide. I'm just cutting.
I can't wear my favourite watch because it rubs against a scar down my wrist.That one was 12 stitches. Its still inflammed.If I show my arms people ask questions, I have almost come to terms with that. But not being able to wear my watch has driven home just how much damage I've done. Three weeks clean now. Doesn't seem like much but it's the best I've done in a long time.
I shaved my leg in preparation to cut, and I'm just sitting here wondering why I should bother not cutting. My ex girlfriend recently just left me, and I've unfortunately had contact with my shit head, child molesting fuck face of a sperm donor. I am sitting here crying wondering why I should bother continuing this shit I call a "life".
Hey everyone, so I apologize if this is not the correct subreddit for this, please direct me otherwise if not.I really need help with the way in which I express frustration/anger. I do not get mad often, but when I do, I am like a kettle. The anger boils up and I quickly snap, often hitting/punching a wall or some other surface. After this brief rush, the anger is much more subdued. Now, the problem here is that I am a pianist/composer. I am in graduate school at NYU and intend/hope to make my career in music (I know it's hard to get into - don't want to make that a part of this discussion). I have broken my hand before by punching a wall, so much so that I had surgery and pins temporarily inserted. You'd think I'd learn my lesson after that but no, it is not that easy. It's almost a natural reaction to just swing. That being said, I've never been in a fight and would never, ever hurt some one (as long as they didn't deserve it).I'm in therapy and my therapist has suggested I seriously look into other means of expressing my anger, but it's so hard to make the switch. I know I could always hit a pillow or something (which I have tried), but I feel like there is something about the pain itself that actually relieves some of the anger.I have never been the kind of person to reach out for help like this, but I really do need help with this...my life actually depends on it! Thanks!
Re-post from r/Depression. Before venting below: I've really been wanting to find some kind of treatment center to maybe spend a couple days or casual amount of time in.  Here's the thing: I need a focus on nature.  The concept of treatment things feels like since I have no friends or people able to give me the support and love I need in my life that I have to pay people for it like someone who can't get laid paying for sex. It doesn't feel natural, I have years in residential treatment under my belt and stubbornly currently believe that the only thing that would help me heal is a loving communal environment, and connecting into the good in all things living, nature very much included and emphasized in that. I just can't get that out of anywhere sterile and white-walled. I do not trust humans at all right now, I need somewhere where nature is a strong focus. I'm located in the DC area of Maryland, but traveling to the right place may be possible. Any recommendations on where I could even begin to find somewhere that could help me and isn't sketchy or run by idiots or close minded people would be so much help, but even if you only have some place that doesn't meet what I describe but you still think could help I'm still really open to anything, somewhere run by intelligent human beings is my top priority. Issues fall under trauma, likely ptsd, childhood sexual abuse, sex addiction, not really trying to go somewhere I'll get shit for weed, but need help with drinking and substance abuse, from a place that will help me with my real problems, not get short sighted on the symptoms of them instead of what's causing things. I also have been learning about synesthesia and would really like guidance on figuring out how that and being a severe empath has been playing into my life and choices.Venting: I am a 25 year old female, I feel like something really bad is happening inside of me beyond the typical mood patterns I cycle through, depression is awful mood swings are awful I can't stop drinking at times I'm upset even while I don't like it and know I'll hate how I feel later, I've gone crazy on someone when I felt manipulated which triggered me into acting ways I haven't since I was teen and thought I outgrew, I am not talking to the people who care about me about any of these things like I should be, I used to be able to at least smoke weed to give me appetite when I'm having trouble eating or wanting to but the difficulties of it not being legal and not being able to pick the right kind is it's own problem and right now I don't even know if I should lay off smoking or find some to chill out.  I haven't had any decent weed so I haven't been sleeping much either, and when I do sleep I've been dreaming of things I really don't want to, the content of my dreams has been fucking with me too and making me subconsciously scared to sleep even though I'm so exhausted it hurts and just typing that out made me start crying again.  I want to stop wanting to self harm. My mind jumps to the urges to for control so fast these days. The suppression of it is making me act out in other ways that are negative and I'm starting to feel like fall in a category of self harm and it feels like it was so sneaky when I thought I had a hold of it maybe. This is such a ramble sorry, thanks if you read it all. If there is a more specific subreddit anyone could recommend to help my search that would also be appreciated.
I'm 18[M] and my 15[F] cut her self last night, She says she hasn't done it for about 10 months and we started dating about 7 months ago, I don't have much details all I know is she came out and said she hated herself, hated to be around people because she thought she was worthless and even went so far as to carve the word 'worthless' into her thigh I'm not sure, but I think the stress comes from her getting feelings for another guy, she says she loves me, but I'm leaving in a month and won't see her for probably 3 years. and she said to me about three weeks ago the feeling comes back then disappears and then comes back, and she doesn't know how to deal with it. I've been in relationships where stress built up, but never like this. I don't know what to do. please can someone comment or PM me about any advice I can do on my end.
After years of "clean living" I gave into the addiction that is my cutting. For eight years I never cut myself. I felt beholden to my significant other and was happy to not cut to make her happy. With my relationship falling apart, a few weeks ago I gave into it. An unrequited love for one, falling out of love with someone who I've loved for so long and dealing with the stress of all that school requires of me is all too much for me to handle.This is where I ask the question. How does anyone handle the stress of life without succuming to some sort of bad habit? Drinking, smoking, cutting or whatever else. What is the difference, really? I legitimately have no idea how anyone does it. Did I just not develope the coping mechanisms when I was a teenager to properly handle the crap around me? I'd cut myself every day if I didn't have responsibilities that require me to look good and feel confident. I recognize this is not a good habbit, but what's the difference between this bad habbit and another? How do 'normal' people handle stress? What does it matter if I wear my scars on the outside in stead of the inside? This is just as addicting to me as anything else would be to others. Over the years that I didn't cut myself, I would think about it almost every time that some stressful event came up. That's exactly what people with additiction problems feel about the things they are addicted to. The craving never goes away, you only learn to control it. What's even the point? Why would anyone care if they see the scars on my arm? Just like back then, it doesn't seem like anyone cares. I know they see it, I know they don't think it's just an accident, but they don't ever ask about how I am or even about what happened. I guess it doesn't matter. No one bothers to get close enough to try and keep me away from it anyway. If you want to stop hurting yourself take those steps to stop, but I guess I'm not at that point yet. 
So, a bit of backstory I guess, me and my girlfriend are both 17, living in the UK. It is long distance, but we're both very serious about the relationship, and although we've been together for 4 months, I've only been able to actually meet her 3 times so far.When we first began dating, she told me she was so happy that her problems with depression and self-harm almost went away completely, and I was really glad I could help her. But, in the UK at least, we have a lot of important school exams coming up, and she told me a few days ago that she had self-harmed a few times this week. She said it was due to a number of things: stress over these exams, missing me because we have to spend a lot of time studying instead of skyping, and also because she suddenly feels self-conscious about her body too?I actually have been diagnosed with depression and social anxiety too, so in some ways we are there to support each other, but it really kills me knowing that she is feeling so depressed and she is self-harming.. I'm trying hard to call her and make sure she's okay but it doesn't seem enough, she is still upset a lot of the time and I don't know what to do :/ And it doesn't help that I cannot be there physically either..Basically, I would just like to know ways of helping someone through depression and these urges to self-harm.. any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!
I'd like to start by saying, I haven't physically hurt myself for quite some time and I am fine with what I see in the mirror. I do notice, however, that eating is becoming a daily challenge and I'm starting to give up on it. When I do eat my meals are very small and the only time I ever eat any real substantial food is when I eat with others. I don't want to lose wait, I just want it feel like something more... I feel like I'm setting myself up for disappointment and I wonder why I don't enjoy this thing that is suppose to be good and most of the world enjoys.
How can I stay clean? Anyone have any advice? The other day I have myself an eraser burn. That's new for me and now that I've relapsed I can't stop having terrible urges to self harm. I see no reason to fight against it but im trying hard. 
Ok so I have no idea where to put this, but this seems like a safe bet so here goes.I just had a good female friend open up to me on cutting (if there is another terminology for it please correct me) and as a guy who's never suffered from those sorts of things I had no idea how to handle it. I talked to her about it and I couldn't find anything to say or do that could help her. I came looking for advice on how to help her through it as she told me she wants to stop, but is having trouble stopping. Any advice at all would be great..... And I'm sorry if this is against any rules of this sub. I'm just a little worried about her. 
Has anyone ever tried or considered naltrexone as a treatment for self-harm? I would be really surprised if anyone here has, not a lot of people know about this drug and prescribing for non-suicidal self injury would definitely be an off label use for it. However there's a good [body](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15611982) of [scientific](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993516/) [literature](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/child-adolescent-psychiatry/adolescent-nonsuicidal-self-injury-evaluation-and-treatment/page/0/3) in which it is used therapeutically for patients who self harm. OK, so what is Naltrexone? You can check out the wikipedia page here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaltrexoneIn a nutshell, it's a drug that acts on the opioid system in our bodies-- the same system the responds to pain killer like morphine and heroin, and it's also known as our natural endorphin system. However, instead of stimulating this system like those drugs do (or our own endogenously produced endorphins), naltrexone sits on the receptors and blocks them from becoming activated. This system is theorized to play a main role in the formation of addiction-- be it to opiates (Oxy, heroin, opium) or alcohol, or potentially any drug of addiction. It's also believed to play a role in ANY kind of addictive behavior-- overeating, compulsive gambling, and SELF HARM.The reason self harm is addictive is because (its believed) the physical damage to the body releases endorphins and these feel good molecules are soothing. The repeated release of endorphins is highly habit forming, so one gets urges to self injure whenever they feel the need to soothe themselves. Moreover, there's some evidence that the basal levels of endorphins that one has correspond to emotional sensitivity. Like, if you have higher levels of endorphins you are more emotionally resilient and recover more quickly from emotional stress. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2875354/) looks directly at the levels of endorphins in self-injurers and non-self injurers with similar psychiatric diagnosis and shows that self-injurers have lower levels of base endorphins. So there's a biological predisposition to self-injury; we are lacking sufficient amounts of a necessary neurochemical for emotional regulation and we learn to force ourselves to produce it by cutting (or burning or hitting, etc.). This looks a lot like the "self-medicating" model of drug addiction.Which brings us back to naltrexone. This drug is used to treat alcohol and opiate addiction. It works by making drugs less fun; it defeats the "soothing" effect one gets from using and over a pretty short amount of time it significantly reduces urges to drink or use. It's also used ~~off label~~* for [weight loss](http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm413896.htm) by presumably making eating less pleasurable or breaking an addiction to sugary or fatty foods. *Was recently approved by the FDA for weight-lossSo how would it work for treating self-injury? One would take a high dose every day to inhibit the opiate system. It would block the endorphin rush associated with cutting and break the neurochemical basis of addiction. That sounds unpleasant to me-- I always looked forward to having the relief that came with cutting. But for someone desperate to rid themselves of this habit this looks like a very effective tool for helping.There's another possible use; low daily dose of naltrexone. It wouldn't be enough to block the endorphins during cutting, but you would take it every day before bed in the evening to slowly trick your body into producing more basal endorphins. The low dose would block enough of your endorphin receptors at night to get your body to just produce more endorphins to maintain equilibrium. For self-injurers who already have insufficient basal endorphin levels this boost would over time improve mood and reduce urges. Here's an addiction recovery clinic that uses naltrexone this way: http://www.firemountainprograms.com/low-dose-naltrexone-for-addictionsI've never used this drug. I've actually been free of self-harm for a little over six months (yay!) with the help of therapy and prozac. I'm not gonna try naltrexone because i'm okay right now. I read about naltrexone first in an article about [alcohol addiction](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/) and wondered if it would be effective for self-injury. This post is the fruit of all my online digging. I'm insanely curious to hear if anyone has any first hand experience with this drug. It seems incredibly promising. It's cheap and seems pretty safe with low side effects. But it's also generic, so there's no marketing behind it and a lot of doctors may simply not know about it. I'd also just like to put it out there as a potential therapy. Maybe someone who isn't getting any benefit from their current psychiatric treatment could give it a shot! 
My husband and I have been having issues. He hasn't been home since Thursday of last week. It has been hard. And last night while I was speaking to him I got so worked up that I dug scissors into my skin and just kept digging. I am so mad at myself for allowing it to happen and letting my husband's actions make me break down and do this. Not that I am blaming him, but I hadn't done it in over a year and a half. And the sad truth is, it felt so good. 
Over the past couple weeks I've happened upon scars from a few sessions that I thought hadn't resulted in scarring.
It hurts, but it feels so good at the same time. And I hate myself for it, I hate myself and I hate that watching me bleed makes me feel alive.
My sister and I never got along, given the huge age gap between us we never really had anything in common, I was a complete jackass to her most of our childhood. For the last year or so I've been trying my damndest to make up for my past sins.I have struggled with depression my whole life, I was on the verge of suicide but I always thought that If I was going to hurt myself, I would just go all the way at once. The point is, I have no experience with self harm and the mentality behind it, or how I can go about helping her through this.What can I do to help my baby sister, reddit?
I am thankful that I set up an appointment to see a therapist. I opened up with her today about how I am feeling/thinking, more so than usual, and she gave me reassurance and some really helpful tools to read through and try out. I came home after and instead of being extremely upset at myself for telling her something or not telling her something, I read through the materials she gave me then I turned on some music and did some Pilates stretches (I love Pilates but can rarely convince myself to do it). I actually felt some relief from my anxiety and it was such a needed relief. My anxiety is already returning as I have to work tonight, but at least I got some relief in a healthy way for a short while. I don’t know why I am sharing, just wanted to share this accomplishment with you all I guess. I am so thankful for this community and for this supportive environment. Hope everyone is doing well. <3
I've resisted the urge to cut for over 8 years for the most part (with a few slip ups but nothing that resulted in bleeding except for breaking some skin from a rubber band) and I am afraid of relapsing. The only thing that stopped me was because I didn't like the look of scars and they reminded me of the emotional pain that I hoped would go away, and I've been doing so good I can barely notice the scars I made when I was younger. However for so long, definitely weekly, I've still had that urge. I'm kind of thinking now like, who the heck is going to see some of the scars? I don't go to the beach, I can't really have children (unless some scientific miracle happens that hasn't been invented yet - I'm not going to adopt) so I'd feel bad for taking someone else out of the gene pool (I'm kind of done dating to be honest like what is the point), I almost always wear t-shirts or longer so like.... idk I'm just slowly losing my only reason to not cut myself but I feel like I should get more perspective before I make a potentially regrettable decision. I don't want to go to my university counselor. I'm afraid I will just get kicked out or something because they don't do anything unless there is harm that could happen. Then if I do say I'm thinking of self harming again then what will they do?Edit: I don't like the sound the rubber band makes I like to be quieter, and I try to live in a very environmentally friendly way so I don't own a fridge/ freezer voluntarily so I can't really do the ice cube thing either. I don't want to waste money on a bag of ice that is just going to melt only for doing the ice cube thing.
just if anyone wants to talk, I wouldn't mind some conversation, venting, idk 
I just want someone to talk to. I've never really had friends and depression and anxiety have caused my to start cutting myself. I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. My parents don't know what to do. I've been to the hospital multiple times but it never helps. I just want to stop cutting and just have at least one "friend" to talk to.
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm not going to be be able to outright tell my therapist that I started to self cut. Is their an easier why for me to tell him than just "I cut myself this and last week" any insight would be great thanks
I've been self harming for a few years now, but only been cutting for the last 4 or so months. I told myself I was going to stop but it's just too hard. If I don't cut then I can't sleep and if I can't sleep then the thoughts just pile up and get worse. How can I get out of this cycle of just pure shit feelings
I scratch myself. With safety pins and other things. Sometimes enough to bleed. I like it when the marks last for a couple of days but don't leave a lasting scar. I'm doing it more frequently and I want to start seriously cutting myself.What will happen to me if I confess this to my therapist?
I haven't cut in over 7 months. However, I'm seriously considering starting again or worse just slitting myself so deep that I die. I hate the pain, I hate the blade, but it's my only form of release from this unfair and unjust world.
I have struggled with depression and self-harm since I was a sophomore in high school. Now a sophomore in college, I have been hospitalized once (almost twice), I have been more than 6 months clean of cutting and blew it, and I have been really happy and really sad. I have been dumped, cheated on, raped, had my best friends leave me, found someone I truly loved, lost it due to depression, and have tried to take my own life. I am at a point where I am sick of being judged for taking medication. I am sick of trying to let people in who just leave me. I don't think I am strong enough to get better anymore. Anytime I try to get better, everything just gets a hundred times worse. In the past month I have never been more than three days clean. I just feel so lost and alone, that no one understands me or even cares, I hate being told that I don't look like the type of person who is depressed or who cuts. Yes I do have a preppy personality but that doesn't mean I don't cry myself to sleep most nights. I just can't do taking medications to make me feel numb anymore. Sleeping pills to get to bed without crying. Having my medications cranked up to a point where I feel like a zombie, or a therapist who just doesn't get it. I feel like I even have to pretend to be around her. She'd much rather talk about how a big event was rather than the fact afterwards I cried and thought about cutting. I just don't know what to do anymore, I lose everyone. I rely on cutting to feel better. I basically am around people 24/7 yet I feel that no one is really there. I just see all these happy people and get so frustrated why I can't be like them. I am to a point where I can barely fake a smile anymore. I am very sorry for the rant, I just don't know what to do anymore. 
Last night I dreamt about self harming in the summer of this year. It was when my boyfriend went to American Music Aboard and I don't know. I'm scared that I'll actually self harm when I have been clean for months. I don't know what I should do. I had a panic attack when I woke up. I just don't know.
Sometimes, the only thing that stops me from self harming is what my boyfriend would say when he sees and the guilt I would have from him seeing.  What's the thing that stops you?
I haven't hurt myself since the end of December. At that point I had lost a lot and been hurt deeply emotionally, and it was a form of release. Since then, my life had been somewhat improving, and my tolerance to deal with it has been beginning to increase. I have done it as a way to calm me down and make me feel better when I was incredibly mad at myself. And it worked. Then the other night I got blackout drunk and began making out with a girl. This was all fine, except up until that point in the night, I was an antisocial bastard because I was trying to avoid my next anxiety attack (I had one earlier that night because I was in a social situation I was extremely uncomfortable in). Everything about the night was horrible. And then we were back at a friend's house and everyone was drinking and making out. Another reason this is an issue is because I'm still in love with my ex, and although she has a boyfriend, she's unhappy about this hook up. The topper to this whole fucked up situation is that while blackout drunk I became exactly the kind of person I loathe and have been in a number of fights with. The guy who is going to far with the girl instead of enjoying himself. I was so drunk I moved into a state where I thought I was with said ex and began behaving as if it was her, which was way more forceful then was acceptable. I hurt her emotionally, I know that, even though we haven't spoken since, and I hurt the person I'm in love with it because of it. I can't do anything except sit still, overthink every moment I can't remember, want to vomit, and want to hurt myself. It's the only way I know how to deal with this kind of pain. I'm so sorry and I can't believe I became this person. It's killing me, and I think the only ways I know will work are hurting myself and finally stepping in front of the train like I've been wanting to for years. Please help me, I feel like the scum of the fucking earth. 
I no longer self-harm, but I wanted to post my story here, in hopes that it'll help those who are in similar situations. I have changed the names of everyone involved, out of respect and for their privacy. My story begins on Friday, July 30, 2014. I worked in a small call center. It had maybe 30 people working there, all temps. Above the temps were my 2 supervisors (Brenda and Larry), and their supervisor (June). That morning I had arrived at work at 7:30. My shift normally started at 8:30, when the phones went live, however, Brenda had requested I come in for an hour of overtime to catch up on paperwork. It had been a particulary rough week, as 5 people were off every day. I worked until about 8:20, when I got up and fixed myself another cup of coffee. I had walked my cup of coffee back to my desk when my friend, Mary, walked into the office. Now, before I can continue, I feel that you need to know a little bit about Mary. She's the type of person who would meet you and talk to you like she'd known you her whole life, and you and her were best friends. I heard so many stories from her and my coworkers. She once told me that her grandson didn't want to come with her on errands because she'd strike up deep conversations with whomever she'd run into; be it the cashier at the grocery store or the woman handing food out the drive-thru window. She would ask them about their days, and if there was anything she could pray about for them. A week later, she would show up again and ask how things were. Her daughter later had told me about another time, when a waitress had been snippy with her table, and how by the end of their conversation, the waitress and Mary were hugging and in tears, and the waitress was thanking Mary for lending an ear when no one else would.  To sum it up, she genuinely cared about everyone, and never took "fine" for an answer when she asked how your day was going. When I first met Mary, she was carrying bags and boxes. Mary was 60 years old, 300+lbs, and needed a cane to walk. I saw her struggling at the front door with those items, and her water bottle, which was precariously wrapped around her pinky, her trying not to spill it. Being a decent human being, I immediately dropped what I was doing and took the bags and boxes for her, so all she had to carry was her drink. She still walked very slow, being her age and weight. I helped her to her desk and placed everything where it belonged, and told her it was very nice to meet her. For the rest of the day and the next couple days, she showered me with praise. I brushed it all off, telling her it was no big deal, and that any person who was slightly nice would've done the same thing. I was taken aback with her friendliness.So back to the day it all began: Mary seemed a little out of breath, which didn't come as a surprise to me. she suffered from a heart condition and was out with pneumonia the last 4 days. She had told me a week before that her doctor said if the pneumonia got any worse she'd have to be put on heart medication. She still smiled at me and exclaimed how happy she was to see me, as well as everyone else in the office. Five minutes later, I heard a commotion. I looked around the corner and saw my coworkers, wide eyed and pale. I asked what was wrong to a woman who had walked towards me when I looked around the corner who said that Mary was having trouble breathing. I immediately walked to the end of the cubicle row, and I offered that I was CPR certified and that I could help her. I was hushed back to my desk by Brenda, and told that the phones would go live soon. Reluctant to leave my friend in distress, I walked back to my desk. The first call of the day came in at 8:30. No sooner had I greeted the caller than I heard screaming. I heard someone scream my name. I explained to the customer that there was an emergency. I put him on hold immediately. I hurried over to Mary, and saw her slumped in her chair. She had just lost consciousness and was sliding out of the chair to the ground. June was right behind me. June and I took turns giving her CPR. It continued for about 10 minutes, until the ambulance had arrived. Later, I would be told that she had suffered from a "widow maker" heart attack, and had she been in the hands of a cardiologist instead of mine, she still would have perished. I watched the EMTs work on her. Someone told me to go back to my desk. I barely remember who it was. I numbly resumed the call with the irritated customer who had been put on hold for 10 minutes. I didn't blame the customer, he had no idea as to what had happened. When I had finished I turned my desk phone off so I wouldn't get more calls. June asked me if I wanted to go home, and at that point I broke down and, sobbing, I thanked her and left. I spoke with my husband on the phone, who was at his job, and explained everything. He couldn't do much except sympathize and told me to not worry about anything right now except myself. The next 5 days were a blur. I was hysterical. I had never seen a person die before, and the fact that it was this woman who was like a grandomther to me after only 4 months of knowing her, made it all the worse. I drank heavily. Larry had been on vacation that week, and came back to the news. We all attended grief counseling set up by the company, but that did very little for me. Eventually I went to see my regular therapist, who was able to finally bring me down from hysterical crying. The next week after, I started having panic attacks and nightmares. Larry would take me into his office and close the door, trying to comfort me and get me out of the office's eye. Everyone told me I was a hero, and that I should be proud of myself for stepping up and doing what no one else did, instead of being a bystander. To this day I still say they're wrong. A hero would've saved her. A hero would be stronger than this. My husband tried to comfort me, but he and I both knew that he had no experience like mine, and couldn't relate. My crying sessions with Larry were fewer, and I began to improve in my workload in early September. I still talked with Larry on a regular basis through IM. He seemed to understand how I felt. Now, at this point, I'll admit that I had considered Larry very attractive from my first day on the job, but had never taken it further than friendly conversation. Later on in the month, however, things took a turn for the worse. I fell ill. I would wake every morning and immediately run to the bathroom and throw up. I couldn't keep much of anything down, save clear broth soup and one or two crackers every day. I had constant chest pains, though they were at their worst in the mornings. I believed, at some point, that I was going to die. I had no insurance at the time, and was already paying off a hospital bill from 2 years ago for an emergency room visit which turned out to be nothing. I did my best to keep working and moving on. I lost a total of 50 lbs in about 3 months from being so sick. Larry knew I was sick every day, and everyone could see the weight loss, but I don't think anyone was aware how sick I felt. Larry knew about my problems, and he provided a great shoulder to cry on, as my husband worked very long hours. Eventually, and this is a horrible decision, I know, but Larry coaxed out of me how I found him attractive for the past year and a half I had worked with him. I was so embarrassed but relieved when I found out he liked me too. Well, on that same night I got more drunk than normal and I texted him some pretty graphic things. The next day he pulled me into his office and kissed me. Over the next week I started feeling almost euphoric. I started to believe that I was going to survive. I stopped feeling so sick and started having one small meal a day. It was still so little that I was losing weight, but I looked overall pretty happy. Larry and I met after work at this baseball field's parking lot near our job, and we just talked and kissed. There was obviously some sexual conversation going on between us, but it never escalated further than that.A few weeks later (this happened in October) June called me into her office and told me that she knew about what was going on between Larry and I. She clamly told me that I could keep my job but I had to stop all contact with Larry, and I would now be reporting to her from now on. I spent the next week having breakdowns. I moved my desk, as before it was right next to his office. I tried not to look at him at all, as that would send me into another crying fit. It was at that point I began scratching myself with knives. One of my work buddies had discovered the scratches and kept a close eye on me, but I just went further into my shell and wore clothing that covered everything, since it was getting into the colder months anyways. Three weeks after my meeting with June, I recieved a message from Larry. I felt my heart flutter. He apologized for what happened. I apolgized too. We started talking regularly over IM, but never gave a hint of any contact in public.  It helped a little, but I still felt pretty miserable. I kept drinking heavily and made more and more scratches on my arm. This continued until late at night on Saturday, December 6th. My husband went through my phone while I was sleeping and confronted me about the conversations I was having. He and I fought, but it never became anything physcial. After that, we kept our distance from each other. Monday morning, December 8th, I drove to work and arrived early. I sat in the parking lot, alone with my thoughts. I began to think "I can't work like this." I felt so depressed I just didn't want to be around any of it. I just wanted to escape. I went home and started drinking heavily. Larry messaged me asking what was going on. Some of my coworkers had seen me drive out of the parking lot before I had called off work "sick." I told him I was NOT ok. Around noon, he called me. I was drunk and had a lot of fresh cuts on me, but I was still crying. It was easy at that point to see that I was suicidal. I'll spare you the rest of the details, but at the last second, I stopped my attempt and drove to my husband's boss's house and waited for him to get home. I told him about my attempt. We agreed at that point that I should go to the hospital. Tuesday morning I was admitted to a psychiatric institute. My stay at the hospital was the best and worst thing to ever happen to me. I learned from the 2 weeks that I was there that there are people out there a lot worse off than me, but it was also very scary at times to have to be sat next to people who were not so sane. Also, during that time, my husband had my phone and did further digging and he found that Larry and I had met outside of work. He told me that I could either divorce him, or I would have to leave my job. I immediately called and tearfully resigned my job. The next day I was released from the hospital. I felt miserable. I felt like all the progress I had made in the hospital had just vanished. I was on these drugs which made me irritable, I snapped at everything my husband said. He grilled me about everything I did. I needed to explain my motives behind getting up and walking to the kitchen, and was chastized for not telling him that I wanted to do that before I got up. I didn't leave the house. It was at that point, I graduated to full-on cutting. Months went by, things got slowly better, but we were still sinking financially. The last rent payment we made was a partial payment in December. We started getting calls from the rental agency for rent. I looked for a job, but was having trouble finding anything. He worked, but didn't make enough to feed us and pay rent. I weaned myself off the medication, which was an incredibly stupid idea, but I really had no choice at that point. Eventually, I was allowed to leave the house. My husband complained about not liking it and not knowing where I was. I gave him my apple ID and password so he could track my location through iCloud. This was benefical and harmful at the same time. He made comments about all my routes. We argued about that after a while, I got tired of feeling spied on and grilled about everywhere I was. He agreed to delete the tracker from his phone. The fights became more frequent. Eventually around May we recieved an order from the MDJ to pay rent or an order for eviction would be issued. I still hadn't found a job. He got a purge order for child support, around $2,000, the same amount as the back rent due. At that time, I saw my family doctor. My mother put me on her insurance for the time being (I'm 23 and the law says I can be on her insurance until I'm 26, even if I'm married). I first started with getting rid of the self-harm. The best coping mechanism I discovered has 2 steps: 1) make a list of reasons NOT to cut. I came up with 72 reasons. 2) Whenever you get the urge, write a few of those reasons over where you want to self-harm. (If you are still reading this, god bless you. I promise my story is almost through. Please let me know if you'd like to see my list of reasons if you want inspiration for your own) Ever since I have taken this up, I have not self-harmed.Then, my husband and I set up an appointment for free couples therapy, which we are still attending to this day. We collectively agree that things are 90% better in terms of our relationship. Sadly, this was not enough to get us out of the financial hole we were in. On Easter Sunday, we were evicted from our home. But this is where things really turned around. That friday, I recieved a call from an interview I thought I had completely bombed. They wanted to hire me! I start tomorrow. I will be making more than I've made at any other job before. Also, in that same weekend, my husband and I came across a great deal in a trailer park where they'll give us the trailer as our property for $1. They will give us 2 months free rent and $1500 to rehab the trailer, as it has been abandoned for a few years. The only conditions are that we agree to live in the park for 3 years, and that we rehab the trailer to make their community look a little nicer. Currently, we are waiting on the background check to complete before we can begin work on our new home (they don't allow felons) and we are staying at my in-laws' house. This past week has really been a miracle after all the rough things that were thrown at my husband and I, but we're finally getting through it. 
Because I've run almost every morning this week and again would have been a bad idea and hurtful to my body.


I'm a junior in highschool. Life has been really against me lately. This all starts where me and my best friend of 4 years decided to start dating and she made me so happy and then she broke up with me and never told me why and I feel really depressed about it that was a month ago. (Still feel depressed) then I was going to go to acting state competition but my closest friend Chris told a teacher I was sneaking drugs into state. (I was not I don't do drugs) he also told my other good friend Dave that I was trying to hook up with his ex (they broke up a week ago) and me and her are really good friends and I would never try to do anything like that. Well I was able to go to state which is where I am at the moment but everyone that my friend Chris told went to state and everyone hates me and I kinda want to just leave I'm a lone wolf here. And I just feel like I want to kill myself at the moment. And my ex girlfriend is here to and she is having the time of her life with everyone else while I'm dying here and I just recently got kicked out of my moms house and have been staying with friends so there is know way for me to leave at all and I just want to cry and blow my brains out..please help.
The person I was dating lost interest in me, of course. We only had sex once, but he saw my self harm scars and I feel like that was a deal breaker for him. Actually, the way I responded was probably a deal breaker for him. "Oh, that's just the past" *mumbles and darts eyes anxiously*--yeah that was most likely it. I feel like my facial expressions and mannerisms were uncontrollable but forced--as if I wanted him to know. Know what exactly? I don't know. I'm sure I wanted him to read me in a sabotaging light, since I often feel like I shouldn't be loved at all. Maybe he wasn't used to seeing brown skin so scarred up. Also, I always over analyzing everything I do because the fact of the matter is that I feel like a failure, thus should be punished. Wow. I haven't self harmed in over a year and half, but today, oooh today, that last session felt like it happened yesterday. Something about "today" triggered me. Gosh, I wish things didn't have to trigger me. I get it: I have control over my thoughts; I have the power to change the negative self-talk tape in my head. It's just that whenever I give myself, this bleh body, share a bit of my personality with someone romantically or otherwise, I get ashamed. Maybe the guy I was dating could see the shame, since he got close enough to result in putting my guard down. I don't even let my guard down with my siblings or parents. Tonight is the night that I have a clear view of my arts-n-crafts x-acto knife, but for hopeful reasons, I'm reaching out to this subreddit because people tend to have interesting perspectives on matters like these. Typing this out made me feel a bit better. 
Hi there. I'm a 27 yo female and I started cutting two months ago. Are there any other adults out there that started self harm beyond their teenage years? I'm progressing quickly, went from a kitchen knife to the x-acto just this evening. God is it effective! Also increased frequency to several times a week. I need to stop, and want to stop but it's just so impulsive. I don't even think about how stupid it is before I do it. Please help me before I do something worse.  
I have several mental illnesses, and im a hormonal teenager. PERFECT STORM. I started cutting about a month ago. It all started innocently enough when I was taking a bath, and I fell asleep. Woke up pruney as hell and was very itchy and cold. It was like 3 AM, and I saw one of my knives (im a collector) sitting on the bathroom counter, and I thought to myself "Well I bet if I just nick myself it will take my mind off of it". So I made a little nick on my arm (barely even bled), and it took my mind off the itchy/prunieness feeling. The next day I felt an urge to cut again, and I gave in. I have cut myself probably around 75-150 times. I usually cut on the side of my legs because it was a good angle for me. Well I fell asleep on the couch one day, and my pants rolled up while i tossed around in my sleep, and my mom saw. Obviously upset we talked. I was clean for a whole month. I was so goddamn proud of myself. But about 2 days ago I had a few beers, and was feeling sad for myself. Smashed a beer bottle, cleaned it out, and tore up my legs. about 10 cuts or so, and one of them is the length of like 3 normal size cuts. I was upset, but blew it off as a drunken relapse, but tonight laying in bed. I just felt terrible. Worthless. Useless. Just really horribly depressed. It was 4am, and said I would just pull an all nighter. Looking around in my desk for an adderall, but I found an old knife first...and destroyed my feet. I tied a belt around my foot, and intentionally tried to hit a vein. Not to kill myself I just wanted to see the blood spurt out of my body. I didn't hit a vein, but I did make about 7 really deep cuts, and now I just feel worse.I can't fucking sleep because im out of sleeping pills (have major insomnia) im all out of fucking adderall so I doubt ill get much done in alternative school today. Will probably have to spend another goddamn month there, because the deadline is may 26. Will probably be there until june 30th or so. Surrounded by druggies, and "gangsters". Luckily I look the part though, and wear a jacket that has money all over it so people don't fuck with me, but they pat us down at the door, and make us take our socks off. My teacher definetly noticed, and I know other people did too, and now I have a great new fresh one to show off at school this morning! yay! I fucking need to be put in a psych ward. I really need to be. Every fiber of my being tells me not to because im afraid of going, but I know I need it. Im thinking of asking my mom to commit me. God I dont know what the fuck to do. Im in alternative school, and they do random drug tests so I cant smoke pot so all I have to take the edge off everyday life is my vaporizer, and the occasional beer. Not everything in my life is horrible though. I have great parents. Me and my stepdad have always been pretty distant, but weve been watching scary movies, and hanging out. So at least me and my stepdad are finally getting along after like 10 years. My mother is great, and I want to tell her I relapsed so bad. I have to tell someone, but I fucking can't keep dumping this shit on her. I told her I relapsed once and she just had the most dissapointed look on her face, and she was so sad, and she has money problems, and I just can't put more stress on her. she says i can talk to her and tell her anything, and I can I just don't want to stress my mom out because i love her so much. Ive been up for 20 hours now, and a few days ago I was up for 36 hours. What the fuck is wrong with me. Who the fuck stays up for 36 hours straight. sleeps for 8 hours, and then stays up for another 20 hours. I wont fall asleep until tonight so basically Ive been up for 2 days straight with 1 8 hour break. Who the fuck does shit like this? Did someone put motherfucking meth in my drink??? Sorry for the wall of text I just have to get this out of my goddamn system.
I haven't seriously cut in two years, but I'll be damned if I don't start again tonight. Fuck.I need a cigarette, or I need a knife. One of those, I can't get ahold of.
The person I am in love with has depression, anxiety and an ED.Before I met him and started dating him, he would self harm and his arms and legs are littered with scars. He also starved himself because he believed that he was overweight, despite wearing probably 10kg less than he should be. He wasn't able to order his own food at subway and he had difficulty at his workplace because part of his job involved talking to customers.I'd like to say that I've helped him. In the almost-year that we were dating, he didn't put a blade to his skin once (he thought about it but decided against it), he gained weight and I helped him face his anxiety and he now feels more comfortable ordering his own food and so on. He also came home from work often telling me stories about how he helped this customer or how this customer was annoying, etc etc. Which means he's talking, yes!!!The depression still had a pretty bad effect on him. There were often nights where he just wouldn't be able to control himself and all of these horrible emotions and thoughts would come pouring out of him. It was very hard to watch, and I started to run out of ways to cheer him up. It was very frustrating for me and I'm a very impatient person. I talked to his friends about it, and they helped me encourage him to go to a doctor and talk about anti depressants. He got some, but didn't start taking them because the side effects made him uncomfortable. It's ironic how suicidal thoughts is a side effect of anti depressants.About a month and a bit ago, he started to take them. All was well until about two weeks in, when he would constantly mention feeling 'weird', 'funny' or 'tingly in the inside'. Then it started to get really bad. All of the stuff I'd see before and called "bad" was nothing compared to how much of a wreck he became. And it took a pretty bad toll on me, and we started to fight (or at least I got overly emotional about stupid things that he did to make himself feel better and I was basically a cunt to him. I feel terrible about it all now and I wish I wasn't so selfish). We went on a break, came back off it, went on a break again, broke up, got back together, broke up again.. it's all very stressful for both of us, but he's the one who's really suffering.He started to self harm again. He came over today and pretty much confessed it to me, and then he lifted up his shirt and showed me. He's got a total of 24 cuts spread out over his left arm, his chest, ribs and his hips. And I don't know what to do. I've never been confronted by a situation like this. I've never seen fresh cuts before, I've only ever traced my fingers over his smooth and lightly scarred arms. And to be honest, it's freaking me the fuck out. It put me in a bit of shock for a couple of hours (and by then he'd left to go be with friends) but now I just want to help. I've put all the stupid relationship problems and all my petty emotions behind me because all I want to do is make sure those damn things heal. It was a real wake up call for me that he really needs help, and he needs me to be there for me. So yeah. I need help. I need advice. How do I help him? How do I stop this from happening? I know that's really broad but I really have no idea. I feel so desperate for advice, help, anything.His parents know about his depression but not about the self harming at all (not even from before). He's been to counselors before but they've literally forgotten about him. He talked to his counselor outside of appointment times and they said "who are you?" and he gave up on them after that.Please, just any advice would be nice. Knowing how to treat his cuts in case they get bad and he doesn't take care of them or let them heal. Knowing what to say and what not to say to make him feel better. I don't know. Anything.
I finally set up my first appointment with a therapist. Obviously I'm freaking out. My first instinct is to be so mad at myself, why would I do something so stupid, talk to someone I mean, why will they care or help? I want to cancel so bad. But something deep down is keeping me from cancelling. So instead I am researching, and have been for a really long time, what the first session is like. Not sure if this is the best idea because now I am starting to panic. I know the first session is a "get to know you" time and can be a lot of paperwork and personal questions. I am not good at get to know you questions. I know what my answers will be for like my work, my relationship/family. I'm not sure at all how to answer other personal questions like drug/alcohol use, self-harm, feelings. Those are things I have never told anyone. It's none of her business and why would she even ask. But then I remind myself, she's a therapist, she has to ask, this is why you are here. Ugh stupid anxiety. If you sought therapy, how honest were you during the first session with your therapist? Did you answer all of the questions? Or did you save some things for future sessions? I just don't know if I am actually committed to this and telling her everything makes it seem like I am committing. Not sure what to do. 
I used to think self harm was so stupid but I've found myself relapsing again and again. Especially today. My wrist looks terrible and so do my thighs. I don't know how to handle it. I feel alone in this. I'm tired of fighting myself.What can I even do anymore?
I relapsed last week after about 3 months of doing really well. Now I'm back to wondering how I'm going to make it through each night without hurting myself. I tried to call my university's on call counselor the night I relapsed, and they pretty much blew me off and made things worse rather than better. The few friends I have are really distant lately. I finally opened up about it in my group therapy today and they just really didn't seem to get it. Now just about everyone I know has gone home for Easter and I'm alone in my apartment, depressed, lonely, and bored, just trying figure out how I'm going to get through the next three days. 
  Just like with my last post, I am going to be posting a serious of things to do instead of self harming because there is so much out there!![For Anxiety reasons I suggest a Calm Jar](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Calming-Glitter-Jars/)[The Sirius Project Has Incrediblely Helpful Guide on What To Do Based On What You're Feeling](http://sirius-project.org/2011/08/16/distractions-and-alternatives-to-self-harm/)[Just Vent, or Mutter, Is An Anonymous Open Place Where You Can Submit Stuff So You Can Vent](http://www.muttr.com/)[BlahTherapy Was Suggested To Me When I Stopped Going To Therapy By My Therapist.

So I have been clean from self harm for about 6 and a half months now. However, I still have some fairly visable scars on my arm and thighs. I am extremely self concious about them, and summer is coming up quickly, and I need advice on fading the scars. Anything helps. Thanks :)
i work in a little mall at one of those open booths that sell things like purses and scarves. today i found out the assistant manager position i have been working towards for 10 months (long, different rant altogether) is being given to our new hire; that was at the shift start, so it set a pretty crummy mood for the work day. After 3pm I work by myself for the rest of the day. I just tried to pep along until about a half hour after my coworker left, an old woman began to bitch at our eco-bag policy. We charge for shopping bags and the money goes to a children's charity. Think what you will of it, but I the lowly cashier have no say over the policy. Regardless she buys her purse but then comes back to the til and starts complaining about the bags again. I explained the policy politely to her, where the money goes, why the company doesn't use plastic. She doesn't care and yells the same spiel that she shouldn't have to pay for a bag to carry her purchases. I apologize and restate I cannot change the policy. I even gave her a contact card for head office so she could tell them her juicy little opinions. Not good enough. She points a finger towards the till.Me, already being upset about today, and now this woman starts tells me how unethical we were for stealing her donation. wut? Confused I ask her what she means. Then she pointed at me and passive aggressively accused staff of pocketing the money. I fucking lost it. And by lost it, I mean I took off my 'customer service' face and put on my 'this shit is done' face and said 'Thats it, I don't want to hear it anymore. HO makes the policy and I follow it or lose my job. I'm sick of hearing the complaining from you and other customers, I can't do a thing about it, contact Manager at [revomit all the info on the card]. I'll even write MY name on the back so you know exactly who to place your complaint against'. She was speechless for a moment then told me she didn't like my bad attitude and wanted to return the bag NOW. I told her she should wait until tomorrow then she can talk to my manager, lodge her complaint, get the refund and probably a giftcard too, and be done with me (at this point my anger is gone and the panic is setting in at realizing what I just said, so I'm just trying to get her away asap before the full panic attack starts). Nope, she wants it refunded. Fine, rang it up, remained shaking & silent the entire time except to ask what her street name was because her handwriting was worse than a doctor suffering parkisons, then gave her the cash/receipt. Thankfully she just left and chose not to rip into me more. I started crying, rang up the next person in line, then tucked myself into a corner and began to just slash at myself with a pair of scissors from the till. Pretty sure both a customer and my co-worker who was still walking in the mall saw my arms later, and there is no way that the staff across the way didn't hear me crying so my boss will find out about my meltdown.So that was my great day :( I have highly visible thin red cuts from my wrist to elbow that I need to cover and hide. I'm fucking terrified I am going to loose my job because of what happened today, or that I am going to be sent to the hospital because it was in the middle of a public place and the security cameras maybe saw. I'm paranoid as shit. My boyfriend is going to be so hurt and upset when he sees the cuts, the thought alone is making me cry and feel ashamed all over again. I've been trying so hard to stop. It was going really well and I had been clean for months despite how hard the finances have been and now this. I just couldn't stop today. It was too much. Even having ativan before the shift and another after finding out about the lost position wasn't enough to help me keep my cool. It's like one too many things and I snap. I can't lose my job we are in debt already and are trying to sell the house... its all making me want to hurt myself again. I can't cut again but I want to so badly, because I'm just so full of the guilt and shame and fear. 
I have a hard time coping and dealing. I understand this. I know this. I should probably get some help. I did go to see a psychiatrist a few times, but it was only temporary. He suggested I get a long-term therapist. That would probably be good, but I don't have the time for that.I also know that seeing someone won't magically solve everything. I used to think that before, that once I got a shrink everything would solve itself. I now know that it's not like that. So I try to focus on the good things and maybe I'll get some help once I've settled down, but right now won't work.I'm sad right now, but it will be better in a while. Sharing randomness to get my mind of stuff. I don't know what I want.
Hi Reddit, recovering cutter here (still very new to the recovery part: 11 days now). I want to dispose of my cutting stuff to remove temptation, but I don't know how to dispose of it without me wanting to go back and get it later. Any suggestions? 
I realized tonight I'll probably always self harm. I've been doing it for eight years. I always regret it the day or two after, but I still have the urge every time I'm sad. And lately I've always been sad, and I don't have the energy to fight off that urge anymore. Cutting calms me down, makes me feel less crazy and alone. I don't know why I'm so upset tonight. It's complicated and I don't understand it. But I know self harm will make me feel better. I have no idea what else could
So, I've been slightly over a month clean free from cutting. The cuts/scars are now just blemishes but they're noticeable especially since I still have my pale "winter" skin colour. Yesterday, I decided to go workout in shorts and a tank top, and the weather was very lovely and warm but I had some dread feeling of self-consciousness about my scars. Then I thought, well no one is going to look directly at it the first time they see me, and if my friends sees it and questions about it, I'll be honest about it. So, I went outside and had fun with my friends and went to workout and for the longest of times of being ashamed about my scars, I gave zero fucks and acted like I was a complete normal human being. :) The hardest part for me now is to keep fighting off my urges to cut. And I want to so badly but I know that I can do it. *mini-victory dance*
  The main reason why I'll be posting and talking about a lot of this is because, honesty, it is stopping me from self harming right now and focusing on the minor aspects of it is what got me a year away from it so I plan to do it again for my boyfriend. I do apologize for my grammatical and spelling errors ahead but I am trying my best to make none.I bring this post up to attention hopefully because as much as it is painful to not just go into a private browser, so no one sees your history, and just Google how to stop and deal with the urges there's still that part that will want to continue it forever and ever. And, no, I don't mean that sarcastically or make anyone mad as I dealt with this and couldn't bring myself to do it either, so here are some things you can do!   Firstly, when you google even "stop self harm" it shows a small table. It says;                 If self-harm helps, why stop?                 Although self-harm and cutting can give you temporary relief, it comes at a cost. ...                 The relief is short lived, and is quickly followed by           other feelings like shame and guilt. ...                 Keeping the secret from friends and family members is difficult and lonely.Below, it shows links on how to stop and different aide sites if you know someone who needs help. Some of the sites include adolescentselfinjuryfoundation, which has a "46 Things To Do Besides Self Harm", and thesite, which has "Dealing with urges to self-harm".   Some excellent Tumblr accounts are even out there to help, such as; Stopselfharm, Butterfly-project (a personal favourite), Help-is-here (UK based), Nomore-selfharm (very simple but very helpful), and You-can-recover (their most popular post should be /caringforselfharmwounds but I digress I just worry for someone who doesn't know how to care for their wounds). -- [The Quiet Place Also Helps A Lot](http://thequietplaceproject.com/thequietplace)[For Those Who Like To Write To Forget TreeStory Is Made By The Same Person](http://treestory.me/feed)[Calm Has Asmr-Like Meditation Which Is Relaxing and Distracting](http://www.calm.com/)[WeaveSilk Is a Beautiful Image Making Site That Allows You To Use Different Coloured Silks](http://weavesilk.com/)[Much Like WeaveSilk But WIth Nebulas](http://29a.ch/sandbox/2011/neonflames/)[THIS WEBSITE LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE MULTIPLE TIMES.

None of my healthy coping techniques are working and I'm spiraling fast. It feels like it's been so long since I've felt relief. I really need something and I don't want it to be this but I'm getting more desperate as time goes by. I am just so overwhelmed... And I really like the anticipation of hurting myself tonight.
I am 24 years old, and have been suffering from severe mental illness for nearly a decade now. My primary diagnosis is Bipolar I (Treatment-Resistant, Predominantly Depressive), and I also suffer from severe Borderline Personality Disorder, and acute, crippling Anxiety. Up until the past 8 months or so, I have never engaged in self-harm in any of its forms. Over the past few months, I found myself facing some very difficult hardships, and in December, for the first time in my life, I cut. I had never personally felt compelled to self-harm, though I have always understood why others who are suffering could feel compelled engage in self-harm practices (My heart goes out to anyone out there reading this who is also hurting, or has a loved one who is struggling. I believe that we are all deserving of happiness, good health, and stability...and while I recognize that we may not be able to achieve these things immediately, in the meantime, I can offer you my sincerest kindness, compassion, and empathy.)I attempted to cut a few more times after that, but I found that I was unable to ever truly go through with it. The only evidence that remains is few faint scratches, and I am fairly confident that I will never attempt to cut again. Unfortunately, I failed to recognize the fact that I have actually been engaging in a different form of self-harm since early Summer 2014, although it is possible that it has been going on for longer than that and I have been in denial. Without divulging any graphic or potentially triggering details, my form of self-harm is self-inflicted head trauma, and since October of last year, I suspect that I have given myself at least three concussions based on my symptoms, although only one occasion was so severe that my pupils became so disproportionately large that my iris appeared almost completely black. I do not know how many times I've engaged in this form of self-harm, and I only became aware of it after seeing my former S.O. strike themselves in the head repeatedly during a tense episode. It was terrifying to witness, and it brought me to tears. I pleaded them to stop, and asked what prompted this behavior. My former S.O. simply looked at me in shock, and said "I learned it from you." While I was dumbfounded by this information, and had no recollection of engaging in anything like this, but to this day, I believe wholeheartedly that my former S.O.'s assertions were true, and that perhaps I have been engaging in this practice to some extent for longer than I am even aware of. I am new here, so if this has already been addressed in another post, please forgive me, but I am wondering if this is a method commonly used by others who engage in of have engaged in self-harm practices, or if it is an extremely unusual method. I find it to be extremely scary and unnerving.I was once an elite USA National Team athlete for my sport, an individual Summer Olympics sport, and competed in my first Olympic Trials at only the age of 14. I won US Nationals in my specialty event  when I was 15. At the age of 16, I was featured in Sports Illustrated. I maintained a 4.0 GPA pretty much consistently throughout high school. I received a full athletic scholarship to my dream school, and was fortunate enough to attend a university with compassionate faculty who continued to honor that scholarship for four years, even after I was forced to retire from my sport halfway through my freshman year, when my mental illness became too unmanageable to cope with. From 2009-2012, I enjoyed success working and performing in a competitive field of the entertainment industry, but became overwhelmed during a particularly draining depressive episode, and not only had to walk away from a career I was passionate about, but also became fully incapable of functioning on a "normal" level in all areas of my life, isolating completely, and ultimately failing to ever complete my education. I have been homeless since March 6th, and have been incapable of providing adequate food for myself. Scared, helpless, and out of options, I attempted to take my own life on March 9th, and fortunately, I failed, and was placed in a genuinely wonderful psychiatric hospital that has benefitted me far more than any of my previous hospitalizations. I take all of my medications as prescribed and with regularity, and have educated myself about my illnesses as much as possible. Upon leaving the hospital, I felt overwhelmed by hopelessness, the chaos of my life, and my lack of stability and resources. On March 19, I engaged in my most recent incident of self harm, one of my most severe incidents. I am hoping that it is my last. I am terrified of the consequences of these injuries, because I know they can be serious, especially in the instances where I've engaged in this form of self harm before prior injuries have healed. I have never once sought medical attention for my head injuries, out of fear that domestic abuse may be suspected, and the fear of being committed to a psychiatric treatment facility where the quality of care is less than ideal. That being said, I do not feel that I am a danger to myself or others, and I am trying to remain hopeful and positive through the ordeals that I am facing, without resorting to dangerous self-harm tendencies as an attempt to cope with my bleak reality. A few days ago, in the midst of an anxiety attack so severe that my limbs went numb, I learned a more healthy coping technique used in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy that I personally found to be useful and an adequate alternative to self-harm, which I have been using whenever I feel the urge to self-harm, and that is to simply hold an ice pack (not too cold) or a few ice cubes in my hand until the feeling passed. I was shocked to find that it was a very helpful technique, at least for me personally. I would encourage anyone struggling with urges to self-harm to consider trying this approach if possible. Any feedback (preferably kind or sensitive feedback) would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 
So I did cut my thighs and I've stopped and I'm becoming emotionally stable enough as to where I want to start dating. There is a girl in my physics class at the university that I go to and I'm going on a date with her but I'm worried about her seeing the scars if she does. I don't know how girls react to guys that have cut before because I obviously have and there are scars, which are noticeable but I've quit. I just want to know what to know how women react when they see guys with old self harm scars because now I'm scared of approaching other girls solely due to the fact that I don't want them seeing or freaking out. Any input is appreciated.
So I have a friend I've known for a little over a year now. We've spent a lot of time together and have a strong bond. But now I'm very worried.He's told me about how everything has been stressful for him this month and is strongly thinking about self harming. He's also told me about how close he's come to it. The last thing I want is for one of my friends, or anyone, to start doing this. My worry is that time zones keep us apart, so I need advice to help him when I can't be there. I'm here for him every minute I can be when he says he's not well.  I'm deeply concerned about him, and I don't want him to start even thinking about self harming. Does anyone have advice about  what I could suggest to him when he's alone? I've not dealt with things like this in a long time and I need some help to make sure this doesn't turn into something worse.
Recently been going through a bit of a rough time..  Few pieces of bad news and various other things not going to plan.  Won't bore you with details there as it's not what i want to talk about.Majority of my previous cuttings were always along my legs.  I always hated my legs so never got them out anyway, made it a nice discreet place to cover. Over some years racked up quite a collection of scars. Some nastier than others.  Some with real stories.. others.. i just don't know.I was never one for a single slash.  My favourite tool had become broken glass. Razor blades scared me a little too much and required too little effort.  I got angry, and felt i needed to punish myself.  I liked to hack and slash, sometimes quite aggressively.To those i confided in about it at the time and since (which is not many), i'd joke about my being able to play some good games of noughts and crosses with the scars at least!  Mostly long and defined but not too deep diagonal slashes. Though once or twice i had took things a bit too far, once with a broken bottle and once with a very large bread knife.  Both of these really should have had stitches as i'm now left with a scar about 1 inch wide and 5 long on the inside of my calf... and one about 2 1/2 inches wide 4 long on the outside of the same leg. I just cleaned the wounds with salt water myself rather than see anybody about it.  This time i just had a small cerrated knife to hand, one used in the house as a general cutlery knife. I did a couple of test cuts.. didn't seem to leave much of a mark.  So i went back for a few more.  Harder.  and could see the previous cuts begin to slowly turn red.  I'd forgotten they wouldn't bleed straight away.  Decided to stop at seven.  Took all of 5 minutes, and Instantly,  i felt regret."What the fuck am i doing?" I thought.  I haven't done this for years!  I watched them a while and the feelings of the outside pain taking over from the inside hurt came back.  I left them bleed and took a few deep breaths concentrating on the pain.  I think i finished my wine took a valium and nodded off shortly after.  There wasn't much blood.  Though in the morning i saw had left a few stains on my bed sheets when i woke up in the morning.  Got dressed for work and felt sore.  Haven't thought about doing it since,  perhaps it was just an experiment to see if it could help me again,  but i had also decided that it never helped in the first place.Now i can't wear any shorts or skirts through spring while they heal.  Great.  Sorry Reddit.. I just wanted to get this out.  Perhaps this can be closure for me never to approach this way of dealing with my emotions again.  At least i hope.   tl;dr :  Mostly me venting a little of my past and mind. and how overall it wasn't worth the revisit for me.  All i feel is regret and embarrassment.  Time to be positive, and not let this happen again.  Thanks for listening anyone who read. This support group is amazing, as this is such a delicate subject to breach with people face to face.  Stay positive and help each other.Cheers'n'Gone - and remember to be careful.Kazanaran.
Does alcohol trigger cutting for anyone else? I was 3 weeks clean until last night. Housemates are moving out so we had a big dinner party/piss up. Over the course of the evening I began to feel worse and worse and after a while I retreated into room and ended up with a few new cuts on my legs. Meanwhile they went out clubbing or something. I've decided I should avoid all alcohol for a while. I'm annoyed its come to this. Today I've got no urge to cut so it seems its entirely in the alcohol.
I've been suffering with self-harm since i was in elementary school. I'm 18 now and it's still going on. I scrape my skin away on my arms, burn myself with ice and salt, and cut my legs. I've tried other coping mechanisms but none work, but I know i can't keep hurting myself. I know i'm strong and I can get through this. Thank you all for being so strong and holding on. 
I was sitting in history class, in which I excel, attacking my arm with a fountain pen and paper clip.  As I scratched channels into my wrist,  I hit upon something.  Self harm is just a crutch.  It helps you along for a little while, but eventually, it just is another weight to carry.  Conveniently, it's one which, with some work, can be throw away.
I've been clean for three months. This morning my fwb was taking a shower and I saw his pocket knife on the end table and I picked it up and I REALLY wanted to cut, but he walked in before I was able to. I don't even know why I wanted to do it. I just did. Has anyone else been through this? Also, it worries me a little bit because I really want to go as long as possible without cutting and I'm nervous I won't be able to do it.
Just putting my words to paper in a sense. The idea that someone might sympathise or empathise with me makes me feel better I suppose, but really its just me saying this stuff to help sort my mind out. I cut again, after around 3-4 months of not even coming close to doing it, it all overwhelmed me. I felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness, i felt i had myself to blame for everything, and just self-loathing. Desperately found a razor, having thought I had already gotten rid of them all, and cut myself up. I'm not even sure what I was expecting. I used to feel good when I did it, but now its more like just a numbing sensation to the world around. I don't feel good, but I don''t feel bad. I just feel like the bad feelings end, and that's it, back to life. Guess it's back to being somewhat dependent on this shit just so I can get through the week without cracking mentally.

It's been nearly 6 months since my last cut. I crave it SO badly. My heart beats faster at the thought, the rush, the relief. I'm so scared. I don't want to do it. But I DO. SO BADLY. It's EVERYTHING.I miss it. I miss the relief. I miss the freedom. Please help me. What do I do?!
My sister has been self harming, and was admitted to an inpatient program a week ago after we discovered she was continuing to cut, the cutting was extensive, and she admitted to having thoughts of suicide.Since then, we have gone through her social media accounts and gathered a lot of info on the extent that she cuts. She has pictures of her cuts and videos of her cutting posted, captions saying "that felt good :)".  She has a bunch of friend on social media who post about their cutting as well.I'm extremely disturbed by this. I feel so bad that my 12 year old sister feels this emotional pain and is driven to cut. I'm also disturbed by the *extent* to which she has cut. She has words carved into her leg; has cut her hands, face and breasts; and has cut in retaliation for getting her phone taking away. I'm really scared for the future. I'm afraid she has deeper mental problems than simply depression and anxiety. I'm worried that this inpatient program isn't enough for her, and she will start cutting again,  or do more drastic things. 
Hey,I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for makings scars look less.. bad. Two week old cut, deeper than I meant. Keep getting questions. Any thoughts? 
It's been 3 years since I used to do it regularly (I've had quite a few relapses, but nevermind that) and I can't stop thinking about it. There's a pack of razor blades in my bathroom cabinet and I am just tempted. 
I have never posted here before,but I have lurked for awhile now. It may seem like a stupid reason to relapse,but my SO has recently shown no sexual interest in me. Granted i have gained some weight since we have started dating,so I understand how he can see me as disgusting, but it still hurts. He insists it just because he is tired all the time but idk. After I thouht about all of this in my shower I felt the urge to just.. punish my disgusting body. Sorry,again, if this is a stupid thing to post about but, I felt the need to.  
3 years ago I was in a deep depression and suicidal. However I met my ex and he showed me that life is good and there is beautiful things in it. It was a struggle but with his help I helped myself.. One of the things he said to me was "don't bring that with your new self." And it always inspired me not to do it.These last couple of weeks have been overwhelming... and kind of stressful and I've been feeling blue. I'm making big life changes and going to be moving soon and I'm very scared. I'm scared of failure so badly. I know if I try and never give up I could do all I want. But the what ifs just scare me. And of course it's difficult my ex is my ex but that's getting easier slowly.Been a week since I self-harmed. I keep wanting to like an addiction. To control some kind of pain. But I know it doesn't do anything but hurt me. I don't feel ashamed we all make mistakes. I am happy just a little depressed right now and overwhelmed. But I know great things are to come. As long as I don't give up. R give in to that bad habit.Keep yalls heads up :-) life is beautiful and you can all be happy.
I don't know what to do with these feelings, they seem so out of place now that I'm a grown-ass woman. I've respected my body enough not to take a blade to it since at least 2006, but lately I've been really down, and tonight I had to leave my toddler with my sister because I just couldn't deal with the urges and him at the same time. I didn't do it, but I was close enough that I'm very concerned.I have an appointment with a therapist on monday and I can't wait, I need to talk to somebody. I just feel so alien... like I'm watching my life through someone else's eyes. And I don't like what I see... I hate my job, I hate people and I just want everyone to leave me alone and everything to stop hurting so much. I need help staying strong, please let me know how you cope.Sorry for the rant. 
I don't have the greatest track record with men. If they are no good I usually fall. I had met a really great guy that started off as just support and friendship. I fell head over heels for him but he was married.  He told me his marriage was over had been for a while and we started something.  I started cutting less and actually began to like myself. I had truly thought I found my soulmate. He told his wife all about me obviously she was hurt and angry. I told him I would go away but he told me no. Today I get a message from them both that they are going to work on their marriage.  Where I am happy for them cause I only want his happiness I am feeling completely used and like trash. The first time I let someone in completely and I'm left feeling so dirty. I just pull the knife across my skin to bleed away the pain and bring the emptiness back. I want to go back to feeling half alive.  I truly hate life right now
Me and my friend of 4 years live 2 days apart. We talk over text and the phone. About a year ago she helped me when I went through a scrap of SH. While trying to help one of her friends with SH, she cracked under a lot of pressure and also began to SH....she and her friend are going to start going to therapy, but its driving me crazy to not be able to help...is there anything at all I can say or do to help her friend and her? Thank you all in advance.
To be honest not sure if it should really be considered a relapse I've kind of been relapsing every week which is really just cutting once a week, since you have to recover to relapse. But the point is, Ive gotten to a place where I feel like I might be able to be clean. My "relapses" are usually just one small cut and don't feel too much like a problem. Tonight I ended up with multiple large cuts, band aids on every limb and some newly blood stained towels. So, I'm going to say I relapsed, hard. I don't know what to do, because in all honesty I feel pretty darn good right now, but I can't keep doing this. I want to get better. I don't want this to be who I am anymore. When my friends ask if I'm ok, meaning am I actually ok and not thinking about my razors, I want my "I'm fine" answers to be the truth. I feel good, but I know I should hate myself for tonight. I just can't even make myself regret it right now. How do I get better when it feels this good? I just want to stop, but I can't figure out how.

I've never really spoken about this ever in my life so I hope this is the right place to just unload.For as long as I can remember I've hit myself. Usually in response to a stressful situation where I cannot find a solution or at least an out.I have always felt like if something went wrong it was somehow my fault, that I should bear the guilt.Lately things have gotten particularly bad to the point where I think that I may be in danger of causing real and permanent damage. I have been hitting myself quite hard in the head, to the base of my skull and to the sides of my head around the temples. Some days I feel that life is so bad that I want to pass out and never wake up.I don't see any value in myself. I have a SO and baby but I always think that they will be better off without me in the long run as they don't need a partner/parent with these problems. They have family here so they would have all the support they need and could move on with their lives with little disrution if anything happened to me.I'm starting to get quite bad pain in my head when I hit myself in the side of the head. Sometimes I see a bright flash of light. The muscles at the base of my head are inflamed and sore. I get ringing in my ears from time to time.I immediately panic after I've harmed myself but I know that I'll do it again.
This has been the hardest month ever. The need to calm down with this, or to just get myself focused is so overwhelming. It's settled down a bit towards the last couple of days, and my scars are already fading. Here's to another month.
Haven’t really had the urge to harm since I found out I was expecting. Been doing great really. My SO might have to deploy after I give birth but im working with my friend so that im not alone during that time as that’s a major trigger for me. Work has been ok, this past month was super stressful. I work with memory care patients and there are three neighborhoods. I was in the really bad one. Super stressful just constant non stop work. I was written up at work today because one of the residents went to bed in am clothes even though we had tried to get him in pj’s he didn’t want to. Well since it’s in his care plan to assist with pm dressing I was in violation of his care plan which is considered neglect so I was written up. I was also then given a verbal warning about “my attitude and work ethic” now that really threw me for a loop. A year of coming in on time all the time, always in a great mood with good energy and im sorry my attitude and work ethic? I was told that all I do is sit on my ass and bark orders while not doing work which is clearly not true but since five people had apparently made that complaint it must be true. Attempting to explain that me “barking orders” was more than likely me attempting to communicate with my co worker which was probably misunderstood as barking orders but to no avail. I pointed out how isnt it funny that in one year i’ve gotten one compliment from upper management, how the two times i’ve been written up was when I worked that neighborhood, the only time i’ve ever had any complaints was when I worked that area. When im in the other two areas there’s never any problems. I went on break later and called my SO then put my two weeks in. He’s supportive and I dont have to work, I work because I want to and I enjoyed the job. It just really set me off that after a year of being a hard working employee I get told im not working at all. Had a co worker go missing, stopped answering calls and no one can get a hold of her or her family and work refused to call the police for a welfare check, makes me feel good that I can disappear and no one would really notice or care enough to follow up on it. Not really sure if there’s a point to this wall of text. Just not feeling appreciated I guess. Had the thought of harming but it’s not worth it. Tomorrow is a new day. I guess I just needed to vent and seeing as how I consider this sub home I felt like sharing. Thanks for reading/ 
I want to cut myself, i just dont want my bf to see it and be disgusted by me or feel responsible... But i want to do it. Im just thinking about it and it seems so relieving 

It's something I've started with lately. Whenever people make me feel bad or uncomfortable I imagine them with rabbits ears. Some are big, some are small. Some are furry or not, and all kinds of colors. This is just a small spice of crazy I add to my everyday. They also twitch and move depending on that persons mood.Today was not a good day. Within a few moments my room-mate managed to make me feel incredibly insecure and worthless (when meaning well), and reddit made me feel like an idiot. This made me want to share this crazy thing I do with someone. Stay strong :) 
I've never dealt with self harm personally, and as such I know very little about it. She wants to stop hurting herself but doesn't really have a better way of coping with the stress in her life, apparently the physical pain helps distract from the emotional pain. She's an 8th grader and as such doesn't have too much control over her life. I'm the only one she trusts with this information, as unfortunately her parents are part of the problem. I am also aware there is an addictive aspect to self-harm, making it much one difficult to overcome.So I ask, as someone with no experience or knowledge in the matter of self harm, how can I help my friend? And how can she help herself? Much thanks for any help you may provide, if any more information is needed I will happily share it.
Im trying to remain positive, and keep myself distracted but im finding it hard to do so. All i want to do is hide, away from everyone, be alone in the dark and cut. My birthday is coming up in a fortnight and i dont want to celebrate it. I hate the attention, i really hate getting gifts. It feels wrong when someone gives me something because i believe i dont deserve it. It takes so much energy to smile and act happy when all im doing is screaming on the inside. I tell people that i dont want to do anything but no one believes me. Im sick of my mind being an emotional rollercoaster, im sick of struggling, im sick of trying not to self harm when thats all i want to do.
I'm about to lose the last friend I have. I can feel the panic bubbling up and my self-harm voice getting louder and I'm trying to distract myself but it's hard. I would feel better if I self-harmed but this is the longest I've ever went without doing it and I don't want to relapse. 
<a little backstory: My SO is bulimic, depressed and has panic attacks after eating etc., we've been together for close to 9 months>Yesterday, we were having a perfectly normal holiday-day, being all lazy and shitWe felt like it'd be a great time to watch a movie and eat some food since it was dinner time already.We made food, fired up a movie on netflix and started watching. She got a panic attack about 10 minutes later, and tried to harm herself with a sewing needle, scratching and stuff, but I took the needle away by force since she was in full panic mode and didn't respond to anything.I threw the needle to god knows where, just in a random direction away from her, and tried to make her feel more comfortable as usual, talking to her etc. holding her, when she suddenly bolted up and got an exacto-knife style thing from her nightstand and just held it in his hands for a while.She moved the blade to her thigh and shouted that she'll do it, and that I shouldn't watch.I tried to talk her out of doing it but she didn't respond to me, I kept talking to her however.Then she just did itI'm pretty sure she didn't know which edge of the blade was the sharp one since she tried to cut with it, but there was no mess or anything, so it was the dull edge.I grabbed the blade out of her hand and snapped the sharp end in two.After that, I made sure she didn't have any sharp objects hidden anywhere (searched the nightstand and her table), and put her to the bed where she passed out (I didn't just leave her there, I observed if she was OK first).Had to make a hard choice, called her psychologist and told her about the things she has done.After that, told his dad and I just had to leave in tears since I can't handle it anymore.Love her, and really hope she gets better, since she's being watched intensively by a therapist and a social worker so that she gets better.  Sorry, I know this isn't my blog or anything, just had to vent out somewhereAlso, sorry about terrible formatting
I have a hard time feeling like I am actually going to make it. Like, actually get someone in life.I'm too scared of getting hurt to try.The hurt feeling is what triggers the other things.. if I just keep myself locked up I will be better off.I feel that way because when I let people attempt to love me... either I get hurt or they do. I have a hard time accepting love because I don't feel like I deserve it......and right when I finally start to feel like I do I end up getting hurt.I don't deserve it because I just feel like I am impossible to love. I'm too closed, too untrusting. But I am like that because I feel like I don't deserve it, it's a circle that keeps happening...I don't deserve love. I do deserve to harm myself.I've made too many mistakes before. Ones I should have learned from. I've done things that I regret. Multiple times. I'm unloved, unwanted.Cutting is the only outlet I have for all my pain, anger, feelings. I can't kill myself because I would hurt those around me. I want a release. Since I can't "handle" it, I want to handle it the way I want to. How else am I going to get all of this tension out?I can't drink and I can't get high, I can't kill myself, so it only leaves me one thing to do... I want to physically hurt...

I am going through shit and it is making me feel like I am a fuck up. That everything I have done or am doing is bad and that I need to be punished for it. I have tried so badly to not cut, like really cut myself hard...but its so hard... I am so tempted to do it, or kill myself. My life feels like hell right now and I can not deal with it. I feel bad for being me and I can not be me for much longer... I can not take this much longer... I am trying so hard and can not handle it much longer. I am also seeking help and I am doing what they recommend, but my parents (who are the cause of my pain) are not willing to help me at all. I do not know what to do, and I am in so much pain.
I try to steer clear of this sub most times because I don't want to be triggered so I apologize if reading this strikes up feelings you're trying to avoid.I'm here because I feel stuck. I think I am in a depressed funk as a result of binge drinking this past weekend. I'm in college (20 F) so I wasn't alone in getting way too drunk but it still wasn't good for my body. I ended up blacking out and acting overtly flirty to one of my male friends when I have a boyfriend who lives 5 hours away. The next morning, I was informed of my embarrassing behavior and I also physically felt terrible. I faced the music and confessed to my boyfriend about how I acted and he told me he's got a lot of thinking to do. I know I need to face my consequences of poor decisions but I really love him and I don't want to break up. Back to my point in posting, I have felt depressed the past 24 hours and I have been thinking a ton about cutting. I haven't felt this many urges since last September and it scares me. I also would really love to talk to my boyfriend about this but I'm afraid he'll think it's attention seeking due to him being unhappy with me right now. I don't know who to talk to right now and I feel so close to doing it. This post is my effort to get it out safely.Much love, thanks for reading.
Why the hell did I even start this? It's all day I do crap like this.All day. At school I dig into my skin with pencils and no one sees. How could you not see? Am I not worth saving? At home I always break down and dig into my skin anyway I can. Most times I don't go straight to a blade. But...it's been hard, you know? All my bad cuts and shit are on my legs. So no one sees.Anyone I've told gave up on me so long ago, or laughed at me. The only person I trust is gone. It messed me up too much mentally.I don't even understand why I started this. I was fine...right? Fuck...how do I even begin to stop...I'm sorry. Ignore me. Sorry.
I'm new here, and so far I've been really impressed with the community. So impressed, in fact, that I've decided to share something that no one else knows. Thank goodness for anonymity.I don't really know why I did it; maybe I was just feeling alone, or empty, or something of the sort, and just last night my friend told me how proud she was that I had gone a week without cutting. But I just did, like an hour ago. It's never anything deep, it's usually with the metal tip of a mechanical pencil and this time it was a paper clip. But still, I know someone's going to find out, because I can never keep these things hidden, and all of my wonderful friends who've been helping me out are going to be so disappointed. They'll tell me they aren't, but they will be. Just needed to get that out there so that someone somewhere knows what just happened. 
Every time I talk to her about it, I come away frustrated and hurt and now I'm actually crying. It's infuriating that she knows cutting is bad for her, and she knows that people (myself included) want her to quit, but she doesn't care and keeps cutting. She tells me nearly every time that she cuts and it makes her feel guilty, not because of the cutting, but because she knows it worries me.A few weeks ago, when I found out about her cutting, I called the suicide hotline and they called the police, who took her to the hospital. She was extremely nonchalant the entire time. Both the doctor and I urged her to talk to her counselor (she is supposed to be seeing a counselor through our university's counseling center, free to students) about getting put on medication. She's been on citalopram ever since. At the hospital, when she talked about when she's cut, it seemed she was cutting every two weeks or so. She just told me tonight that she's only gone one day in the past week without cutting, and that she hasn't seen her counselor in two weeks (if she doesn't go to her appointment on Wednesday, basically all her future appointments will be automatically cancelled). I have thought about going with her or taking her there, but I have a lab during that time.It's incredibly frustrating to talk to her. Love her to death, but I can't keep this up, lest I risk resenting her. I struggle with depression too; I'm on zoloft. I have never self-harmed, but I have wanted to kill myself a few times in the past. I also have the tendency to take on the emotions of other people and letting it consume me and the more I write about this, the worse I feel, and I have homework due in 50 minutes so I'm just going to quit now.Sorry for the wall of text, this was more of a train-of-thought thing than a well-thought-out post.
I have reached out to a friend and told him how serious I was about suicide and about the cutting but he has his own life and family and just cant be there for me. That's okay. I have called Doctors twice to set up appointments but they were not accepting patients at the time. It's been incredibly hard for me to reach out and I feel like when I have it has led to nothing. I don't know where to go next or how to get help. But I NEED it. I'm serious. If nothing changes it's only a matter of time. Hell, I even got over my fear and pride and called what I thought was a helpline tonight and I got an answering machine. 
That's really at the heart of all this. I'm sorry I'm just not in a good state to be writing a long post. If you have suggestions though I would love to hear them. Just going to cry it out for a bit.

So ive seen people post about ODing on things like Advil/tylenol (purposefully). But does it still count sort of as Self Harm if u dont take enough to be hospitalized? For example if u took like 3 extra strength naproxen to mess with ur stomach and hurt urself cuz u know its not healthy? I mean technically i guess it is "self harm" but is it enough to really count? 
I've been clean for over two years now but for the past week or so i've been having a really hard time with depersonalization. It's really bad- nothing feels real. I'm not sure what's a dream and what's not. I've used all my coping methods and i've talked to my best friend about it but i'm stuck- all I want to do is dig into my skin until i feel something, anything. i just want to feel real.
Today is a bad day for me.  I'm not diagnosed with depression or bipolar disorder officially due to the fact that when my Narcissistic mother took me to a psychiatrist, as soon as those words were out of his mouth, we left.This is my first post here but there's plenty in my history about me and my life growing up if you want to know more about me.  Today, has been really bad.  I've had a lot of issues lately, mentally and physically.  I cut my family off from contact last April but they're still on my facebook (so I can make sure the crazies aren't going to up and visit me like my mom already has).I'm not really even sure what happened today, what was so different.  My method of self harm has always been very subtle.  I like pins.  Safety pins, or straight sewing needles, or maybe thumbtacks.  I scratch my arm with it or will push them through a few layers of skin.  For the last couple hours, I've been poking through and scratching my left forearm like crazy.  I've been trying to fight it all day.  I've tried a couple different hobbies, tried singing, tried moving to a different spot I don't sit in often by the balcony doors of my apartment to try and get a different perspective on things.  But eventually I broke down, went over to my sewing box, and pulled out my safety pins.But it's still so much better than what was going through my head.  Images of nooses was flying through my mind for half the afternoon, while I desperately searched for something to distract me.  But the imagery was relentless and I was starting to get scared of my own head.  I was half ready to call up my fiance and ask him to come home from work early even though I know he can't today.  So, to get rid of the nooses in my head, I went for the pins in my arm.I've only done this maybe 3-5 times in the last 4 years, this is huge for me.  I can't believe I broke down and scratched up my arm.  I did this as a teenager while living in an abusive home but I was always very careful.  Couldn't actually cut because that's much more noticeable.  But pin holes in my arm?  Nothing.  I'm a lazy cutter.  I just can't handle the fact that I messed up my arm again.  Hell, I'm sitting here typing this with 4 safety pins and 7 straight pins sticking out of my forearm still.The worst part is I was so proud of myself earlier.  I could hear my neighbour yelling at his daughter (he never does this by the way, I've lived next to him for a year and this is the 2nd time I've heard him yell at her) and he was stomping around.  I was on the verge of an anxiety attack but I managed to stave it off by just breathing then getting lost in music for a while.  I saved myself from an anxiety attack, that's massive for me.  No hyperventilating or freaking out, nothing.  And yet this is how I end my evening.  Fuck.  i was just so proud of myself, and I hate to admit it but now that I have pain in my forearm to focus on, I'm so much more relaxed and I finally have something to focus on, the pain.  I just don't want to be like this.  I have a daughter.  I have obligations.  I have a fiance who loves me like crazy and brought me from Texas to Ireland so we could be together.  A fiance that has had to take my pins out of my sewing box before because he was worried I'd go back to this.  And now he'll be home in less than an hour and a half for date night, and I'll have to be honest with him and tell him, then show him what I've done.  And I don't want to.  I hate myself so much right now.  And he's going to be so upset and disappointed in me.  I just can't handle it right now, I can't handle any of it.  I can't handle motherhood, or the nerve pain in my neck.  I can't handle cutting my family off and being on my own with the exception of one friend I brought from my old life and my man.  My man, who I hurt over and over just from being me.  I can't handle living with constant pain in my neck, back and right side in general without being able to cause and control the pain myself.  I hate living.  It fucking sucks fighting my own mind every. single. day.  But I do, and I don't let my daughter know anything is wrong.  And I'm a damn good mother.  Everyone that's ever met my kid tells me I must be doing something right with her.  She's healthy and happy and absolutely amazing.  Which is exactly why I don't deserve her, and why she deserves someone better, more capable.Her bedtime is coming up soon and I have stuff to do to get ready for that.  And yet I can't bring myself to roll my sleeve back up so I can take the pins out of my arm.  But I sure can't let her see them.  I don't want to take them out.  I like controlling this pain in my arm.  Fuck.  Talk about a sudden relapse.  It's been over a year since my fiance felt the need to take my pins.  And here I thought I was making so much fucking progress.  Ha.
I am working with adolescent girls who cut, I am trying to form a list of things that have helped others distract themselves from cutting. What have you done that has helped you?
Quick back story, Have been suffering from depression, anxiety and [misophonia](http://www.misophonia.com/symptoms-triggers/). since I was 10, so about 20 years now. Never until recently have I thought about harming myself. I have been in therapy for about 6 years now and I believe we are getting to the really hard stuff, stuff I have repressed for years, so that might be one reason, there is a hundred factors that I won't go into that may be contributed to the harming incidents, that's no the point of this post.The first time was approx 7 months ago, something came up that I couldn't handle and after sobbing and over thinking the situation, I suddenly had the urge to cut my wrist. So I did (three lines, not too serious) and  my mind was flooded with the feeling of the knife... almost a good feeling, Like I didn't have to worry about the situation any more, the cuts were there, I could see it, do something about it. The next day, I felt incredibly guilty and ashamed that I would do that, Even thinking about it makes me feel a little sick to the stomach. I compulsively hid the marks until they were healed. After that I tried not to think about the incident and had no more urges to harm myself until 2 weeks ago. Another huge incidence happened and the same feelings came up when I cut again (same style as last time). This time I found myself thinking more of self harm.This all led up to last Sunday, I was having a particularly bad day. i spent the whole day contemplating my future, thinking I will never get out of depression, etc, not even motivated enough to turn on the T.V.  in the evening I had had enough and tried to call one of my support people. My mom, usually a great support was not having a good day herself and was cold to me. After I hung up with her I was so Mad, depressed, frustrated, one of my lowest points ever. Without thinking i head to the kitchen and grab the first knife I see , but it wasn't sharp enough. Then I saw the steak knife with serrated edges and without thinking (Deep inside I think I wanted to see lots of blood flow)  I was sobbing as I pressed down hard an cut, suddenly pulling back, realizing my wrist tendon had hit the knife, stopping it. For a moment I think I almost had a moment of euphoria, which quickly turned to terror, deep, deep, sadness and quilt. I cleaned up the blood and put pressure on the wound. at this time my psychiatrist phoned me back from missing my call earlier. I told him what happened and he convinced me to call 911. Off to the hospital (I only needed 2 stitches). When I returned home I felt scared that I would do something like that, i threw the knife away and every so often I see the serrated edges in my mind and shudder.Since that trip to the hospital things have been looking up, I've been working with my therapist and doctor other ways of coping and have a set up backup plans if I feel the need to do it again. Right now thinking of hurting myself scares me, I still feel shame and wear long sleeved shirts allowing no one to see my bandage.My question is though, to people who have most probably felt the way I felt. Why did I hurt myself in the first place? Why did it actually feel good? What does self harm do for you? I am totally new to this world and want to figure out my reasons for doing what I did, specially since I just started in the last year.     
I have now taken the photos for the photo project Hope to Quit ([klick here to read the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/StopSelfHarm/comments/2s227o/an_invitation_to_quit_and_be_part_of_a_photo/)).Thank you to all who showed interest in the project. I got two participants in the end and they have both given me their permission to show their letters publicly. [The photo series can be viewed here](http://imgur.com/a/O9GoJ). **Warning, images of self-harm tools and the stories told may be triggering!**My course is done and I'm pleased with the result. However the original idea was to get 5-10 letters for a broader picture of the issue. I think these stories are important to tell, so if anybody's interested, feel free to send me a PM if you want to be a part of an updated version of this project.*Edit: Spelling.*
Hey, you guys can call me Indi. I'm a 21 year old gender queer individual; finishing up college, dealing with a lot of emotional bullshit. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and general anxiety disorder and I've struggled with feelings of depression and worthlessness for basically my whole life (my parents told me they noticed a sudden and distinct change in my mood when I was 5).Anyway, the only times I've even engaged in self harm were during anxiety attacks when the only thing I could think to do to relieve my intense restlessness, fear, and self-loathing was to claw at my own skin. I've never cut or anything like that, mostly because I'm afraid of how much it would hurt and I don't want to get infections or something stupid like that.Recently tho, my depression had gotten worse and my thoughts of suicide have been slowly shifting from passive to active, tho I haven't made any plans to kill myself yet. Plus, I'm still determined to live; I recognize that I have a lot to live for still and I don't wanna give that up. The fact that one of my greatest anxieties is about the afterlife helps with keeping me alive too. :PBut as a suicidal person who can't kill themself, I'm feeling a bit... unsatisfied. I'm finding myself wanting to make compromises, ranging from the benign to threatening. Getting tattoos or piercings (too expensive), taking up smoking (also too expensive, also smells terrible), or... cutting (see above). The general idea is that since I can't die, I want to at least find a way to hurt myself. That's close enough. Not trying to sound dramatic, but that's how my brain has been rationalizing it.Basically, I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to curtail these desires. I'm kinky and also have a kinky partner, so we do painplay stuff (in a risk aware and safe manner, don't worry) and sometimes that helps, but I can't demand their attention and presence every time these feelings come up; it just happens too often and I'm already pretty damn clingy as it is.Thoughts?
I used to burn myself about 3 years ago, rarely cut but had a few times.Depression (something I've been struggling with as long as I can remember) has worsened over the past few years, I started burning myself once every few months, then once every few weeks, then I went to cutting myself because I can hardly feel the pain of the burns any more no matter how hot they are. My upper arms are a mess now and my girlfriend gets very upset when I do self harm - she does too, for the record, and when either of us self harm, normally the other one does out of guilt and stuff (it's a very unhealthy experience for everyone) - but I don't know what else to do. Nothing cheers me up no matter how good things are going. I can't help myself but I don't want to do this to her (my SO).Not expecting advice, just need somewhere to vent.
1: Is there any way to get rid of/fade away scars? I'm a dancer and I have some very visible scars in areas that the clothes I have to wear don't hide.2: How do I make the urges go away? I self harm because of my sexuality, because of my gender, because of my religion and because of hating my looks no matter how much I change them. (I'm pretty sure it's not body dysmorphia and I'm also pretty sure I just mangled the word dysmorphia.)3: What are some ways to make myself stop? It's too easy to hide and too enjoyable to quit doing easily.
I started self-harming in my teens. Since I only did it a handful of times per year, I initially didn't even think of it as an addiction. I finally started to realize the truth several years later. It's been 8 years now since I first started. Currently I've gone for almost a year without self harming -- my longest streak. But I still think about it regularly and even crave it at times.One of the new factors that has helped me resist is being in a long term relationship. I remind myself how I have no places on my body to hide injuries from my SO. Another is thinking of getting more scars. I have some scars on my arm that are quite obviously the result of SI and I feel like I will always have to wear long sleeves at work because of it. The rest is stuff like reminding myself that it's not a healthy coping mechanism and that the feeling will pass, etc.I think I've gotten to the stage where I can control the urges for the most part. But sometimes it just feels so easy to slip up...-edit-I was feeling depressed when I posted this and I appreciate the responses. It's heartening to hear about people moving past self harming. It also makes me feel less alone to hear your stories, especially since it's something I've never talked about with friends or family. Thanks everyone for sharing.
I've been struggling with self harm for a while now, but recently, I've been doing pretty well. I try not to count how long it's been, because it's just better to try to not think about it at all, but I'm pretty sure I've gone for about a year without cutting, but that doesn't change the fact that the scars are still there.I know that I'm going to have to deal with them for the rest of my life, most likely, but recently I've been trying to put some effort into helping them heal, and I was wondering if any of you had some suggestions. Right now I've been using cocoa butter lotion every day or so, when I remember at least. The scars themselves are all on a single patch. When I used to do it, I always limited myself to the same area, reopening old scars again and again because in my mind, it was already fucked up. Now there's just this large patch of overlapping ones. I know that most of it is there to stay, with how much damage I've done, but I feel that putting efforts into trying to heal them will at least help me not fall back into it again.I'd really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks for reading.
So hey I guess. To make a long story short, my girlfriend used to, you know, and she's starting to think about it again. I don't want her to feel bad in any way and I've tried my best to make it better but it doesn't seem to help. The thing that makes it harder for me is that when she starts feeling bad she doesn't really talk to me and leaves me to worry. I'm starting to think negatively because she does, she's a big part of my life and when she feels bad I do to. I need your help guys, I feel like all this is on me and that I have to help her all myself but I can hardly take it anymore. I would really appreciate any help that I can get, how to deal with this, or some encouraging and inspiring words to her. Everything helps, I just need to talk about it. This is my first post ever and I don't really know how reddit works but I will try to respond to every answer. Thanks on beforehand. - A
I just need to know if anyone else does this. I've recently started self-harming because of the guilt I feel for sins. And I also have OCD, so it's also part of that. I have to hurt myself three times in a row for it to make me feel better. Three hits, three cuts, three whatever. I know it's irrational and is not connected in any way, but it makes me feel worse which perpetuates the cycle. Does anyone else do this?  Also, how can i tell my therapist? I've been doing so good, we even moved to every other week, but now I'm failing. What will she do? How will it go? I trust her, but it's still scary. 

I've recently started to cut myself again. It isn't too bad. I felt bad afterwards and wanted to tell my boyfriend because it would be even worse if he found out without my telling him. His immediate reaction was to threaten me with cutting himself twice for each one time I cut. He doesn't want to hurt himself but it's "the only way I know how to stop you. If you have a better idea, tell me". Being threatened is just making me feel worse. I can't help that I feel the urge to cut. Most of the time I can control it myself, but the one time I slip up, I'm threatened and feel guilty about something I can't really control. Can someone help? I'm desperately searching for a better way to stop than to be threatened... Am I overreacting? 
My wife cuts herself when she cant handle her emotions its mostly when we fight and she wont talk to anybody, I know talking with me doesn't help because i'm the reason she cuts.she is a complete introvert with few/no close friends just me and i dont know what to do i dont know who to turn to how can i stop this before it gets any worse, every time she does it she digs deeper 
(Trigger warning or something I guess)Alright, i have never self harmed, nor felt the need to. But my girlfriend has, and it was bad. The last time she did was about twoish months ago, and she's doing well, and holding up strong since then (she ended up making a promise to me she wouldn't do it again) But today she saw some cuts on her twitter feed and it triggered her. She even got her blades out. But i was able to talk to her and call her before she did anything bad. And she told me that the urges to have been getting bigger and bigger lately. I'm afraid shes going to relapse again and do it. I just want to make sure she'll be okay. How do I make sure that she wont? How do i help her? I can't always be there for her, seeing shes got a crazy mother (long story, but i can't really do anything about it) and shes moving about 40 minutes away from me (i don't have my license yet so it will be hard to get there). And tonight she wasn't doing so well, she triggered and stuff like I said, and her anxiety was acting up horribly. Later after she calmed down a bit and it was all closer to normal levels of anxiety, she got into a small fight with her mother and she took all of her ways of contacting me away, and said we won't be able to hang out for a long long time. I'm so scared i won't be able to help her if it gets worse tonight, or even worse this week (we're on vacation and she's moving Monday).Sorry for all that. I just need help, i don't know what to do, or how to help. So if anyone can provide any help or any bit of reassurance i would really appreciate it. 

Hi all, I've been searching all over for help and I am so glad I found this subreddit. I'm sorry if this turns out long.We've been dating for 8 months now-Long Distance, but we try to see each other every weekend, and I love her so much. She just started cutting this month, and tells me how she finds comfort in the thought of not existing anymore or how she thinks about killing herself. Sometimes I try to assure her that they are just intrusive thoughts and that a lot of people have them but I still take it seriously. She has a lot of problems coming from a divorced family, (dad was abusive), her aunt committed suicide when she was young, her grandparents are battling the worst of Alzheimers right now, she was overweight and developed an eating disorder to lose weight (lost 40 lbs. in 6 months). During those 6 month before I met her she went through about 10 guys who would talk to her but dump her as soon as she wouldn't have sex with them. We're both 20, and lost our virginity to each other and this is also our first relationship if this has anything to do with it.That being said since the beginning of our relationship she was clingy. Very clingy. She cried every time I left in the first month of our relationship, at first I thought it was cute but now it has progressed into being in absolute misery when I leave. What's worse is that I'm usually busy with school, baseball, work, trying to be with my dad before he gets deployed this weekend, where as she goes to school and work but has no friends outside of me so she sits at home all day in her room. We talk on the phone almost every second I can throughout the day because otherwise she becomes lonely and sad. She has told me that there is nothing in this world more important than me and that she would drop everything for me (she has before), and says that I am the only thing keeping her alive. I feel guilty because I don't have as much time to give her as she does for me. I have no money because I don't work weekends to see her and spend everything i make on gas so i cant take her out which becomes an issue as well. I ask to see her arm when we facetime everynight to check for new cuts and she's even cut while we are facetiming. I try not to react too much and say I love her and that she might want to look into seeing somebody about that. My brother cut almost 10 times worse than her but it still scares me and I don't want to dismiss it. She doesn't want her mom to know about any of this but lately she has been saying how she can't promise she'll be there next weekend for me to see her, and always brings up how she's just my spare time and how she's not worth it.  i want to go behind her back and tell her mom but I don't know if that's a good idea or not. I'm very patient but I feel like im losing and I need help.TL;DR- Girlfriend keeps cutting herself and is having suicidal thoughts, has no friends, spends a lot of time alone in her room, devotes everything to me. I'm very busy and can't talk to her as much as she'd like right now, and haven't done as much for her as she does for me. I feel like I create a lot of problems but she says she'll kill herself if I break up with her. I'm not sure what to do.
Hi /r/StopSelfHarm,I'm a former self harmer, who used to cut myself 3 years ago for a period of about 6 months.I now have many completely healed scars on my arms (upper and lower). Before the scars were fully healed I was able to wear shorter sleeves because they were not as noticeable. Now that the scars are fully healed I have to wear long sleeves in order to conceal them from my family who doesn't know about them.As many of you know or can guess, this is tedious and hot in the summer months. I would like to tell my parents so that I can at least be comfortable in short sleeves but I'm afraid that dragging up my past would do nothing but hurt them. I do realize that eventually they will find out. I would really like for them to know just so that there's no secrets between us however it scares me to death to even think about telling them. I feel that they will misunderstand me and think that I still need help (even though it was three years ago, and I will never do it again) or just flat out think I'm hideous (they are very conservative Christians that don't like tattoos and generally think that body modification is gross). I'm not convinced that they will even understand what self harm is. What do you guys think I should do? Has anyone had a similar experience? I will be eighteen in a year, do you think being a legal adult changes anything?
Okay, I struggle with pressing every pimple and pore on my face and back for no got damn reason. It has been extremely bad and it is much better but I can't quit. I seem to punish myself, or feel insecure about something, or get really anxious, and it leads to picking which leads to depression and low self esteem. If I could get over this before it's too late, I have the potential to be a model or do great things or I could actually enjoy living more often. (I haven't in 4.5 yrs.) It's so embarrassing that I've let other people get in my head and I've allowed myself to fuck myself over like this. How many dimes do you know who self destruct on a weekly basis (at least)? And How can I hold my head as high as I used to before I started scarring a little bit? They probably can be treated and diminished and covered up with make up, a beard, and money, but I kind of want to be able to handsomely/beautifully wear it like a tattoo or a shark bite. It ain't bad or really noticeable, but I notice and I want to get better and stop being miserable and not give a fuck how I appear to others. I just want approval from myself.
I didn't really know where this post belonged, but I like this sub and it's related so here it goes.Selfharm and drinking is the two that are "worst" and that I struggle with the most. The other two are smoking and bulimic stuff.I've recently been quitting drinking completely, which is why I now notice that I'm having more urges to selfharm, and I get these thoughts about throwing up. Understand that I have never really had a problem with eating disorders before, and I don't have any problem with food. I'm happy with my weigh and it's not about that.I know that these are all bad ways to act and cope, but whenever I try pulling back or quitting one, the others start becoming worse. Of the four I personally consider smoking the least harmful, and selfharm the second... I know this is crazy, because I've been trying to quit selfharm the most. But strictly speaking about the damage it does to the body, drinking and bingeing are probably worse in my oppinion. Of course this depends on how bad you do each, but I tend to drink far worse than I selfharm.I find smoking the most disgusting habit and I don't really want to smoke. Now the ideal thing would be to quit all of these at the same time, since it's now clear to me that once I quit one, another one takes over. I'm not sure if I could do that though. It seems like a very big achievement.I really-really don't want any eating disorders, which is why I'm trying very hard to ignore those thoughts, but that means that I'm more inclined to "allow" myself to selfharm. I think I should see a therapist or something, but I really don't have the time for that right now...Thanks for listening and stay safe.
I replaced cutting with drugs, alcohol, and any pain I can feel. Like my user name says talk to me or draw what you think of when you see me. I'm interested in both.

He is my best friend, and over time his self harm has just gotten worse and worse. He knows that I know. I'm becoming extremely worried about him, and I have tried reaching out to him telling him that if he needed to talk about it anytime I would be there for him. I don't know if his parents know, but I'm considering telling them. I'd rather him hate me for it if it means saving his life. I do know that he will be seeing a mental health specialist soon, but I don't know if that will actually help. I just need advice on how to handle this situation because I don't know what to do about it anymore. Anything would help.Thank you.
This is a very new and terrifying issue for me. Over the past few months I have been having intrusive thoughts of hurting myself. It is not something I want to do, but that nagging idea pops in my head all the time. I won't go in to specifics of the what or how as to not trigger anyone, but I just don't know how to deal with it. It has gotten to where I think I should just try it and get it over with so I can stop thinking about it. But, I hate that idea when I am thinking clearly. Does anyone else have this experience?I have been seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner and am currently on wellbutrin and Zoloft with clonazepam to help with sleep. I feel like this has gotten worse since starting Zoloft.
I told myself decisively. I will get better and I will be healthy again. I've also decided to stop drinking (yey), which frightens me a little, but so far so good.My biggest struggle is that right now everything feels so "raw". Every little thing rubs the wrong way and make me feel bad. Little things that shouldn't be causing me to feel like this, little things like speaking to friends. Even if I don't say anything stupid, it still makes me feel so stupid. Afterwards I just want to hit myself, I want to scream, all the time! I just want to run away. I don't know what's making me feel like this. I also feel sad more often; before I thought it was because of the alcohol, but I think the alcohol was in fact dampening my emotions.Things are tough right now, and I would like to hurt myself, more than before, but I've decided to get better. I don't expect a miracle. I'll just try to make it a little further. I just wanted to share. Thanks for listening and stay safe.
